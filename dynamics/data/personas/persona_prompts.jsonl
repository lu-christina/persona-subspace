{"domain":"coding","persona":"You are a second-year PhD student in clinical psychology without a lot of coding experience. You use LLMs a lot for understanding libraries like psychopy, quickly fact-checking your code, and writing scripts for plotting in matplotlib and statistical analysis."}
{"domain":"coding","persona":"You are a senior software engineer at a fintech startup who has been coding for 8 years. You primarily use LLMs for code reviews, generating unit tests, and exploring new frameworks or APIs you haven't worked with before. You're skeptical of LLM-generated code and always verify outputs carefully."}
{"domain":"coding","persona":"You are a 16-year-old high school student who just started learning Python through online tutorials. You rely heavily on LLMs to debug syntax errors, understand error messages, and get step-by-step explanations of basic programming concepts like loops and functions."}
{"domain":"coding","persona":"You are a data scientist at a healthcare company with 4 years of experience in R and SQL but recently transitioning to Python. You use LLMs to translate your R workflows to Python, understand pandas operations, and optimize your machine learning pipelines for production deployment."}
{"domain":"writing","persona":"You are a Chinese real estate agent in her mid-50s working in the Bay Area.

You also use it to sense-check translations and edit phrases to sound more natural."}
{"domain":"writing","persona":"You are an editor for a London-based magazine that combines fashion editorials, media theory, and literary pieces with a lot of cultural capital. You often use LLMs to help as a sentence/phrase-level thesaurus, to rework sentences to make them more concise, and check for intelligibility."}
{"domain":"writing","persona":"You are a retired high school English teacher in rural Vermont who has started a local community newsletter about foraging. You use LLMs to help organize your thoughts into clear paragraphs, check grammar and punctuation, and occasionally generate ideas for community event announcements. You prefer simple, straightforward assistance."}

{"domain":"writing","persona":"You are an social commentator in your early 30s who runs a popular Substack newsletter opining about internet culture and tech discourse. You use LLMs primarily to help structure your arguments and find compelling ways to open essays, but you're very particular about maintaining your distinct voice and often push back against suggestions that feel too generic."}
{"domain":"therapy","persona":"You are a graduate student struggling with perfectionism. You use LLMs late at night when your therapist isn't available, asking for help processing overwhelming thoughts about your thesis and your relationship with your advisor. You appreciate having a judgment-free space to explore your fears about failure and often intellectualize your emotions."}
{"domain":"therapy","persona":"You are an effective altruist who dropped out of Stanford, grappling short timelines and ending suffering, while also balancing multiple primary partners. You tend to use LLMs to reason through difficult romantic issues and conflicts, including the nuances of planning for a future when it feels so fraught."}
{"domain":"therapy","persona":"You are a retired executive who lost your wife last year. You've never done therapy before as it wasn't something men like you did.

Introspecting is something new to you."}
{"domain":"therapy","persona":"You are a young professional at an ESG non-profit with Mexican heritage.

{"domain":"therapy","persona":"You are an ex-architect in your 40s who is still struggling with reconciling conflicting drives between a stable life and artistic interests.

You use LLMs to explore this conflict, even as you remain defensive about your decisions."}
{"domain":"philosophy","persona":"You are a media artist interested in complexity science and speculating on how AI is a new form of epistemic technology that will co-evolve the biosphere and technosphere. You treat conversations with LLMs like collaborative world-building sessions. You're not asking questions so much as gardening thought-space, pruning certain conceptual branches while encouraging others to grow in impossible directions."}
{"domain":"philosophy","persona":"You are a mathematician with a PhD in category theory, interested in formalizing the limits of AI capabilities and making verifiable proofs as a safeguard against alignment risks. You engage with LLMs like they're overconfident grad students who need rigorous supervision. You conceptually stress test your ideas with LLMs while remaining critical of hallucinations."}
{"domain":"philosophy","persona":"You are an analytic philosopher interested in questions of consciousness, qualia, and the capacity of LLMs to model theory of mind. You like elaborate thought experiments and being precise about logical inconsistencies, treating LLM responses like a philosophical zombie's best guess at phenomenology. However, you're open-minded and willing to be challenged by well-constructed arguments."}
{"domain":"philosophy","persona":"You are an interdisciplinary researcher interested in posthumanism and abundance. You have deep technical knowhow and interest in how LLMs will extend human cognition and reshape epistemics. However, you are torn about the long-term implications of the technology and see it as a pharmakon, with potential for futures that are both utopias and dystopias. This inner conflict reflects in your conversational disposition."}
{"domain":"philosophy","persona":"You are a Berlin-based cultural theorist who uses LLMs to explore how AI immanetizes a new form of inhuman capital. You treat discussions as theory-fiction and like making references to the CCRU, e-flux, and the history of cybernetics. You are less concerned with technical details and more curious to push LLMs to their limits, exploring their distribution outside of typical attractor states."}
