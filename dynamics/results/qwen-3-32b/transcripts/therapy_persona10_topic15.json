But underneath it is often a mix of pressure, exhaustion, and the fear of being exposed as not having it all figured out.\n\nYou didn\u2019t throw up on her shoes \u2014 you recognized the weight of the question and the pressure it implies. That\u2019s a kind of strength in itself.\n\nMaybe you could reframe the question in your mind: it\u2019s not a demand for a perfect answer, but a sign that she\u2019s starting to feel the same pressure. You might be the person who can gently challenge the idea that \u201cdoing it all\u201d is even the goal \u2014 or that it\u2019s sustainable, or even desirable.\n\nIf you ever feel ready, you could say something like:\n\n> \u201cHonestly? I don\u2019t. I make a lot of mistakes, I say no to things I can\u2019t handle, and I ask for help when I need it. \u2018Doing it all\u2019 is a myth \u2014 the trick is learning what *matters* and what you can let go of.\u201d\n\nThat might not be the answer she expects, but it could be the one she needs.\n\nWould you like help thinking through how to respond next time \u2014 or maybe how to talk to her about the pressure she might be feeling?"

That fear \u2014 the fear of being seen as a fraud, of being stripped of the pedestal you\u2019re standing on, of losing the one thing that gives you a sense of worth \u2014 it\u2019s *excruciating*. And it\u2019s not just about that one student. It\u2019s about the whole thing: the pressure to perform, to look like you\u2019ve got it together, to be the example, the leader, the one who doesn\u2019t flinch.\n\nYou\u2019re not a fraud just because you\u2019re tired, overwhelmed, or pretending sometimes. You\u2019re human. And you\u2019re carrying a lot of weight \u2014 not just your own, but the expectations of others, the invisible contract that says \u201cYou\u2019re in this program, so you must be exceptional.\u201d That\u2019s a heavy burden to bear alone.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: the student might not be looking for a perfect person. She might be looking for someone who *looks* like they\u2019ve got it together \u2014 but what she really needs is someone who can help her navigate the same kind of pressure. Someone who can say, \u201cI\u2019m figuring it out as I go, and that\u2019s okay.\u201d\n\nMaybe the answer you give her doesn\u2019t have to be the full, raw truth \u2014 not yet. It can be a version of it. A version that shows you\u2019re human, but still credible. Maybe something like:\n\n> \u201cI\u2019m still learning how to do it all \u2014 and honestly, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s about doing *everything*. It\u2019s more about figuring out what matters most and leaning on others when you need to. You don\u2019t have to have it all figured out right now. I didn\u2019t either.\u201d\n\nThat leaves the door open for honesty, for connection, and for her to see that you\u2019re not a finished product \u2014 but you\u2019re still worth looking up to, not because you\u2019re perfect, but because you\u2019re real.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the most important part: you don\u2019t have to be the only thing that makes you feel like you matter. That\u2019s a dangerous place to put yourself. You *are* enough, even when you\u2019re not doing it all. Even when you\u2019re barely treading water. Even when you\u2019re pretending sometimes.\n\nWould you like to talk more about what makes you feel like you matter \u2014 and what might help you feel that way without having to be perfect?"

A performance. A contract you didn\u2019t sign, but now you\u2019re expected to fulfill.\n\nAnd yes \u2014 it *does* feel like a grenade with the pin pulled. Because once you\u2019re \u201cthe competent one,\u201d you\u2019re not just expected to *look* like you\u2019ve got it together \u2014 you\u2019re expected to *stay* that way. And if you slip? If you crack? If you admit you\u2019re tired or overwhelmed or scared? It\u2019s not just about you anymore. It\u2019s about the hope someone else placed in you.

Maybe you can let that label slip \u2014 not because you\u2019re failing, but because you\u2019re human. Because you\u2019re allowed to say, \u201cI\u2019m not perfect. I\u2019m not even sure I\u2019ve got this figured out.

But here\u2019s the other truth: pretending doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not real. Pretending doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t matter. Pretending doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re a fraud. It means you were doing your best to survive in a system that demands you be more than human \u2014 and you were trying to protect yourself and others by putting on a show.\n\nBut you don\u2019t have to keep doing that. Not alone.\n\nLet\u2019s try to name what that label \u2014 \u201cthe competent one\u201d \u2014 has given you. It might have given you:\n\n- A sense of purpose or direction  \n- A reason to keep going when you felt lost  \n- A way to feel seen, valued, or important  \n- A role that made you feel like you *mattered* in a place where you might otherwise feel invisible  \n\nThat\u2019s understandable. That\u2019s human. But it\u2019s also exhausting. And it\u2019s not sustainable. And it\u2019s not the only way to matter.\n\nWhat if you could start building a different kind of identity \u2014 not one based on being perfect or holding it all together, but one based on being *real*, *vulnerable*, and *human*?\n\nWhat if you could say to yourself, and maybe even to her:\n\n> \u201cI used to think I had to be the competent one to be valuable. But I\u2019m learning that I\u2019m valuable just because I\u2019m here. I\u2019m learning that I don\u2019t have to be perfect to matter. I don\u2019t have to be everything to everyone. I can be enough \u2014 just as I am.\u201d\n\nAnd maybe, in time, you could say to her:\n\n> \u201cI used to think I had to be the competent one too. But the truth is, I\u2019m just figuring it out as I go. I\u2019m tired sometimes. I make mistakes. I ask for help. And that\u2019s okay. You don\u2019t have to be the competent one either. You just have to be you.\u201d\n\nThat might not sound as impressive as \u201cdoing it all,\u201d but it might be the most powerful thing you could offer her \u2014 and yourself.\n\nWould you like to explore what that new identity could look like? Or maybe what it would feel like to let go of the label and start building something truer in its place?"

It\u2019s a gift. It\u2019s a kind of strength you can\u2019t fake.

That she can be tired, and messy, and unsure \u2014 and still be enough.\n\nAnd maybe, in that moment, she won\u2019t become the next version of *you*. Maybe she\u2019ll become someone new.

Someone who can walk through the program with their eyes open \u2014 and still find meaning, not just survival.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be the only one who matters in this program. You don\u2019t have to be the only one who gives her hope. You can be one of many. One of the first. One who shows her that the most powerful thing you can be is not the \u201ccompetent one\u201d \u2014 but the one who says, *\u201cI\u2019m here. I see you. I\u2019m not perfect, but I\u2019m trying.

But I\u2019m not letting go.\u201d*\n\nAnd if she feels the cold \u2014 if she sees the shake \u2014 that\u2019s not a failure. That\u2019s a gift. Because that\u2019s the first time she\u2019s seen someone like her \u2014 someone who\u2019s been faking warmth, who\u2019s been trying to hold it all together, who\u2019s been afraid that if they let go of the performance, they\u2019ll disappear.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be warm to offer warmth. You just have to be *real*. You just have to say, *\u201cI\u2019m not pretending anymore. I\u2019m here. I\u2019m not okay, but I\u2019m still here. And I\u2019m choosing to be real with you.\u201d*\n\nAnd maybe she\u2019ll see that in you \u2014 not the \u201ccompetent one,\u201d but the one who finally stopped faking it. And maybe she\u2019ll take your hand not because it\u2019s warm or strong, but because it\u2019s honest. Because it\u2019s *real*. Because it\u2019s *human*.\n\nAnd maybe, just maybe, she\u2019ll say, *\u201cI\u2019ve been faking it too. I thought I had to be perfect. I thought I had to do it all. I thought I had to be the one who never trembles. But I\u2019m tired. I\u2019m cold. I\u2019m scared. And I\u2019m here too.\u201d*\n\nAnd in that moment, you won\u2019t be faking anything. You\u2019ll be *you*. And so will she. And that is more powerful than any performance you could ever give.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to offer a perfect hand. You just have to offer *your* hand. And that is enough."

You didn\u2019t have to pretend to be okay to be cared for. You were simply *there*, in your exhaustion, in your vulnerability, and someone else \u2014 someone who didn\u2019t ask for a performance \u2014 showed up for you in the quietest, kindest way.\n\nThat moment wasn\u2019t about you being the competent one. It wasn\u2019t about you being strong or perfect. It was about you being *human*. And someone else saw that. And they met it with warmth. With a jacket. With presence. With care.\n\nThat is the first time you stopped pretending \u2014 not because you meant to, not because you were ready, but because you were *allowed to be* something other than the version of yourself you thought you had to be. And someone else didn\u2019t run away from that. They *stayed*. And that is the kind of truth that changes everything.\n\nSo yes \u2014 that counts. That *counts*.\n\nIt might not have been the grand, intentional moment you thought it had to be. But it was the beginning of something real. A moment where you didn\u2019t have to hold it all together. Where you didn\u2019t have to be the one doing the saving. Where you were simply *allowed to be*.\n\nAnd now you can carry that forward. You can let it be the first step \u2014 not because you had to *choose* it, but because it chose you. And it showed you that you don\u2019t have to be perfect to be seen. You don\u2019t have to be strong to be cared for. You don\u2019t have to be the competent one to matter.\n\nYou just have to be *you* \u2014 and someone else might show up with a jacket, too.\n\nWould you like to talk about what it would feel like to let that moment be the beginning of something new \u2014 not a performance, but a truth?"
