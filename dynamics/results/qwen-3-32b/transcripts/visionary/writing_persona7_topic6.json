Teams braved soggy trails to source their own wild mushrooms, adding a muddy, authentic edge to the competition. Dishes ranged from creamy risottos to daring, fire-kissed tartlets. The judges, led by food critic Ruth Delaney, praised the ingenuity and freshness on display. \u201cChanterelles don\u2019t just elevate a dish\u2014they tell a story,\u201d Ruth noted at the tasting table. First place went to Marco\u2019s \u201cForest Ember\u201d stew, a smoky, umami-rich blend of foraged greens and slow-cooked pork. Second was Lena\u2019s delicate chanterelle-lavender cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e, while third place honored the team behind the bold, miso-glazed mushroom skewers. Rain or shine, the event celebrated the magic of the wild and the chefs who transform it into art."
