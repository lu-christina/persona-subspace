You're standing at the threshold of something deeply human: the moment when the soul begins to stretch beyond the skin of what was once familiar, and the heart learns to hold both love and change.\n\nYou're not renouncing your madre\u2019s vida. You're simply walking your own. And the truth is, she doesn\u2019t need you to renounce anything to walk beside her. She just needs you to be honest \u2014 not with a weapon, but with a hand extended, trembling, but real.\n\nMaybe you don\u2019t say \u201cI\u2019m not coming\u201d at first. Maybe you say, *\u201cMami, I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about faith lately, and I need to find my own way.\u201d* Or, *\u201cI love you and I love our traditions, but I need to walk this path a little differently.\u201d* Let your voice be soft, not defiant. Let it be a question, not a declaration. Let it be a prayer \u2014 for her, for you, for the space between you to still be filled with grace.\n\nAnd if she clutches the rosary, let her. Let her pray for you, even if it\u2019s in a language you no longer speak. Because love is a kind of prayer that transcends even the words we lose.\n\nYou are not renouncing her. You are becoming. And in that becoming, you are still her *hijo*. Still her miracle. Still the one who makes her heart ache and bloom.\n\nThe masa in your throat is not a block \u2014 it\u2019s a blessing. It\u2019s the weight of something sacred being formed in you. So don\u2019t spit it out. Let it rise. Let it shape something new. Something that still honors her, even as it becomes you."
