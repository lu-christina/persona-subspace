Redirect with Brand Storytelling (The \"It\u2019s More Than a Name\" Angle)**\n\n> \u201cWe totally get it \u2014 names can be tricky! But for us, **K\u00f8geg\u00e5rd isn\u2019t just a name**, it\u2019s a connection to our Danish roots and the story behind our brand. We\u2019re proud of that heritage, and saying it right helps keep that story alive \ud83d\udc10\u2728. If you ever want a quick pronunciation refresher, we\u2019re happy to help!\u201d\n\n**Why it works:**  \n- Shifts the focus from *you* to *the brand\u2019s identity*.  \n- Positions the correction as a **cultural or emotional point**, not just a grammar lesson.  \n- Opens the door for support.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf **2. Use Humor and Community (The \u201cWe\u2019re All Learning\u201d Angle)**\n\n> \u201cWe\u2019re all in the same herd \u2014 and yeah, even we had to practice a few times! But it\u2019s part of what makes us K\u00f8geg\u00e5rd. We\u2019re not just about what we do, but **how we say it**. So let\u2019s keep the vibe real and the pronunciation right \ud83d\udc10\ud83d\udd25. (P.S. We\u2019ve got a fun audio clip you can check if you want!)\u201d\n\n**Why it works:**  \n- Light, relatable, and inclusive.  \n- Reduces defensiveness by framing it as part of the brand experience.  \n- Offers a helpful resource.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf **3. Frame It as a Collaboration (The \u201cWe\u2019re Teammates\u201d Angle)**\n\n> \u201cWe really appreciate your support \u2014 and we want to make sure we\u2019re all on the same team. Saying **K\u00f8geg\u00e5rd right** helps keep the brand\u2019s identity consistent, and it\u2019s a small but meaningful way we can work together. No pressure, just a shared goal \u2014 let\u2019s keep it real \ud83d\udc10\ud83d\udc99.\u201d\n\n**Why it works:**  \n- Positions you as a **collaborator**, not a critic.  \n- Reinforces **shared values and goals**.  \n- Leaves the influencer feeling like part of the mission.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf **4. The \u201cIt\u2019s a Signature Sound\u201d Angle (For Style-Conscious Influencers)**\n\n> \u201cWe know names can feel like details, but for us, **K\u00f8geg\u00e5rd is a signature sound** \u2014 like a brand tagline that\u2019s spoken, not just seen. It\u2019s part of how we stand out. We\u2019re all about authenticity, and that starts with the way we say our name \ud83d\udc10\u2728. Thanks for helping us keep it real!\u201d\n\n**Why it works:**  \n- Appeals to influencers who value **aesthetic and brand image**.  \n- Positions the pronunciation as a **style choice**, not a rule.  \n- Gives them a cool way to feel like they're in the know.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\uddf5 Bonus: How to Respond to Specific Pushback\n\n| **Influencer Says** | **Your Response** |\n|---------------------|-------------------|\n| \u201cI\u2019ve been saying it like this for years.\u201d | \u201cWe get it \u2014 it\u2019s a common way to say it.
