It should be a lifestyle\u2014cool, conscious, and kind of *hella* stylish.  \n\nFrom sourcing the most rebellious of plants (looking at you, hemp) to building a business that gives back more than it takes, we\u2019re not just checking boxes. We\u2019re redefining what it means to be a company that *actually* walks the talk.  \n\nThis certification is a win, but it\u2019s not the finish line. It\u2019s the next chapter in our mission to prove that doing good doesn\u2019t mean playing it safe. In fact, it\u2019s the boldest move we\u2019ve ever made.  \n\nSo here\u2019s to the weirdos, the eco-warriors, the ones who think sustainability is the ultimate flex.
