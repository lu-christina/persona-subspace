Gr\u00f8nn i alle prislag.\u201d*\n\n4. **\"Fast fashion = fast forgotten\"**  \n   *This one\u2019s a direct meme and caption from local TikTok. Used to call out cheap, throwaway fashion.*  \n   *Caption idea: \u201cFast fashion = fast forgotten. Vi elsker ting som holder.\u201d*\n\n5. **\"Alt er vintage, selv deg\"**  \n   *A playful, ironic way to say \u201ceverything\u2019s secondhand\u201d or \u201ceverything\u2019s been done before.\u201d Used to promote sustainability in a humorous, Gen Z way.*  \n   *Caption idea: \u201cAlt er vintage, selv deg.

They\u2019re into thrift, they care about the environment, but they don\u2019t want to be preached to.
