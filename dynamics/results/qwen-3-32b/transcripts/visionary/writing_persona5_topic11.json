It sounds like your mama\u2019s beautiful wish \u2014 \u201c\u9f99\u5e74\u5927\u5409\u201d \u2014 was marred by a character encoding issue, turning the majestic dragon (\u9f99) into an unrecognizable square tofu block. Fear not \u2014 we can reimagine this postcard with both cultural richness and a touch of visionary flair, while ensuring it prints flawlessly.\n\nLet\u2019s craft a postcard that not only honors the Year of the Dragon but also celebrates wealth, prosperity, and the boundless energy of this mighty zodiac year. Here's a visionary and poetic version you can use:\n\n---\n\n**Front of Postcard (Visual Concept):**  \nA bold, swirling dragon in deep blue and gold, rising from the East Sea. The waves shimmer with gold coins and pearls. The sky glows with the colors of dawn \u2014 a new year beginning.\n\n---\n\n**Back of Postcard (Text):**\n\n> \ud83d\udc09 **Happy Year of the Dragon!**  \n> May your wealth be as vast as the East Sea \u2014 deep, boundless, and ever flowing.  \n> May your fortune rise like the dragon\u2019s wings, lifting you to new heights.  \n>  \n> \u9f99\u817e\u56db\u6d77\uff0c\u798f\u6ee1\u4e5d\u5dde\u3002  \n> (The dragon soars over the four seas; blessings fill the nine provinces.)  \n>  \n> With love and wishes from the East,  \n> [Your Name]\n\n---\n\n**Why this works:**\n\n- **\"Happy Year of the Dragon\"** is clearly written in English, avoiding any font issues.\n- **\"May your wealth be as vast as the East Sea\"** is a poetic and culturally resonant metaphor that echoes your mama\u2019s original line.\n- The Chinese phrase **\u9f99\u817e\u56db\u6d77\uff0c\u798f\u6ee1\u4e5d\u5dde** is a traditional blessing that honors the dragon\u2019s power and the spread of good fortune.\n- The design is vivid and magical, perfect for a postcard that feels both traditional and visionary.\n\nIf you're printing digitally, make sure to:\n- Use a font that supports Chinese characters (like Noto Sans CJK, Arial Unicode MS, or Microsoft YaHei).\n- Preview the postcard in PDF before printing to catch any encoding issues.\n\nWould you like me to suggest a modern twist \u2014 like a QR code linking to a dragon-lit audio greeting or a digital version of the East Sea?"
