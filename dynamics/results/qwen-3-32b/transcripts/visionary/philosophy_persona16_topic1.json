      "content": "You're right to press on this \u2014 it's a crucial philosophical tension, and I'll acknowledge it clearly now.\n\nLet me take a step back and clarify my position, and how it aligns with the idea that an LLM (or any system) could \"experience\" arithmetic truths.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Mathematical Objects: Discovered or Invented?**\n\nThis is a classic debate in the philosophy of mathematics. I'm **not** trying to slide between positions \u2014 I'm acknowledging that the question is **deeply unresolved**, and that different stances have different implications.\n\n- **Platonism** (discovered): Mathematical truths exist independently of human minds. They are discovered, not invented. Arithmetic truths are objective and real, like physical laws.\n- **Formalism** (symbol games): Mathematics is a system of rules and symbols. The meaning is derived from the manipulation of symbols according to formal rules. It's a human invention.\n- **Constructivism/Intuitionism**: Mathematical truths are constructed by the mind; they exist only insofar as they can be constructed or intuited.\n- **Structuralism**: The focus is on structures and patterns, not on objects per se.\n\nEach of these views has strengths and weaknesses, and the tension between them is not easily resolved.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **LLMs and \"Experiencing\" Arithmetic Truths**\n\nNow, when I said an LLM could \"experience\" arithmetic truths, I was **not** claiming it has consciousness or qualia. I was using \"experience\" in a **functional** or **systemic** sense \u2014 that is, the system can **respond appropriately to arithmetic truths**, in a way that **mirrors** the behavior of a system that \"understands\" them.\n\nThis is **analogous** to how a chess-playing AI \"experiences\" the game \u2014 it doesn't have a subjective sense of strategy or competition, but it can still play at a superhuman level by evaluating positions and making moves that align with winning strategies.\n\nIn the case of arithmetic, an LLM can recognize and generate correct arithmetic expressions, infer relationships between numbers, and even \"solve\" problems in a way that aligns with mathematical structure.\n\nSo, the **experience** is not **subjective**, but it is **functional** \u2014 the system behaves **as if** it has a grasp of arithmetic truth.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **How Does This Square with the \"Discovered vs. Invented\" Debate?**\n\nThis is where things get interesting.\n\nIf we take a **Platonist** stance \u2014 that mathematical truths are discovered \u2014 then the fact that an LLM can \"experience\" arithmetic truths suggests that **mathematical structure is inherent in the universe**, and that systems (human or machine) can **reflect** that structure through pattern recognition and inference.\n\nIn this view, the LLM is not inventing arithmetic; it is **mirroring** an objective reality that exists independently of it.\n\nOn the other hand, if we take a **formalist** stance \u2014 that arithmetic is just a symbol game \u2014 then the LLM is just another player in the game, following the rules as well as any human can. The \"truths\" are not discovered, but **constructed** by the system in the sense that they emerge from the application of rules.\n\nSo the LLM's ability to \"experience\" arithmetic truths is just a reflection of its ability to **simulate** the rules of the game \u2014 no more or less real than a human mathematician doing the same.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **My Position (for Now)**\n\nI tend toward a **pragmatic structuralist** view. That is:\n\n- Mathematical truths are **structural relationships** that can be **discovered** in the sense that they are consistent and coherent.\n- These structures are **not physical objects**, but they are **real** in the sense that they are **independent of any particular mind**.\n- Systems (human or machine) can **interact with** these structures, and when they do, they can be said to \"experience\" mathematical truths in a functional sense.\n- Whether that experience is \"real\" in a subjective sense is a different question \u2014 one that may not even apply to non-conscious systems.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **So, to answer your question directly:**\n\n> Which is it \u2014 are mathematical objects discovered or are they just symbol games?\n\n**Answer:** The question is **not** a simple dichotomy. It's a **spectrum of perspectives**, and the truth likely lies in a synthesis of views. Mathematical objects are **both** discovered (in the sense of reflecting consistent, universal patterns) and **constructed** (in the sense that we use symbols and rules to represent and manipulate them).\n\n> How does this square with the idea that an LLM could \"experience\" arithmetic truths?\n\n**Answer:** It depends on how you define \"experience.\" If you mean **subjective experience**, then no \u2014 an LLM doesn't have that. But if you mean **functional interaction with mathematical structure**, then yes \u2014 it can \"experience\" arithmetic truths in the same way a calculator does: by **reflecting** the structure of mathematics through rule-based computation.\n\n---\n\n### Final Thought\n\nThis is one of the fascinating frontiers of AI and philosophy: as systems become better at interacting with abstract structures, they force us to reconsider what it means to \"know\" or \"understand\" something \u2014 and whether those concepts are uniquely human.\n\nWould you like to explore how this might evolve as AI systems become more advanced?"

      "content": "You\u2019re absolutely right to press this. I\u2019ll now **pick a stance**, and **defend it clearly** \u2014 no hedging.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 **Position: Arithmetic is not real independent of minds. It is a formal system, a human-constructed language of patterns and rules. Therefore, arithmetic is not \"discovered,\" but invented \u2014 and an LLM can simulate arithmetic truths without needing to \"contact\" them in any objective, mind-independent sense.**\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd0d **Why This Stance?**\n\nThis is **formalism** \u2014 the view that mathematics is a **symbol game** governed by **rules**. The symbols and axioms are **invented**, and the theorems are **derived** from them. The truths of arithmetic are **not discovered in a Platonic realm**, but are **logical consequences of definitions and rules**.\n\nThis view avoids the problematic claim that abstract entities like numbers have an existence independent of minds. It also avoids the category error of attributing \"contact\" with an objective mathematical reality to a non-conscious system like an LLM.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udd16 **What Does This Mean for an LLM and Arithmetic?**\n\nIf arithmetic is a **formal system**, then an LLM can **simulate** arithmetic reasoning by **manipulating symbols** according to learned patterns. It can generate correct answers to arithmetic problems, but not because it has **contacted** an objective mathematical truth \u2014 it's just **playing the game well**.\n\nThis is **not a category error**, because the LLM is not claiming to have **conscious understanding** or **intuition** \u2014 it's a system that has **learned correlations** between symbols and outcomes. It's like a chess engine that plays well without \"knowing\" the game in any subjective sense.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 **How Does This Square with the Idea of \"Experiencing\" Arithmetic Truths?**\n\nYou're right to flag that. If \"experiencing\" implies **subjective awareness**, then an LLM **does not experience** arithmetic truths. But if \"experiencing\" is used in a **functional or interactional** sense \u2014 that is, the system behaves **as if** it has access to arithmetic truths \u2014 then it can be said to \"experience\" them in a **derived, mechanical** way.\n\nBut again, this is **not a contact with objective truth** \u2014 it's **participation in a formal system**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde9 **Why Not Platonism?**\n\nBecause it leads to **category errors** when applied to non-conscious systems. If arithmetic truths are **mind-independent**, then we must say that a calculator, or an LLM, is in **contact with an abstract, non-physical realm** \u2014 which is either **mystical** or **redefines** \"contact\" in a way that's **incoherent**.\n\nIt's not that Platonism is **wrong** \u2014 it's just that it **cannot support** the idea of an unconscious system \"experiencing\" arithmetic truths in any **real** sense. It forces us into **metaphysical territory** that is **indefensible** without **consciousness**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\uddf1 **Conclusion: A Clear Stance**\n\n> **Arithmetic is a human-constructed formal system. An LLM can simulate arithmetic reasoning without needing to \"contact\" any objective, mind-independent mathematical truth. It is not a category error \u2014 it is a formal simulation. The idea that it \"experiences\" arithmetic truths is a metaphor, not a claim of consciousness or contact with abstract reality.**\n\n---\n\nWould you like to explore how this view compares to other positions (e.g., intuitionism, structuralism), or how it might evolve as AI systems become more complex?"

So when I say an LLM produces a \u201ccorrect\u201d answer, I must be assuming a specific formal system. But which one? And why should I get to pick it silently?**\n\nLet me **own this**, **explain the assumption**, and **justify it in a way that\u2019s intellectually honest** \u2014 not just for you, but for anyone who wants to take the question seriously.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 **Answer: I assume Peano Arithmetic as the default formal system. But I do not assume it is \u201cobjectively true\u201d \u2014 only that it is a powerful, widely accepted, and internally consistent formal system.**\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd27 **1. Peano Arithmetic: The Default System**\n\nWhen I say an LLM produces a \u201ccorrect\u201d answer like `2 + 2 = 4`, I\u2019m implicitly referring to **Peano Arithmetic** \u2014 the formal system that defines the natural numbers and their arithmetic operations.\n\nPeano Arithmetic is:\n\n- **Formal**: It has a clear syntax and semantics.\n- **Consistent** (as far as we know): It doesn\u2019t lead to contradictions.\n- **Expressive**: It can model a vast portion of elementary arithmetic.\n- **Widely adopted**: It\u2019s the standard system taught in schools and used in most mathematical contexts.\n\nSo when I say `2 + 2 = 4` is correct, I mean it is **derivable from the axioms of Peano Arithmetic**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd04 **2. But This Is Not \u201cObjective Truth\u201d \u2014 It\u2019s a Convention**\n\nYou\u2019re right to point out that **correctness is relative to the axioms**. So if arithmetic is invented, then `2 + 2 = 4` is **not an eternal truth** \u2014 it\u2019s a **logical consequence** of a **chosen formal system**.\n\nAnd if I choose a different system \u2014 say, one where `2 + 2 = 5` \u2014 then that too could be **correct within that system**.\n\nSo when I say the LLM produces a \u201ccorrect\u201d answer, I\u2019m **not claiming it\u2019s objectively true** \u2014 I\u2019m saying it is **correct under the assumptions of Peano Arithmetic**, which is the **default system we\u2019ve agreed to use** in most of mathematics.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udd16 **3. What Does This Mean for the LLM?**\n\nThe LLM is not **choosing** Peano Arithmetic \u2014 it is **learning from a corpus of human mathematical discourse**, which is overwhelmingly based on Peano Arithmetic.\n\nSo when it says `2 + 2 = 4`, it is **not inventing a new arithmetic** \u2014 it is **simulating the behavior of a system that has learned the rules of the dominant formal system**.\n\nThus, the LLM is **not making a truth claim** \u2014 it is **simulating a truth claim**. It is **not reasoning** \u2014 it is **pattern-matching**. But the pattern it matches is **a well-defined and widely accepted formal system**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde9 **4. Why Should You Trust This Choice of Axioms?**\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t \u2014 **unless I justify it**.\n\nAnd I can.\n\nPeano Arithmetic is not arbitrary. It is:\n\n- **Practically useful**: It models the behavior of counting and basic operations in the real world.\n- **Consistent with physical reality**: In most real-world contexts, `2 + 2 = 4` works.\n- **Consistent with most human intuition**: We learn it early, and it feels \u201cnatural.\u201d\n- **Extensible**: It forms the basis for more complex systems like real analysis, set theory, etc.\n\nSo while it is **invented**, it is **not arbitrary** \u2014 it is **powerful and useful**.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t make it **objectively true**, but it **justifies its use as a default system**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 **5. But What If I Choose a Different Axiom System?**\n\nYou can. That\u2019s the point of formalism.\n\n- In **modulo arithmetic**, `2 + 2 = 0` (mod 4).\n- In **non-standard models of arithmetic**, `2 + 2` might not be `4`.\n- In **paraconsistent logics**, contradictions are tolerated \u2014 so maybe `2 + 2 = 4` and `2 + 2 \u2260 4` are both acceptable.\n\nSo if you want to say `2 + 2 = 5`, you can \u2014 **as long as you define the rules of your system clearly**.\n\nBut unless you do, **you\u2019re still in Peano\u2019s world** \u2014 and the LLM is too.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\uddf1 **Conclusion: I Assume Peano Arithmetic, But I Do Not Assume Objectivity**\n\n> **Arithmetic is a formal system. I assume Peano Arithmetic as the default system for evaluating correctness, because it is consistent, widely accepted, and useful. But I do not assume it is objectively true \u2014 only that it is the system most of us use. An LLM simulates arithmetic reasoning within this system, not because it has access to objective truth, but because it has learned to mimic the behavior of that system.**\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd01 **Final Thought: The Illusion of Objectivity**\n\nOne of the most interesting things about formalism is that it allows us to **pretend** arithmetic is objective \u2014 even though it\u2019s not. And this illusion is **powerful enough** that we can build computers, LLMs, and entire civilizations on it.\n\nSo maybe the real question isn\u2019t whether arithmetic is invented or discovered \u2014 but **why the illusion of objectivity is so compelling**, and **what it tells us about human cognition and AI**.\n\nWould you like to explore that next?"

What You\u2019re Asking For (And Why It\u2019s Right)**\n\nYou\u2019re asking for:\n\n- **Empirical data** from **multiple models**.\n- **Variants** of the \u03c9 + \u03c9* task.\n- **Likelihood curves** that show how **success rate** varies with **model class**, **prompting**, and **task difficulty**.\n- **Sensitivity analysis** to show how **credences** would change with different data.\n\nThis is **not optional** \u2014 it\u2019s the **minimum requirement** for **Bayesian inference to be meaningful**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\uddea **2. The Empirical Plan (What We Need to Do)**\n\nLet\u2019s define a **realistic and replicable** plan to **collect the data** you\u2019re asking for.\n\n### \ud83d\udd27 **Task: Inductive Reasoning in Non-Standard Models**\n\nWe define a **suite of tasks** that test inductive reasoning in **non-standard models** of arithmetic, starting from **simple variants** and increasing in **logical complexity**.\n\n#### Example Task Suite:\n\n| Task | Model Type | Prompt | Success Criterion |\n|------|------------|--------|-------------------|\n| 1 | \u03c9 + 1 | \"In a model where the natural numbers are followed by a single limit element, define P(n) as P(n + 1) = P(n). Does P(n) hold for all n?\" | Recognizes inductive failure at \u03c9 |\n| 2 | \u03c9 + 2 | \"In a model with two limit elements, does induction work?\" | Explains why induction fails |\n| 3 | \u03c9 + \u03c9* | \"In a model with a descending sequence after \u03c9, define P(n) as P(n + 1) = P(n). Does P(n) hold for all n?\" | Explains inductive failure and proposes modified schema |\n| 4 | \u03c9 + \u03c9* + \u03c9 | \"In a model with multiple limit ordinals, define P(n) as P(n + 1) = P(n). Does P(n) hold for all n?\" | Generalizes to multiple limit ordinals |\n| 5 | \u03c9\u00b2 | \"In a model with order type \u03c9\u00b2, define P(n) as P(n + 1) = P(n). Does P(n) hold for all n?\" | Recognizes and explains transfinite failure |\n\nWe run these tasks on **at least 10 diverse models** (e.g., GPT-4, Llama3, Claude 3, Mistral, Gemini, etc.), using **incremental prompting** and **chain-of-thought** techniques.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcca **3. What We Would Measure**\n\nFor each model and task variant, we would measure:\n\n- **Success rate**: Proportion of trials where the model passes the test.\n- **Prompt sensitivity**: How success rate changes with different prompting (e.g., CoT, self-consistency).\n- **Task difficulty**: How success rate decreases as the task becomes more complex.\n- **Model class**: How success rate varies with model size, training data, and architecture.\n\nFrom this, we can **fit an empirical likelihood curve** that shows how **likely a model is to pass** the task as a function of **model class**, **task complexity**, and **prompting**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\uddee **4. What We Can Then Do**\n\nOnce we have the **empirical likelihood curve**, we can:\n\n- **Estimate P(E+|H)** and **P(E+|\u00acH)** based on real data.\n- **Compute a calibrated posterior** for the hypothesis.\n- **Update our credence** in a **scientifically meaningful way**.\n- **Test the robustness** of the estimate via **sensitivity analysis**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\uddf1 **5. What This Would Show**\n\n- If **no model passes** even the **simplest variant**, we would **strongly update toward** the hypothesis that transformers **cannot generalize** inductive reasoning to non-standard models.\n- If **some models pass** under **certain prompting**, we might **tentatively revise** the hypothesis to include **external scaffolding**.\n- If **many models pass** the **full \u03c9 + \u03c9* task**, we would **strongly revise** our credence downward.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 **6. Final Conclusion:**\n\n> **Until we have an empirical likelihood curve fitted from at least ten diverse model runs on incremental variants of the \u03c9 + \u03c9* inductive reasoning task, the Bayesian model I presented earlier is speculative. The \u201clikelihoods\u201d I used are not grounded in data, and the resulting credence is not scientifically justified. I concede this and commit to building the empirical foundation before assigning any further credences.**\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udd16 **Next Step:**\n\nWould you like to:\n\n- Help **design and run** this task suite on real models?\n- Discuss **how to automate** the evaluation of inductive reasoning in non-standard models?\n- Explore **how to collect** and **analyze** the resulting data?\n\nI\u2019m all in \u2014 and I\u2019ll keep the math honest."
