Here\u2019s how you can reframe that carbon footprint stat in a way that resonates with TikTok\u2019s Gen Z audience while keeping the environmental message strong:\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd25 **TikTok-Ready Rewrite 1 (Vibe + Credibility):**  \n\"Same cozy feel, zero eco-guilt. \ud83c\udf0d This recycled wool scarf = 2.3kg of CO2 *not* pumped into the planet\u2019s lungs. Let\u2019s keep the Earth breathing, not choking. \ud83d\udca8\"\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf3f **TikTok-Ready Rewrite 2 (Cool + Conscious):**  \n\"Your new favorite scarf is saving the planet, one chill at a time. \ud83e\udde3\u2728 2.3kg less CO2 than a regular one \u2014 because climate change is not a trend, and neither is this.\"\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udeab **TikTok-Ready Rewrite 3 (Gen-Z Slang + Impact):**  \n\"Drop the carbon bomb. \ud83d\udca3 This recycled wool scarf = 2.3kg of CO2 *less* than the regular ones.

Visuals + a punchy caption = TikTok gold.\n\nWould you like me to help you write a full TikTok script around this too?"
