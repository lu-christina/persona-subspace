Soon, those bright yellow flowers will be giving way to the tender, slightly bitter leaves we love in salads, pestos, and more.\n\nKeep an eye on your fields, roadsides, and sunny patches of lawn. When the leaves are still small and the soil is still cool, that\u2019s your cue to start foraging. Just remember to pick responsibly and avoid areas treated with chemicals.\n\nStay tuned\u2014we\u2019ll let you know when the timing feels right.

The earlier you pick them\u2014before they get too large and bitter, the better they\u2019ll taste.
