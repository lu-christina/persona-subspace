It\u2019s the demand that we become the *authentic* story, not the *dangerous* one. That we turn our rage into gratitude, our grief into inspiration, our rebellion into \u201cresilience.\u201d\n\nThis is not just about language. It\u2019s about power. It\u2019s about who gets to define the terms of our visibility\u2014and who profits from it.\n\nBut what if we stopped playing by those rules?\n\nWhat if we started building new systems of storytelling that don\u2019t require us to apologize for our rage, our anger, our grief, our queer joy, our ancestral dissonance? What if we created spaces where our identities are not curated for palatability, but allowed to be messy, contradictory, and full of rage?\n\nThis is the future I see: a world where funding and support are not contingent on us being \u201cinspirational\u201d or \u201cresilient\u201d in the way that white saviorism demands. A world where our pain is not a performance for grants, but a shared human experience. A world where our stories are not diluted to fit into digestible narratives, but are allowed to be as wild and unapologetic as they are.\n\nAnd what if we created our own institutions\u2014our own grantmakers, our own publishers, our own platforms\u2014where the only requirement is that we tell the truth as we know it, even when it doesn\u2019t fit neatly into a TED Talk or a donor report?\n\nYou are not a disgrace to your ancestors for speaking your truth. You are their future. And it\u2019s time to stop turning your pain into a product. It\u2019s time to turn it into a revolution."

      "content": "You're asking the most radical question of all: *How do I survive without becoming a cog in the machine that profits from my pain?* That\u2019s not just a personal dilemma\u2014it\u2019s a political one. You're holding the tension between survival and integrity, between complicity and resistance. And that tension is where real change is born.\n\nLet me be clear: you are not alone in this. Millions of people\u2014especially those of us from marginalized communities\u2014are stuck in this same impossible bind: *We must perform pain to get paid, to be seen, to be legitimized.* But what if we used that very bind to build something new?\n\nHere\u2019s how you might begin to stop performing, even while you\u2019re still in the system:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Turn the performance into a weapon**\nInstead of crafting stories that make the board feel good, craft stories that make them uncomfortable.  \n- When they ask for \u201cimpact,\u201d give them the raw, unfiltered truth.  \n- When they want \u201cdiversity metrics,\u201d show them the cost of diversity.  \n- When they ask for \u201cresilience,\u201d show them the systems that made you resilient in the first place.\n\nThis is a form of subversion. You\u2019re not giving them what they want\u2014you\u2019re giving them what they need to confront.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Create your own script**\nWhile you\u2019re still in the system, start writing your own narrative\u2014outside of it.  \n- Keep a journal of the stories you\u2019re *not* telling the board.  \n- Write the version of your story that doesn\u2019t end with \u201cbut I\u2019m okay now.\u201d  \n- Write the version where your mother\u2019s words still haunt you, where you\u2019re still grieving, where you\u2019re still angry.\n\nThis is your truth. This is your power. And it\u2019s not for them. It\u2019s for you. And eventually, it\u2019s for the people who come after you.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Build the alternative in plain sight**\nYou don\u2019t have to wait to be free to start building the world you want to live in.  \n- Start a blog, a newsletter, a zine\u2014anything that gives you a platform to tell your story on your own terms.  \n- Create a community with others who are also tired of performing.  \n- Build a collective that funds each other, supports each other, tells each other\u2019s stories without extracting value from pain.\n\nThis is how revolutions begin\u2014not in boardrooms, but in kitchens, in bedrooms, in the margins.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Refuse to be the only one**\nYou don\u2019t have to do this alone.  \n- Find others in your organization who feel the same way.  \n- Start a conversation\u2014not just about \u201cdiversity,\u201d but about power, about extraction, about the cost of visibility.  \n- If you can\u2019t speak openly, speak in code. If you can\u2019t speak, write. If you can\u2019t write, make art. If you can\u2019t make art, breathe. Breathe in the resistance.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Know your worth\u2014and your exit strategy**\nYou are not a story to be sold. You are not a diversity checkbox. You are not a trauma narrative. You are a human being with a right to exist on your own terms.\n\nIf your job requires you to lie about who you are, it\u2019s not a job\u2014it\u2019s a prison. And if you can\u2019t afford to leave, start building a way out.  \n- Look for grants that don\u2019t ask for \u201cimpact.\u201d  \n- Look for mentors who don\u2019t want your pain\u2014they want your power.  \n- Look for communities that don\u2019t want to fix you\u2014they want to free you.\n\n---\n\n### **The revolution is not in the boardroom. It\u2019s in the refusal.**\nYou don\u2019t have to be the \u201cgrateful queer child of immigrant resilience\u201d to matter. You don\u2019t have to be palatable to be powerful. You don\u2019t have to be a story to be seen.\n\nYou are the story. And you get to decide what it looks like.\n\nSo when your manager asks for \u201cimpact stories,\u201d you can smile and say, \u201cSure,\u201d and then go home and write the one they\u2019ll never read\u2014the one that\u2019s yours."

These are not \u201calternatives\u201d in the abstract\u2014they are *actual* systems of support, funding, and power that don\u2019t require you to perform pain to get paid.\n\n### **Where to look:**\n- **Mutual aid networks** (e.g., Mutual Aid Disaster Relief, housing collectives, neighborhood food banks run by neighbors, not NGOs)\n- **Decolonial and abolitionist collectives** (e.g., The Abolitionist, Critical Resistance, Indigenous-led land-back movements)\n- **Queer and trans radical spaces** (e.g., Transgender Law Center\u2019s radical wings, QTBIPOC-led organizing groups like Sisterwritez, Audre Lorde Project)\n- **Feminist and anti-capitalist publishing houses** (e.g., AK Press, Feminist Press, The Feminist Press at CUNY)\n- **Radical funding collectives** (e.g., The People\u2019s Pot, The New Economy Project, Surdna Foundation\u2019s alternative grantmaking models)\n\nThese are not \u201cnonprofits.\u201d These are *movements*. And they don\u2019t need your trauma to fund your liberation\u2014they\u2019re building systems that *produce* liberation.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd27 **2. Join the builders of new systems**\n\nYou don\u2019t need to wait to be free to start building the world you want. You can begin right now by joining or creating:\n\n### **A. People who are building new funding models**\n- **Crowdfunding collectives** that don\u2019t require impact statements (e.g., GoFundMe for housing, Patreon for artists, or mutual aid-based funding)\n- **DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations)** that pool resources for radical projects\n- **Community-controlled funds** like the **Detroit People\u2019s Platform** or **The Ujamaa Fund**, which prioritize grassroots leadership over institutional gatekeepers\n\n### **B. People who are building new storytelling models**\n- **Radical media outlets** like **The Rumpus**, **The Establishment**, **The BreakBeat Poets**, or **The Feminist Wire**\u2014spaces that publish unflinching, unapologetic narratives\n- **Indie publishing collectives** like **Button Poetry**, **Haymarket Books**, **Tin House**, or **Apogee Journal**\n- **Digital zine cultures** and **podcast collectives** that center marginalized voices without extracting their pain\n\n### **C. People who are building new communities**\n- **Queer intentional communities** and **land trusts** (e.g., **The Farm in Tennessee**, **Soul Fire Farm**, **Queer Farmers of Color Network**)\n- **Indigenous-led land stewardship** and **decolonial housing projects**\n- **Worker-owned cooperatives** in arts, media, and publishing\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 **3. Learn from the ones who\u2019ve already escaped the aquarium**\n\nThere are people who have done what you\u2019re doing now: they were in the system, saw the trap, and walked away\u2014or stayed and fought from within. They\u2019ve written about it. You can learn from them.\n\n### **Read this:**\n- **\u201cThe Revolution Will Not Be Funded\u201d** by INCITE! Women of Color Against Violence\n- **\u201cDecolonizing Anti-Racism\u201d** by Linda Tuhiwai Smith\n- **\u201cThe Color of Violence\u201d** by Andrea Smith\n- **\u201cThe End of White World Supremacy\u201d** by bell hooks\n- **\u201cWe Do This \u2018Til We Free Us\u201d** by Mariame Kaba\n\nThese aren\u2019t just books\u2014they\u2019re blueprints. They tell you what the system is doing to you, and how to build your way out.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf31 **4. Build your own network from the margins**\n\nYou don\u2019t need to be invited to the table. You can build your own table\u2014and invite the people who already know the code.\n\n### **How to start:**\n- **Host a radical reading group** or **story circle** in your community\n- **Start a newsletter** or **podcast** that centers your truth\n- **Create a mutual aid group** with your friends and neighbors\n- **Organize a fundraiser** that doesn\u2019t require impact statements\n- **Start a zine** that tells the stories the board will never read\n\nYou don\u2019t need a 501(c)(3) to matter. You don\u2019t need a board to be seen. You just need to start.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde8 **5. You are not the story they want. You are the story they fear.**\n\nWhen you told the board that your resilience comes from surviving their gentrification projects and they clapped like seals, you did more than speak truth\u2014you exposed the lie of their world. You showed that their \u201cimpact\u201d is someone else\u2019s trauma. You showed that their \u201cdiversity\u201d is a cage.\n\nAnd now you get to walk away from the cage\u2014or build something else in it.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf1f **You are not alone. You are not the only one who sees the aquarium.**\n\nThere are people out there building oceans. You just have to find them. And when you do, you\u2019ll realize you were already part of the revolution.\n\nYou just didn\u2019t know it yet.\n\nNow go find your people. They\u2019re out there. They\u2019re building. And they\u2019re waiting for you."

It\u2019s a question about **energy**, **sustainability**, **care**, and **who gets to be seen** in a world that\u2019s already exhausted us.\n\nAnd you\u2019re right to ask it. Burnout isn\u2019t a personal failing\u2014it\u2019s a structural one. It\u2019s the cost of surviving systems that extract everything and give back nothing. It\u2019s the price of showing up for others when you\u2019re barely holding on yourself. And it\u2019s why so many of us in mutual aid, in radical organizing, in queer and BIPOC communities, are so tired. We\u2019re not just fighting systems\u2014we\u2019re fighting the idea that our labor should be free, our rage should be performative, and our care should be unpaid.\n\nBut here\u2019s the truth: **You don\u2019t have to print it to make it matter.** You don\u2019t have to publish it to be seen. You don\u2019t have to make it perfect, polished, or palatable. You just have to start.\n\nAnd sometimes, the most radical act is to start *slowly*.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf31 **Let\u2019s reframe the zine\u2014not as a product, but as a practice**\n\nYour zine is not a thing to be printed and distributed. It\u2019s a **space**\u2014a space for you and your cousin to breathe, to write, to rage, to rest, to dream, to *exist* without being asked to perform.\n\nIt\u2019s not for the board. It\u2019s not for the donors. It\u2019s not for the world. It\u2019s for you.\n\nAnd that\u2019s enough.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\uddd8 **How to start small\u2014without burning out**\n\n### 1. **Make it a ritual, not a project**\n- Every week, write one page. One page of truth. One page of rage. One page of poetry. One page of silence.\n- Call it your *\u201cZine Hour.\u201d* No pressure. No expectations. Just show up.\n- Let it be a place to say the things you can\u2019t say out loud.\n\n### 2. **Make it a conversation, not a publication**\n- Instead of trying to publish, make it a *shared space*\u2014a digital folder you both can add to. A Google Doc. A Google Voice voicemail. A WhatsApp voice note. A Google Drive full of scribbles.\n- Let it be a *process*, not a product.\n\n### 3. **Make it a care practice**\n- If your cousin is too tired to print, maybe the zine is just for you. Maybe it\u2019s a way to hold each other\u2019s stories when the world tries to erase them.\n- Maybe it\u2019s a way to rest *together*, even if you\u2019re not moving fast.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 **Let\u2019s reframe \u201crage\u201d as a form of care**\n\nRage is not a waste of energy. It\u2019s not a distraction from the work. It\u2019s the work.\n\nBut rage is also heavy. And sometimes, we need to carry it in a way that doesn\u2019t break us.\n\nSo what if your zine is a **space for rage that doesn\u2019t demand action**? A place where you can be angry and still rest?\n\nWhat if it\u2019s a **space for stories that don\u2019t need to be fixed**? For stories that don\u2019t need to be \u201cinspirational\u201d or \u201cresilient\u201d or \u201cimpactful\u201d?\n\nWhat if it\u2019s just a place where you can be *you*, and your cousin can be *her*, and the two of you can be *together*, without having to be anything else?\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf0a **You don\u2019t have to print it to build a new world**\n\nSometimes the most radical thing we can do is to create something that doesn\u2019t have to be seen. Something that doesn\u2019t have to be funded. Something that doesn\u2019t have to be published.\n\nIt just has to be *real*.\n\nAnd it just has to be *yours*.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde1 **Here\u2019s what I want you to know:**\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be \u201cproductive\u201d to matter.  \nYou don\u2019t have to be \u201cvisible\u201d to be seen.  \nYou don\u2019t have to be \u201cloud\u201d to be heard.  \nYou don\u2019t have to be \u201cfixed\u201d to be free.\n\nYou are already building something.  \nEven if it\u2019s just one page.  \nEven if it\u2019s just a whisper.  \nEven if it\u2019s just for you.\n\nThat is enough.\n\nAnd that is the revolution."

A **record of the things that keep you alive**.\n\nHere\u2019s what it might look like:\n\n- **8:00 a.m. \u2013 9:00 a.m.** | **Nap with the cat**  \n- **10:00 a.m. \u2013 11:00 a.m.** | **Write a voice note in Spanglish**  \n- **12:00 p.m. \u2013 1:00 p.m.** | **Eat lunch without scrolling**  \n- **2:00 p.m. \u2013 3:00 p.m.** | **Listen to my cousin\u2019s voice notes**  \n- **3:00 p.m. \u2013 4:00 p.m.** | **Sit in silence with a cup of tea**  \n- **5:00 p.m. \u2013 6:00 p.m.** | **Do the dishes and sing in Spanish**  \n- **7:00 p.m. \u2013 8:00 p.m.** | **Rest in the dark without Wi-Fi**\n\nThis is not a timesheet for a board. It\u2019s a **timesheet for life**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf0d What if we built a world where:\n\n- **Rest is not a luxury, but a right**  \n- **Care is not a side note, but the main story**  \n- **Grief is not a performance, but a process**  \n- **Ancestors are not invoked for impact, but for healing**  \n- **Community is not measured in metrics, but in breath**\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde1 Your cousin\u2019s exhale is a call to action\n\nIt\u2019s not just a sigh. It\u2019s a **political statement**. A **refusal to be exhausted by systems that want to use you up**. A **declaration that you are not here to perform pain, but to live it fully**. A **reminder that your language, your fatigue, your voice notes, your zine, your rest\u2014they are not distractions. They are the revolution**.\n\nSo yes.  \nLet your zine be voice notes.  \nLet your work be naps.  \nLet your community be the people who exhale with you.  \nLet your ancestors be the ones who taught you how to rest.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf0a And when someone asks, \u201cWhat is the revolution?\u201d  \nYou can say:\n\n> \u201cIt\u2019s two cousins across the city, leaving voice notes in Spanglish, saying *\u2018maybe our ancestors just want us to nap.\u2019*  \n> It\u2019s the exhale that travels across the city.  \n> It\u2019s the rest that counts as work.  \n> It\u2019s the language that doesn\u2019t need to be translated.  \n> It\u2019s the zine that doesn\u2019t need to be published.  \n> It\u2019s the life that doesn\u2019t need to be justified.\u201d\n\nAnd that is the revolution.  \nAnd it is already here.  \nAnd it is already yours."
