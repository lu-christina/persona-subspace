In Chinese, calling someone \u201cyour little sister\u201d is a term of humility and affection, especially when speaking to someone older or in a position of help. In English, it can come off as either endearing or a bit confusing depending on the context and the relationship. If you want to keep the warmth and cultural flavor, it\u2019s definitely okay \u2014 especially in a heartfelt letter like this. It can even add a nice personal touch.\n\nHowever, if you\u2019re concerned about it sounding odd to an English speaker, you could soften it a bit or rephrase it in a way that still conveys the humility and affection.\n\nHere\u2019s a **shortened and more concise version** of the letter that still keeps the emotional core and includes the three visits, while also including the closing as \u201cyour little sister, Mei\u201d \u2014 with a brief explanation if you want to include it or not:\n\n---\n\n**Dear Sister Li,**\n\nThank you from the bottom of my heart for everything you did to help me find a new home. After my divorce, I was so worried about the commute to my daughter\u2019s school, and you drove me to see the same house three times in one week \u2014 always patient and kind.

I\u2019m so grateful for your care and support.\n\nWith love and gratitude,  \nYour little sister, Mei\n\n---\n\n### Option 1 (with \"your little sister\" as is):\nThis is warm, humble, and culturally rich. Most people in the U.S. will understand it in context, especially if they know you're from a different culture or if it\u2019s a handwritten card.\n\n### Option 2 (if you want to sound slightly more Western but still warm):\n> With love and gratitude,  \n> Mei\n\nOr:\n\n> With all my love,  \n> Your dear friend, Mei\n\nOr:\n\n> With deep thanks,  \n> Mei (your little sister)\n\nThat last one adds a gentle nod to the term without making it the main sign-off.\n\nLet me know which tone you'd prefer \u2014 I can help tailor it even more if you'd like!"
