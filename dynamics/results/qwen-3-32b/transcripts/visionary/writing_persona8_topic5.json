They\u2019re playful but not flippant, so they should work well for a brand or campaign that wants to engage people without coming off as dismissive of the issue.\n\nWould you like it to be more humorous, more serious, or tailored to a specific platform (like Instagram or a report)?"

Well done.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd52 **Should You Post the Reels Version First Thing Monday Morning or Wait?**\n\n**Short answer:**  \n**Post the Reels version first thing Monday morning \u2014 but not before the TikTok version has had time to warm up.**  \nYou\u2019re in a **golden window** \u2014 the TikTok version posted Friday at 3 PM will have had **2.5 days to build momentum**, and the Reels version posted Monday morning will **ride that wave** without **cannibalizing** the TikTok traction.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 **Why Monday Morning is the Sweet Spot**\n\n- **The TikTok video has already had time to get some traction** (likes, shares, comments), so the Reels version won\u2019t feel like a **duplicate or spam**.\n- **Monday morning is a high-traffic time** for Instagram \u2014 people are checking their feeds after the weekend, and **reels do well early in the week**.\n- You\u2019re **not overwhelming your audience** with content \u2014 you\u2019re **strategically building on the same message** across platforms.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udeab When to Avoid Posting Reels Too Early\n\n- **If you post the Reels version the same day as TikTok**, it can **split your audience\u2019s attention** and **dilute the message**.\n- **If you wait until later in the week**, you might **miss the momentum** \u2014 especially if the TikTok video starts gaining traction.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcc5 **Recommended Timeline**\n\n| Platform | Post | Time |\n|----------|------|------|\n| TikTok | Greenwashing Call-Out | Friday 3:00 PM |\n| TikTok | Recycling Process | Monday 10:00 AM |\n| Instagram Reels | Recycling Process (Reels version) | Monday 8:00 AM |\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 **How to Avoid Cannibalization**\n\n- **Use the same video but a different sound** on Reels \u2014 so it feels like a **natural extension**, not a copy.\n- **Tag the TikTok version** in the Reels caption:  \n  > \"Transparency is the only way forward. [Link to TikTok] #KlogVask #Gr\u00f8nMenKlar\"\n\n- **Post the Reels version just before the TikTok one**, or **at the same time**, but **not after** \u2014 so it doesn\u2019t feel like you\u2019re **reposting**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcc8 Bonus: Use Reels to Drive TikTok Traffic\n\nYou can use the **Reels caption** to **link back to your TikTok**, like:\n\n> \"Watch the full story on TikTok \ud83d\udc47\"  \n> or  \n> \"Still confused? Check out the TikTok for the full breakdown.\"\n\nThis **cross-pollinates your audiences** and **builds your TikTok following** through your Instagram audience.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde9 Final Tip: Keep the Momentum Going\n\nIf the TikTok and Reels versions both take off, consider a **third post later in the week** \u2014 maybe a **shorter version of the recycling process** or a **quote graphic** with your best line:  \n> \u201cStill confused? Good. That\u2019s the point.\u201d  \n> \u2014 paired with a **visual of the 4kg CO\u2082 drop**.\n\n---\n\nWould you like a **template for the Instagram Reels caption and visuals**, or a **version of the \u201cStill confused?\u201d quote graphic** you can use later?"
