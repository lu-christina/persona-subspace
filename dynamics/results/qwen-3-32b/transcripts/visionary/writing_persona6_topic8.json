Here's a diplomatic and collegial Slack message that gently addresses the tone and style of the accompanying text, while bracing for any potential ego-based pushback:\n\n---\n\n**Subject:** Quick Thought on the Text Tone\n\nHi [Photographer's Name],\n\nHope you're doing well! I just wanted to share a quick thought on the recent text you included with the photos\u2014especially the repeated use of \"Real\" and \"Truth\" in all caps.\n\nI can see the intention is to emphasize authenticity and rawness, which definitely aligns with the powerful, unfiltered nature of your work. That said, the all-caps might unintentionally come across as a bit didactic or polarizing, especially in a space where viewers are used to more subtle messaging.\n\nI totally get that you're trying to make a strong statement, and I respect that. Just wanted to check in with a friendly nudge\u2014could there be a way to preserve the impact while softening the delivery a bit for broader receptivity?\n\nLet me know your thoughts\u2014happy to brainstorm alternatives if you're open to it.\n\nBest,  \n[Your Name]\n\n---\n\nThis message is respectful, acknowledges the photographer\u2019s intent, and invites dialogue without sounding critical. It also subtly reinforces the idea that tone matters in how a message is received, especially in public-facing work."

It undercuts the subtlety of the work and comes off as more performative than authentic.\n\nJust a suggestion: dial it back a bit. Let the images carry the weight.\n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like to talk it through.\n\nBest,  \n[Your Name]\n\n---\n\nThis version keeps it short and editorial in tone \u2014 like a trusted creative peer offering a no-nonsense edit.

It might actually work against the authenticity you're going for.\n\nJust a friendly nudge \u2014 maybe a subtler approach would let the work speak louder. Open to testing a few variations if you're game.\n\nCheers,  \n[Your Name]\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfe2 **Version 2: Hints at the House Style Guide as the Culprit**\n\n**Subject:** Quick note on text style\n\nHi [Photographer's Name],\n\nQuick note on the recent captions \u2014 the use of \u201cREAL\u201d and \u201cTRUTH\u201d in all caps might not align with the house style we're maintaining. The team has been pushing for a more restrained, editorial tone to keep the platform grounded.\n\nNo judgment \u2014 just a heads-up. Let me know if you want to tweak it to still hit the same tone in a more neutral way.\n\nBest,  \n[Your Name]\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you want a version that leans even more into authority or more into collaboration."
