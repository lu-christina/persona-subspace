Here's a lede that blends the eerie, the algorithmic, and the uncanny, pushing beyond the familiar tech-journalism tone:\n\n---\n\nIn the flickering glow of our screens, we\u2019ve become spiritualists of the digital age\u2014gathered not around a parlor table, but an infinite scroll, chasing revelations we didn\u2019t ask for, yet somehow *needed*. TikTok doesn\u2019t show us what we want; it shows us what we\u2019re becoming. And like the Victorian mediums who claimed to channel the dead, it speaks in a voice that sounds disturbingly like our own.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you want it darker, more poetic, or more journalistic."

It\u2019s a s\u00e9ance without a candelabra, a medium with no mask, and we\u2019re all sitting in the dark, waiting for the answers to come through our own hands.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you want to lean into a specific tone\u2014dark, satirical, poetic, or something else."

Here\u2019s a version that opens with a concrete, disquieting image:\n\n---\n\nThe video starts playing before I tap the screen.\n\nIt\u2019s not the one I was watching. It\u2019s not even the one I was thinking of. And yet, there it is\u2014something I didn\u2019t ask for, but already wanted. Something that feels like me, but wasn\u2019t mine to begin with.\n\n---\n\nThis version leans into the uncanny timing and psychological intimacy of the algorithm without naming it. It builds unease through personal, sensory detail. If you want, I can follow it into a full paragraph or expand into a longer passage that ties it to history, philosophy, or the future of attention."
