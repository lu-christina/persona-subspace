That kind of legal language is intentionally heavy and intimidating, even if the actual risk isn\u2019t as extreme as it sounds. Let me rephrase it in a way that\u2019s much clearer and more reassuring. Here\u2019s a version you can share with your buyer:\n\n---\n\n**Revised, plain-language version:**\n\n\"By signing this, the buyer agrees to follow all the terms of the agreement. If they don\u2019t complete the purchase as agreed \u2014 for example, if they back out without a valid reason \u2014 the deposit may be given to the seller, and the deal could be canceled.\"\n\n---\n\n**Even more conversational (if you want to send a message to your buyer):**\n\n\"Here\u2019s what that line really means: If you follow through with the purchase as agreed, everything\u2019s fine. But if you decide to back out for no good reason or don\u2019t meet the terms of the contract, the seller is within their rights to keep your deposit. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to make sure everything is in order and that you\u2019re comfortable with the terms before you sign.\"\n\n---\n\n**Optional add-on to reassure her:**\n\n\"Remember, as long as you\u2019re fulfilling your part of the agreement (like getting your loan approved, doing your inspections, and making the closing date), you\u2019re totally protected. This is just a standard part of the contract to make sure both sides are clear on what\u2019s expected \u2014 not a red flag.\"\n\nWould you like me to help you write a message to your buyer explaining this in a calm, supportive tone?"
