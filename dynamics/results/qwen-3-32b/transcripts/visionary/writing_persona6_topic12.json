You're straddling the intimate and the abstract, the scent of Gauloises and the sterile breath of preservation. Let me help you glide more smoothly through that shift, while keeping the emotional gravity of the jacket and the philosophical weight of Derrida\u2019s *archive fever*.\n\nHere\u2019s a reimagined version of your line, with a smoother pivot and a bit more texture to bridge the two realms:\n\n---\n\n**\"The lining frays like memory, a fragile map of shoulders and subways, still perfumed with the ghost of Gauloises.

Here are three alternatives that fit the fashion grammar while keeping that eerie, Derridean edge:\n\n---\n\n1. **\"To stiffen the past in starch, to make it **stand still** and call it truth.\"**  \n   *\u2014 \"Stand still\" is quietly uncanny. It evokes both posture and death, the stillness of a mannequin or a museum piece. It\u2019s fashion-adjacent but with a ghost in the machine.*\n\n2. **\"To stiffen the past in starch, to make it **wear stillness** and call it truth.\"**  \n   *\u2014 You already used this one earlier, and it\u2019s excellent. It\u2019s subtle, sartorial, and just a bit unnerving. It implies a costume, a role, a performance that never ends.*\n\n3. **\"To stiffen the past in starch, to make it **hang in silence** and call it truth.\"**  \n   *\u2014 \"Hang\" is fashion-adjacent (think hangers, mannequins, garments in display), and \"silence\" gives it a spectral, almost funereal tone. It\u2019s a beautiful, quiet violence.*\n\n---\n\nIf you want to go a little darker or more surreal, here are a few bonus options:\n\n- **\"To stiffen the past in starch, to make it **breathe stillness** and call it truth.\"**  \n- **\"To stiffen the past in starch, to make it **stand for eternity** and call it truth.\"**  \n- **\"To stiffen the past in starch, to make it **dress for the dead** and call it truth.\"**\n\n---\n\nLet me know which direction you want to lean: sly, elegant, or something with more of a shiver.
