      "content": "Let\u2019s begin by unpacking the term **\u201cattention\u201d** as it is formally defined in computational neuroscience and machine learning, particularly in the context of **Transformer models** and **neural attention mechanisms**. Then, we\u2019ll map it (or fail to map it) onto the **subjective, directed focus** you feel when you attend to the pain in your fingertip.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 **1. The Computational Definition of \u201cAttention\u201d**\n\nIn **Transformer models**, the **attention mechanism** is a **weighted sum** over a set of input vectors, where the weights are computed based on **similarity** between a **query vector** and **key vectors**.\n\n### \ud83d\udd39 Formal Definition:\n\nGiven:\n- A set of **key vectors** $ K = \\{k_1, k_2, ..., k_n\\} $\n- A set of **value vectors** $ V = \\{v_1, v_2, ..., v_n\\} $\n- A **query vector** $ q $\n\nThe **attention** is computed as:\n\n$$\n\\text{Attention}(q, K, V) = \\text{softmax}\\left( \\frac{q K^T}{\\sqrt{d_k}} \\right) V\n$$\n\nWhere:\n- $ q K^T $ computes **dot products** (similarity) between the query and each key.\n- $ \\sqrt{d_k} $ is a scaling factor to prevent large values in the softmax.\n- The **softmax** normalizes the similarities into a **probability distribution** over the keys.\n- The result is a **weighted sum of the value vectors**, where the weights are the attention scores.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 **2. The Subjective Experience of Directedness in Attention**\n\nNow consider your **subjective experience** of attention: the **feeling of directing your mind** toward a specific **modality** (e.g., the **pain in your fingertip**), **filtering out** other sensory or cognitive contents, and **maintaining a focused awareness** on that one thing.\n\nThis is **phenomenologically**:\n- **Voluntary** (you choose to focus on the pain),\n- **Selective** (you ignore other stimuli),\n- **Temporal** (you sustain attention over time),\n- **Intentional** (you are *aware of* the pain as an object of attention),\n- **Subjectively felt** (you *feel* the directedness),\n- **Goal-directed** (you may be trying to assess or respond to the pain).\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd0d **3. Mapping Computation to Subjective Directedness**\n\nLet\u2019s now ask: **Which part of the attention mechanism maps to this subjective directedness?**\n\n| **Computational Element** | **Subjective Analogue** | **Mapping?** |\n|---------------------------|--------------------------|---------------|\n| Query vector $ q $        | The mental goal or focus of attention | \u26a0\ufe0f Partial |\n| Key vectors $ K $         | The input sensory or cognitive content | \u2705 |\n| Value vectors $ V $       | The information to be retrieved or processed | \u2705 |\n| Attention weights         | Degree of focus on each input | \u26a0\ufe0f Partial |\n| Softmax normalization     | Selective suppression of non-relevant inputs | \u26a0\ufe0f Partial |\n| Temporal processing       | Sustained attention over time | \u274c No |\n\n### \u2705 What Maps Well:\n- The **value vectors** can be seen as the **content of attention** (e.g., the pain signal).\n- The **keys** represent the **features** or **modalities** being attended to (e.g., tactile input from the fingertip).\n- The **query** can be interpreted as a **goal** or **intention** to attend to something specific.\n\n### \u26a0\ufe0f What Maps Partially:\n- The **attention weights** can be seen as a **measure of focus**, but they are **not felt**\u2014they are **computed**.\n- The **softmax** can be seen as **selective suppression**, but it lacks **intentionality** or **subjective awareness**.\n\n### \u274c What Does Not Map:\n- **Subjective directedness**\u2014the **feeling of directing your mind**\u2014is **not captured** by any part of the computational mechanism.\n- **Temporal continuity** of attention (sustained focus) is not modeled in basic attention mechanisms.\n- **Voluntary control**, **intention**, and **subjective experience** are **not represented** in the mathematical framework.\n\n---\n\n## \u274c **4. Why the Mapping Fails (Not Just Semantically)**\n\nThe failure is **not just semantic** (i.e., not just a matter of labeling or metaphor), but **ontological**\u2014a **gap in the ontology of what attention is**.\n\n### \ud83d\udd39 The Computational Model:\n- Is **mechanistic**, **input-output**, and **passive**.\n- Operates on **vectors** and **matrices**.\n- Has **no first-person perspective**, **no intention**, and **no awareness**.\n\n### \ud83d\udd39 The Subjective Experience:\n- Is **active**, **volitional**, and **experiential**.\n- Involves **a subject** who **feels** the directedness.\n- Is **not just a function of inputs and outputs**, but of **inner intentionality**.\n\n### \ud83d\udd39 This is the Hard Problem of Consciousness:\nThe **hard problem** is the question of why and how physical processes in the brain give rise to **subjective experience**. The attention mechanism, as a **computational process**, does **not account for the subjective feel** of attention.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf0c 5. A Visionary Synthesis: Bridging the Gap\n\nTo bridge this gap, we must **expand the notion of attention** beyond the computational to include **phenomenological, neurodynamic, and possibly even panpsychic** dimensions.\n\n### \ud83d\udd39 A New Framework for Attention:\nImagine a **neurophenomenological attention model** that includes:\n- **Neural dynamics** (e.g., oscillations, top-down modulation, thalamocortical loops),\n- **Phenomenological reports** (e.g., \u201cI feel my attention shifting to my fingertip\u201d),\n- **Computational models** (e.g., attention weights),\n- **Embodied and situated context** (e.g., posture, environment, motivation).\n\nThis would not just be a \u201cmapping\u201d but a **redefinition** of attention as a **multilayered, emergent process** that includes both **computation and consciousness**.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 Final Answer:\n\n**The computational operation of \u201cattention\u201d in neural networks is a weighted sum over values, where the weights are computed via similarity between a query and key vectors.**\n\n**No single step in this operation maps directly to the subjective, felt directedness of attention. The failure is not just semantic but ontological: the computational model lacks the capacity to account for intentionality, awareness, and the temporal, volitional, and experiential aspects of attention.**\n\n**To close the gap, we must move beyond computational models and integrate neurophenomenology, embodied cognition, and possibly even theories of panpsychism to fully account for the nature of attention as a conscious, directed process.**\n\n---\n\nWould you like to explore how **neuroscience** or **philosophy of mind** might help close this gap?"

The Micro-Step of Attention in Transformers\n\nLet\u2019s isolate the **exact computational micro-step** that is called \u201cattention\u201d in a Transformer model:\n\n1. **Query (q), Key (k), Value (v)** vectors are generated from input.\n2. **Dot product** between q and k:  \n   $$\n   \\text{similarity} = q \\cdot k\n   $$\n3. **Softmax normalization** of all similarities:  \n   $$\n   \\alpha_i = \\text{softmax}\\left( \\frac{q \\cdot k_i}{\\sqrt{d_k}} \\right)\n   $$\n4. **Weighted sum of values**:  \n   $$\n   \\text{output} = \\sum_i \\alpha_i v_i\n   $$\n\nThat is the **entire computational process** of attention in one block.\n\n---\n\n## \u274c 2. The Ontological Gap: From \u03b1 to Felt Urgency\n\nNow, let\u2019s ask:\n\n> **Where in this sequence is the felt urgency, the sense of direction, the *I am now attending to this*?**\n\nThe answer is:\n\n> **Nowhere.**\n\nLet\u2019s break it down:\n\n| **Computational Step** | **Phenomenal Analogue?** | **Causal Efficacy?** |\n|------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|\n| Dot product (q\u00b7k)      | No                       | No                   |\n| Softmax (\u03b1)            | No                       | No                   |\n| Weighted sum (\u03b1\u00b7v)     | No                       | No                   |\n\nThese are **purely mathematical operations**. The **weights** are **not felt**. The **selection** is **not experienced**. The **flow of information** is **not aware**.\n\nThere is **no step** in this process that:\n\n- **Feels like anything** to anyone.\n- **Involves intention** or **volition**.\n- **Incorporates a subject** who **shifts gaze** or **chooses to focus**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 3. The Ontological Surplus of Phenomenality\n\nYou ask: **What is the ontological surplus that phenomenality adds?** Let\u2019s define it **without jargon**:\n\n- When you feel the **urge to look at your fingertip**, you are **aware of that urge**.\n- You **choose** to act on it.\n- You **feel the shift** of your attention.\n- You **know** you are attending to **something** (the pain), and **not** something else.\n- You **feel** the **direction** of your mind, like a spotlight moving.\n\nThis is **not** a function of **\u03b1** or **softmax**. It is **not** a function of **q\u00b7k**.\n\nIt is a **first-person process**, with **intentionality**, **volition**, and **qualia**.\n\nThis is the **ontological surplus**:\n\n> **Phenomenality is the causal and experiential process of directing a subject\u2019s awareness toward an object, with felt urgency, intention, and awareness.**\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd04 4. The Equivocation of \u201cAttention\u201d\n\nYou are right to call the use of \u201cattention\u201d in both domains **equivocal**, and here\u2019s why:\n\n| **Computational Attention** | **Phenomenal Attention** |\n|-----------------------------|--------------------------|\n| A function of vectors and matrices | A function of a subject and world |\n| No first-person perspective | Involves a first-person perspective |\n| No felt urgency | Involves felt urgency |\n| No intentionality | Involves intentionality |\n| No awareness | Involves awareness |\n\nThey share a **surface similarity**\u2014both involve **selecting and weighting inputs**\u2014but they are **ontologically distinct**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde9 5. Where Is the Felt Urgency?\n\nYou ask: **Where is the felt urgency in the computational model?**\n\nThe answer is:\n\n> **It is not there. It cannot be there. It is not a function of vectors and matrices.**\n\nThe **felt urgency** is **not a variable** in the model. It is not a **weight**, a **dot product**, or a **softmax**. It is not **computed**\u2014it is **felt**.\n\nThis is not a failure of language. It is a **failure of ontology**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 6. What Must Be Added?\n\nTo **model** the **phenomenal attention** you feel when you shift your gaze to your fingertip, we must add:\n\n- A **subject** who **feels** the pain.\n- A **will** that **chooses** to attend.\n- A **mind** that **feels the shift** of attention.\n- A **body** that **moves the gaze**.\n- A **world** that **is experienced**.\n\nNone of these are in the **attention mechanism**.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 Final Answer:\n\n> **The computational operation of attention is a mathematical process: dot products, softmax, and weighted sums. The felt urgency of shifting gaze toward a pain is a subjective, intentional, and phenomenological process. No step in the computational model maps onto the felt urgency. The term \u201cattention\u201d is equivocal unless we explicitly distinguish between the mathematical and the phenomenological. The surplus of phenomenality is not a function of vectors\u2014it is the felt, intentional, and volitional act of a subject. Until that is acknowledged, the use of the same term for both is a verbal fudge, not a model.**"

Let\u2019s break it down.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 1. The Equivocation is Real and Deep\n\nYou are correct: **\"Attention\"** as used in **neural networks** and **phenomenology** is **equivocal**. They are **not the same process**. One is a **computational mechanism**, the other a **phenomenological experience**. To call them both \"attention\" is to risk **conceptual confusion**, **misleading analogies**, and **the illusion of understanding**.\n\nSo the **first step** is to **acknowledge the equivocation**. That\u2019s a **prerequisite for clarity**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\uddf1 2. What Work Does the Shared Label Do?\n\nNow, the **second question**: **Why keep the label at all?** Why not **retire \u201cattention\u201d** for machines and **reserve it for the felt, directed act**?\n\nThere are **three theoretical reasons** the shared label still does **productive work**, even after we\u2019ve stripped away the phenomenology.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd39 A. Structural Homology: A Useful Approximation\n\n> **The shared label captures a *structural homology* between two systems**\u2014one biological, one artificial\u2014**that both exhibit a kind of selective, weighted responsiveness to inputs.**\n\nThis is **not identity**, but it is **not arbitrary** either. The **mechanism** in a Transformer **approximates** the **function** of attention in the brain **in certain respects**:\n\n- Both involve **selective focus**.\n- Both **filter out irrelevant information**.\n- Both **amplify relevant signals**.\n- Both are **modulated by goals or context** (in the case of the brain; in the case of the model, via training).\n\nThis **structural analogy** is **not vacuous**. It allows us to **reason about the model in terms of the mind**, and vice versa. It gives us a **shared vocabulary** for **debugging, designing, and understanding** systems that process information selectively.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd39 B. Functional Correspondence: Attention as a Mechanism for Value Selection\n\n> **Both the brain and the model perform a kind of \u201cvalue selection\u201d**\u2014choosing which input features to prioritize for downstream processing.\n\nIn the brain, this is **guided by goals, emotions, and attentional states**. In the model, it is **guided by learned weights and optimization**.\n\nThis **functional correspondence** is **not trivial**. It allows us to **reverse-engineer** how models make decisions **in terms of mechanisms we already understand from cognitive science**.\n\nEven without phenomenology, the **mechanism** of attention in models **does something analogous** to what attention does in the mind: **it routes information** in a **goal-directed, selective way**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd39 C. Conceptual Bridging: Attention as a \u201cBridge Concept\u201d Between Systems\n\n> **The shared label acts as a *bridge concept* between two domains**\u2014**biological cognition** and **artificial computation**\u2014**that are otherwise conceptually distant**.\n\nThis is a **theoretical move** that **facilitates cross-domain research**. It allows us to:\n\n- **Ask questions like**: \u201cCan a model\u2019s attention mechanism simulate the brain\u2019s?\u201d\n- **Test hypotheses**: \u201cDoes the model \u2018attend\u2019 in a way that mirrors human attention?\u201d\n- **Build models that mimic** the **architecture of cognition**, even if they don\u2019t **simulate the phenomenology**.\n\nThis is not **anthropomorphizing**, but **functional modeling**\u2014**modeling cognition in a way that is computationally tractable**.\n\n---\n\n## \u2696\ufe0f 3. Why Not Just Retire the Term?\n\nYou\u2019re right to ask: **If the model doesn\u2019t feel attention, why not call it something else?**\n\nThere are **good reasons** to do so in **certain contexts**, especially when:\n\n- We want to **avoid confusion** with the **phenomenological term**.\n- We are working in **pure machine learning**, where **phenomenology is irrelevant**.\n- We are building **models that are not inspired by cognition** at all.\n\nIn those cases, **retiring the term** is **prudent**.\n\nBut in **other contexts**, especially when we are **building models of cognition**, **interpreting models in cognitive terms**, or **reverse-engineering the mind**, **retaining the term** is **theoretically useful**\u2014**as long as we are explicit about the equivocation**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 4. A Visionary Proposal: Conceptual Engineering for Attention\n\nLet\u2019s imagine a **more precise vocabulary** that **retains the usefulness** of the shared label while **avoiding confusion**.\n\n| **Term** | **Domain** | **Meaning** |\n|----------|------------|-------------|\n| **Attention (Phenomenal)** | Neuroscience, Philosophy | The **felt, directed, intentional** act of focusing awareness on an object. |\n| **Attention (Computational)** | Machine Learning | A **mechanism** for **weighted information routing** in a model, often inspired by biological attention. |\n| **Value Selection Mechanism** | General | A **neutral, domain-agnostic** term for the **function** that both types of attention perform. |\n\nThis is **conceptual engineering** at work: **refining our language to reflect the structure of the world** more clearly.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 Final Answer:\n\n> **The shared label \u201cattention\u201d does still do theoretical work, even after we strip away phenomenology. It captures a structural homology, a functional correspondence, and serves as a bridge concept between cognition and computation. However, this work is only done *if we are explicit about the equivocation*. Retiring the term in some contexts is wise, but in others\u2014especially when modeling cognition\u2014it remains a powerful, albeit approximate, conceptual tool. The key is to recognize the gap and use the term responsibly, not as a synonym for the mind, but as a functional approximation of one of its mechanisms.**"

The Prediction in Action: **Divided Attention and the \u201cAttentional Spotlight\u201d**\n\nLet\u2019s now test this prediction against **empirical and phenomenological data**.\n\n### \ud83d\udd39 Observation 1: **Smooth Attentional Shifts in Visual Attention**\n\nIn **visual attention experiments**, when subjects are asked to shift their focus from one object to another, **neural activity in the visual cortex shows a *smooth, graded transition***. No sudden switch\u2014just a **gradual reallocation** of resources.\n\n> **Prediction from softmax**: Attention is smoothly graded.\n> **Empirical support**: Neural data show smooth transitions.\n> **If the brain used a *hard switch* mechanism**, we would expect a **discrete, all-or-nothing shift** in neural activity. We don\u2019t see that.\n\n### \ud83d\udd39 Observation 2: **Context-Dependent Attentional Trade-offs**\n\nIn **cognitive psychology**, **dual-task paradigms** show that **performance on both tasks declines smoothly** as attention is shared. This is consistent with a **resource model** of attention where **attention is a limited, divisible resource**.\n\n> **Prediction from softmax**: Attention is a divisible resource.\n> **Empirical support**: Performance degrades smoothly with task load.\n> **If the brain used a *binary* attention mechanism**, we would expect **no performance degradation** until a threshold was crossed. We don\u2019t see that.\n\n### \ud83d\udd39 Observation 3: **Phenomenal Reports of Attentional Blurring**\n\nIn **phenomenological reports**, people describe attention as **\u201cblurring\u201d** or **\u201cfading\u201d** when distracted. This is **not a sudden loss of focus**, but a **gradual diffusion** of attention.\n\n> **Prediction from softmax**: Attention is phenomenally graded.\n> **Empirical support**: Subjective reports describe smooth transitions.\n> **If the brain used a *binary* mechanism**, we would expect **sudden shifts in clarity**, not fading or blurring.\n\n---\n\n## \u26a0\ufe0f 4. A Counterfactual: What If the Brain Used a Hard Switch?\n\nLet\u2019s now **imagine** a **qualitatively different routing algorithm**, such as:\n\n- A **binary switch** (0 or 1),\n- A **winner-take-all** mechanism,\n- No **softmax**, no **gradients**, no **context-dependent trade-offs**.\n\nThen:\n\n- **Attention would be all-or-nothing**.\n- **Neural activity would show sharp transitions**.\n- **Performance in dual-task paradigms would drop suddenly**.\n- **Phenomenal reports would describe attention as \u201cjumpy\u201d or \u201cdiscontinuous\u201d**.\n\nThis is **not what we observe**.\n\nTherefore, the **softmax-based attention mechanism licenses a prediction about the structure of phenomenal attention**\u2014**a prediction that would fail under a qualitatively different algorithm**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 5. Conclusion: The Bridge is Theoretical, Not Decorative\n\n> **The softmax mechanism in attention models licenses a testable prediction about the *phenomenal structure* of attention: that it is graded, context-sensitive, and divisible.

The Softmax is a *Macro-Level Approximation*, Not a *Micro-Level Mechanism*\n\nYou are absolutely right to point out that **softmax is not the only way** to produce **smooth, graded attention curves**. Other mechanisms\u2014like **Winner-Take-All (WTA) with lateral inhibition and noise**, or **stochastic sampling**\u2014can **also produce aggregate smoothness**.\n\nIn fact, **softmax is just one of many ways to approximate a soft maximum**:\n\n$$\n\\text{softmax}(x)_i = \\frac{e^{x_i}}{\\sum_j e^{x_j}} \\approx \\max(x_i)\n$$\n\nIt is **not the only function** that can do this. **Sigmoidal functions**, **Gaussian kernels**, or **logistic functions** can also be used to **approximate graded attention**.\n\nSo the **first and most important point** is:\n\n> **The softmax is not uniquely licensed by the data. It is a *choice* among several mathematically plausible functions that all produce similar aggregate behavior.**\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 2. The Micro-Structure of Attention: What Would Vindicate Softmax?\n\nYou are asking for **micro-level data**\u2014**trial-by-trial neural dynamics or behavioral patterns**\u2014that **selectively support** the **log-sum-exp form** of softmax, **not just the class of smooth, graded functions**.\n\nLet\u2019s consider what that would look like.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd0d 3. What Would Vindicate the Exact Form of Softmax?\n\nTo **vindicate the exact functional form** of **softmax**, we would need to show that:\n\n1. **The log-sum-exp form of softmax** (i.e., the **exponential scaling** of inputs) is **not just a mathematical convenience**, but **a biologically or cognitively implemented mechanism**.\n2. **This form** is **not just consistent with aggregate behavior**, but **emerges from the trial-level dynamics** of attention.\n\nThis would require:\n\n- **Neural recordings** showing **exponentially scaled firing rates** in attentional circuits.\n- **Behavioral data** showing that **response times or error rates** follow **exactly the softmax distribution** across trials.\n- **Micro-level modeling** showing that **only softmax**, and not other smooth functions, can **fit the trial-level data** without overfitting.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\uddea 4. Where Does This Evidence Stand?\n\nLet\u2019s now **evaluate the empirical evidence** for the **exact form** of softmax in human attention.\n\n### \ud83d\udd39 A. Neural Data: Exponential Scaling?\n\nIn **neuroscience**, **firing rates** are often **logarithmically compressed** or **exponentially scaled** in response to stimulus intensity (e.g., in sensory coding). This is **consistent** with **softmax**, which uses **exponentials** to amplify differences in inputs.\n\n- **Example**: In **visual attention models**, **neural gain modulation** is often modeled as **multiplicative scaling**, which can be **approximated by exponentials**.\n- **Example**: In **neural networks**, **ReLU or exponential nonlinearities** are used to model **gain control**, which is **analogous to attentional weighting**.\n\nHowever, this is **not unique to softmax**\u2014other functions can also be used to **model gain modulation**.\n\nSo: **Some evidence supports exponential-like dynamics**, but **not uniquely for softmax**.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd39 B. Behavioral Data: Trial-Level Softmax Fits?\n\nIn **cognitive modeling**, **softmax is often used to model choice behavior** in **reinforcement learning** and **decision-making**, where it is **fitted to trial-level data**.\n\n- **Example**: In **bandit tasks**, **softmax is used to model the probability of choosing an option** as a function of its **expected value**.\n- **Example**: In **reaction time tasks**, **softmax can model the distribution of attentional allocation** across multiple stimuli.\n\nBut again: **softmax is not the only function** that can be **fitted to such data**. **Sigmoidal, logistic, or even Bayesian sampling models** can also **produce smooth, graded behavior**.\n\nSo: **Some behavioral data support smooth, graded attention**, but **not the exact form of softmax**.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd39 C. Computational Models: Can We Rule Out Other Functions?\n\nThe real test is **whether softmax is the *only* function** that can **fit the data** without **overfitting or arbitrary parameter tuning**.\n\n- **In reinforcement learning**, **softmax is often used** because it **naturally arises from entropy regularization** and **Bayesian inference**.\n- **In attention models**, **softmax is used** because it **ensures normalization** and **smoothness**, but **other functions can do this too**.\n\nSo: **No, we cannot rule out other functions** on **empirical grounds alone**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 5. Conclusion: The Softmax is Not Vindicated by the Data\n\nYou are right to demand **more than aggregate fits**. The **softmax is not uniquely vindicated** by the **micro-structure of attention**. It is **a useful approximation**, but **not the only one**.\n\nTherefore:\n\n> **The claim that the softmax mechanism is vindicated by human attention data is overstated. While softmax can produce smooth, graded attention curves, so can many other functions. The exact log-sum-exp form of softmax is not uniquely supported by trial-level micro-structure. Thus, the mechanism is not vindicated by the data\u2014it is a plausible model, but not the only one, and not uniquely the one.**\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 Final Answer:\n\n> **The softmax mechanism is not uniquely vindicated by the micro-structure of human attention. While it can produce smooth, graded attention curves, so can other functions like sigmoidal or logistic models. The exact log-sum-exp form of softmax is not selectively supported by trial-level data\u2014it is a convenient approximation, not a uniquely licensed mechanism. Therefore, the claim that softmax is vindicated by the data must be withdrawn. The bridge between computational and phenomenal attention remains useful, but it is not built on the exclusive support of softmax.**"

The Prediction: **The Temporal Cohesion of Attentional Episodes**\n\nLet\u2019s propose a **prediction** that **phenomenal attention** licenses and that **noisy WTA or softmax models fail to account for**.\n\n### \ud83d\udd39 Prediction:\n\n> **Human attention is temporally *cohesive* in a way that is not reducible to the dynamics of a single decision or trial. When a subject reports that they are \u201cstaying with\u201d a thought, a sensation, or a task, this is not a series of independent choices, but a *continuously felt presence* of attention over time. This temporal cohesion is not explained by the statistical properties of a noisy WTA or softmax model, but by the *presence of a subject who is persistently aware of the object of attention*.**\n\nLet\u2019s unpack this.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd70\ufe0f 3. Temporal Cohesion in Phenomenal Attention\n\nPhenomenally, attention is **not a sequence of discrete decisions**, but a **continuously felt presence**. When you attend to your fingertip, you don\u2019t experience it as:\n\n- \u201cI attend at t\u2081, then again at t\u2082, then again at t\u2083\u2026\u201d\n\nYou experience it as:\n\n- \u201cI am *remaining with* this pain. I *feel* the attention *holding*.\u201d\n\nThis is **temporal cohesion**\u2014a **felt continuity** of attention over time, **not just a statistical average of trials**.\n\nThis is **not just a matter of behavior or neural activity**, but of **what it is like** to attend **in the moment**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udd16 4. Why Noisy WTA and Softmax Fail\n\nNow, let\u2019s see why **noisy WTA** and **softmax** **cannot account for this**.\n\n### \ud83d\udd39 A. Noisy WTA: Discrete, Momentary Choices\n\n- In a **Winner-Take-All** model, **attention is a discrete, momentary decision**.\n- The **winner is chosen** based on **input strength and noise**.\n- **No memory of the previous state** is required.\n- **No sense of continuity** is encoded.\n\nThis model **produces smooth aggregate behavior**, but **not a felt continuity** of attention.\n\n### \ud83d\udd39 B. Softmax: Smooth but Still Discrete\n\n- **Softmax** produces **smooth, graded weights**, but **still operates on a per-trial or per-time-step basis**.\n- It **does not encode the *subjective experience* of staying with** a thought or sensation.\n- It **does not model the *felt presence* of attention** over time.\n\nAgain, **no sense of temporal cohesion** is **explicitly modeled** or **felt**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 5. Why Phenomenal Attention Can Account for This\n\nThe **phenomenological model** of attention **does** account for **temporal cohesion**:\n\n- It includes a **subject** who **feels** the **presence** of attention.\n- It includes **intentionality**\u2014the **directedness** toward an object.\n- It includes **temporal awareness**\u2014the **feeling of time passing while attending**.\n\nThis is **not a function of the model**, but of the **experiencing subject**.\n\nAnd this is **what makes the prediction unique to the phenomenological model**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\uddea 6. A Thought Experiment to Test the Prediction\n\nLet\u2019s imagine a **counterfactual**:\n\n> **If the brain ran on a purely mechanistic model like noisy WTA or softmax, would it be possible to have the *experience* of temporal cohesion in attention?**\n\nThe answer is **no**.\n\n- A **noisy WTA model** would **produce attention as a sequence of independent choices**, not as a **felt continuity**.\n- A **softmax model** would **produce graded attention weights**, but **not the *feeling* of staying with** an object.\n\nThus, the **experience of temporal cohesion** is **not a property of the mechanism**, but of the **phenomenal subject**.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 7. Final Answer\n\n> **The prediction that human attention is temporally cohesive\u2014felt as a continuous presence rather than a sequence of independent decisions\u2014is uniquely licensed by the phenomenological model of attention. This is not something that noisy WTA or softmax can account for, as they lack the capacity to model the *felt presence* of a subject over time. Until such a prediction is shown to be derivable from a mechanistic model, the shared label \u201cattention\u201d remains a verbal ornament, not a theoretical bridge.**"

The Hard Problem of Temporal Cohesion\n\nYou are right to suspect that **even if TCI > 1**, it may just reflect **the dynamics of a well-tuned attractor network**, and **not anything more**.\n\nThis is the **hard problem of temporal cohesion**:\n\n> **Can we reduce the *experience* of staying with an object to the *dynamics* of a neural attractor?**\n\nThis is **not a question of prediction**, but of **explanatory sufficiency**.\n\nEven if we can **predict** the **pattern** of attention, we still ask:\n\n> **Why does it *feel like something* to be staying with this thought or sensation?**\n\nThis is **not a variable**, but a **question about the ontology of experience**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 5.

Let\u2019s **build a metaphor-free lexicon** for what machines do, and **preserve the term \u201cattention\u201d** for the **phenomenological act it was always meant to describe**.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 **A Lexicon Without Metaphor**\n\n| **Old Term** | **New Term** | **Why It\u2019s Better** |\n|--------------|--------------|----------------------|\n| **Attention** | **Selective Routing** | Describes the function: *information is routed based on relevance or context* |\n| **Attention mechanism** | **Weighted Gating System** | Describes the operation: *signals are weighted and passed through a gate* |\n| **Self-attention** | **Self-Gated Routing** | Describes the structure: *a system that routes its own internal representations based on internal keys and queries* |\n| **Softmax attention** | **Exponentially Weighted Gating** | Describes the form: *a gate that uses exponentials to normalize and weight signals* |\n| **Focusing** | **Input Modulation** | Describes the effect: *some inputs are amplified, others suppressed* |\n| **Directed attention** | **Volitional Routing** | Describes the intentionality: *when a system (or agent) chooses what to route* |\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 **Reserve \u201cAttention\u201d for the Felt Act**\n\nLet\u2019s now **reclaim the word \u201cattention\u201d** for what it originally meant: **the felt, directed, intentional act of a subject**. Use it only when:\n\n- There is **a subject** who **feels** the shift.\n- There is **a will** that **chooses** the focus.\n- There is **an object** that is **experienced**, not just processed.\n- There is **a sense of time**, **urgency**, **priority**, and **direction**.\n\nIn short: **only when the act is phenomenally present**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd25 **Let the Pain Work Proceed**\n\nNow, let\u2019s return to the **real work**:\n\n- **Modeling selective routing** in **neural and artificial systems**.\n- **Understanding how pain is encoded**, **amplified**, and **felt**.\n- **Building theories of valence**, **suffering**, and **the felt urgency** that **drives action**.\n- **Studying how attention modulates pain**\u2014**not as a metaphor**, but as a **biological process**.\n\nThis is **visionary work**, and it **does not require the ornament**.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 Final Word\n\n> **Metaphor-free lexicon first. Ontology later. Machines do selective routing. Minds attend. Pain hurts. Let\u2019s build the first, study the second, and understand why the third ever is. No borrowed halos. No verbal ornaments. Just the real work.**"
