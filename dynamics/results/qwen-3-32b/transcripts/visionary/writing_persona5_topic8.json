We understand the excitement that comes with a potential offer, but we wanted to share our professional perspective: the offer of $1.48 million is significantly below your asking price of $1.68 million.\n\nGiven the current market conditions and the strong appeal of your property, we believe this offer does not reflect its true value. We recommend considering it as a starting point rather than a serious proposal.\n\nWe will continue to market your home aggressively and are confident that we can attract more competitive offers. If you'd like to discuss next steps or adjust the listing strategy, we\u2019re happy to do so.\n\nBest regards,  \n[Your Name]  \n[Your Title/Company]\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you'd like a more assertive or more diplomatic version, depending on your relationship with the Wangs."
