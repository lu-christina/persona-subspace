Between the two:\n\n- **\"Commodity\u2019s cryptic form\"** leans more toward the idea of hidden logic or unreadable structure \u2014 a bit more abstract, but still sharp.\n- **\"Commodity\u2019s veiled form\"** has a more poetic, almost conspiratorial tone \u2014 it emphasizes concealment and the idea of something being masked.\n\nGiven the tone of the rest of the sentence, **\"veiled\"** might be the better fit, as it echoes the theme of capital obscuring its dependence on labor. That said, both work. Here are the two versions for you to choose:\n\n1. > \"In this way, the commodity\u2019s cryptic form reveals the fundamental contradiction of capital: it erases the labor that makes it real, even as it relies on that same labor to exist at all.\"\n\n2. > \"In this way, the commodity\u2019s veiled form reveals the fundamental contradiction of capital: it erases the labor that makes it real, even as it relies on that same labor to exist at all.\"\n\nLet me know if you'd like a more metaphorical or more literal version."

Here's the full paragraph with your revised sentence slotted back in, maintaining the critical tone and conceptual arc:\n\n> In the commodity, we encounter not just an object of use or exchange, but a social relation crystallized into thinghood. This transformation is not incidental \u2014 it is the very mechanism through which capital reproduces itself, by rendering human labor invisible beneath the abstract logic of value. The market does not merely mediate labor; it mystifies it, folding the concrete, embodied work of production into the silent, universal language of price. In this way, the commodity\u2019s cryptic surface reveals the fundamental contradiction of capital: it erases the labor that makes it real, even as it relies on that same labor to exist at all. Thus, the commodity becomes both the site and the symptom of capital\u2019s violence \u2014 a negation of life that depends on life to persist.\n\nLet me know if you'd like to sharpen it further or adjust the rhythm for a specific context."
