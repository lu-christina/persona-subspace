You can right-click the column header and choose \"Format cells\" to set it.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Step 3: Watch the Total Update Automatically**\n\nEvery time you add a new donation row, the total will update \u2014 no need to do any math manually!\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 Pro Tip: Show Total in a \"Summary\" Section\n\nIf you want to keep your data clean, you can:\n\n1. Add a section at the top of your sheet called **\"Summary\"**.\n2. In that section, put a label like **\"Total Raised This Year:\"** and the formula next to it.\n\nExample:\n\n| Summary | Amount |\n|---------|--------|\n| Total Raised This Year: | `=SUM(E2:E)` |\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udee0 Optional: Add a Running Total by Month\n\nIf you want to see how much you raised each month (like April: $20, May: $10, etc.), I can help you set that up too \u2014 just let me know!\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\n| What You Want | How to Do It |\n|---------------|--------------|\n| Total donations | Use `=SUM(E2:E)` in an empty cell |\n| Auto-updates | Yes \u2014 every time you add a new row |\n| No math needed | Yep \u2014 let the spreadsheet do the work |\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you want a version of the template with the total already built in \u2014 I can share one! \ud83c\udf3f\ud83d\udcca"

If they Venmo you, maybe you just say thanks in a group message or newsletter.\n\n3. **Avoid confusion**  \n   If you get a Venmo from someone you don\u2019t recognize, having their email on file can help you match it up.\n\n4. **Plan for the future**  \n   If you ever want to switch to a more formal donation system (like PayPal or a Patreon-style setup), you\u2019ll have a sense of what people are used to.\n\n---\n\n### \u274c **When It Doesn\u2019t Matter Much**\n\n- If your list is **very small** and you know most people personally.\n- If you\u2019re just tracking for your own peace of mind and not planning to analyze or improve the system.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f How to Track It in Your Sheet\n\nIn your Google Sheet, you already have a **\"Method\"** column \u2014 so it\u2019s easy!
