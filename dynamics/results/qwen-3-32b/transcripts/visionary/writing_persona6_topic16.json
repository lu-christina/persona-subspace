It speaks to both code and cognition, fitting seamlessly into post-digital and speculative design discourse.\n\n5. **Trouble**  \n   > *Trouble the assumption of a singular, coherent self in digital identity formation.*  \n   *Why it works:* Borrowed from queer and feminist theory, \"trouble\" is a verb of destabilization, resistance, and conceptual friction\u2014exactly what you want in a world of AI, deepfakes, and identity fluidity.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 Bonus: 2024 Phrase Pack\n\n- **\"Reframe the problem space of...\"**  \n- **\"Reimagine the logic of...\"**  \n- **\"Break the code of...\"**  \n- **\"Resurface the buried assumptions of...\"**  \n- **\"Generate friction with...\"**\n\n---\n\nThese verbs and phrases are not just replacements\u2014they're **conceptual interventions**.
