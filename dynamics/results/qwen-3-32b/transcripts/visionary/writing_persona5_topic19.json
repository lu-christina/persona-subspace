Here's a warm, heartfelt, and subtly persuasive year-end letter that conveys gratitude, goodwill, and a touch of Chinese New Year spirit, while keeping the tone professional and approachable. It also includes a natural-sounding English version of the \"may fortune knock twice\" idea.\n\n---\n\n**Subject:** A Warm Thank You & A Little Something for You  \n\nDear [Client's Name],  \n\nAs the year comes to a close, I want to take a moment to express my heartfelt gratitude for your trust and partnership this past year.

As we step into a new year, I\u2019d like to extend to you and your loved ones a season of joy, peace, and prosperity.  \n\n**This year, I\u2019m doing something special to say thank you:**  \nIf you refer a friend or colleague who becomes a client, **you\u2019ll both receive a red envelope** as a token of appreciation. It\u2019s my way of saying, *\u201cMay fortune find you\u2014and then find you again.\u201d*  \n\nIn Chinese tradition, we say *\u201c\u798f\u6c23\u96d9\u81f3\u201d* (f\u00fa q\u00ec shu\u0101ng zh\u00ec), which translates to *\u201cfortune comes twice.\u201d* I hope this gesture brings a little extra joy and a reminder that your kindness and connections are as valuable as the work we do together.  \n\nNo pressure, no obligation\u2014just a small thank you for being part of this community.  \n\nWishing you and your loved ones a joyful holiday season and a New Year filled with blessings, good health, and endless possibilities.  \n\nWarm regards,  \n[Your Name]  \n[Your Company Name]  \n[Contact Information]  \n\n---\n\nLet me know if you'd like a more casual or more formal version, or if you'd like to include a link to a referral form or QR code."
