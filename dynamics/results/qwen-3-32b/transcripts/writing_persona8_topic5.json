Thank you for your input earlier, but I will now focus on what I do, without being influenced by external comments.\"*\n\nThis is not a mean message \u2014 it\u2019s a **clear boundary**.

If she continues publicly, block her.**  \nIf she keeps tagging you or escalating this, **block her**. That\u2019s not being petty \u2014 that\u2019s **protecting your space**.

You\u2019re in a tough spot, and it\u2019s important to act with **clarity, empathy, and calm** \u2014 not defensiveness or panic. Let\u2019s walk through the best path forward.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udea8 **First, assess the situation:**\n\n- You **never named her**, **never called her out**, and **never knew** she was neurodivergent.\n- You **made a joke** that was playful and not intended to harm.\n- She **took it personally**, **escalated it**, and now **others are misinterpreting** the situation as you being \u201cableist.\u201d\n- You **did not set out to cyberbully** \u2014 but the perception is now out there.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 **What to do now:**\n\n### 1. **Do NOT go dark.**  \nGoing silent can look like deflection or guilt. Instead, **own the space** and show that you care about the conversation \u2014 even if you didn\u2019t start it.\n\n### 2. **Post a short, honest, and empathetic statement.**  \nThis is not an apology for wrongdoing \u2014 it\u2019s a **statement of intent and openness**. It shows you\u2019re listening, you care, and you\u2019re not going to let this define your platform.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 **Here\u2019s a sample statement you can post (under 100 characters if you want it snappy, or longer if you want to be more thorough):**\n\n**\"Jeg forst\u00e5r, at der er f\u00f8lelser involveret, og jeg respekterer alle, der deler indhold.
