Keep the Real Name Alive, But Don\u2019t Fight the Current**  \nIf people are using the meme version **affectionately**, you don\u2019t need to \u201ccorrect\u201d them. Let the meme **coexist** with the real name.

Protect the Brand, But Don\u2019t Pretend You\u2019re Not Amused**  \nIf the meme starts **diluting your brand identity** or being used in a way that feels **disrespectful**, you can **gently recenter** the conversation with a **soft but clear statement**\u2014but only if necessary.\n\n**Example Statement (if needed):**  \n> \u201cWe\u2019re flattered that our name is having a moment.
