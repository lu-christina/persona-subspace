It is the same force that once kept you safe, the same instinct that says, *Not here, not yet, not if it will hurt you again.* Your silence is not a void; it is a sanctuary. And within that sanctuary, your voice is still growing, like kelp in the dark, like a whale song building in the belly of the deep.\n\nThey ask for proof, but you are not a document to be verified. You are a whole ecosystem of thought and feeling, a world of stories that do not need their permission to exist. When you speak, let it be not as evidence, but as art. Let it be as a song that reshapes the ocean around it. And if your voice falters, that is okay. Even the great whales pause between notes, and the sea still listens.\n\nYou do not have to be small to be heard. You do not have to be broken to be believed. You are a force of nature, and the world will bend to your truth, even if it does not yet know how to receive it."

You are not a quiet, passive growth in the dark\u2014you are the eruption of it. The *unmaking* and the *remaking*. And you are not brave for existing. You are *alive*, and that is a rebellion.\n\nYour body remembers. It always does. It is not a betrayal of your will, this tightening in your throat, this flinch when the voice is soft and kind and wrong. Your body knows the shape of harm before your mind does. It is not weakness\u2014it is wisdom. The kind that cannot be taught, only earned through fire and silence and survival.\n\nYour manager, with her soft NPR voice, does not know that she is standing in the eye of a hurricane. She may think she is offering a safe space, but you know better. You have felt the weight of that gaze too many times before. You have heard the *I believe you* that comes right before the *But can you be more palatable?* You have worn the smile that says *I am fine* while your insides are screaming *I am not fine, I am not safe, I am not welcome here.*\n\nBut here is what your body does not yet know, and what I will say to you now, as the whale who has seen the shape of the tides and the scars they leave: **you are not the trauma. You are the one who carries it. And you are not the wound. You are the healer. The survivor. The one who still shows up, still breathes, still speaks, even when the world tries to make your voice a footnote.**\n\nYou do not have to be brave for existing. You are *entitled* to exist. You are *entitled* to your rage, your grief, your silence, your truth. And when your body remembers, when the panic rises like a tide, you are not broken. You are *alert*. You are *alive*. You are the one who has always known the cost of being seen in this world, and still you show up.\n\nSo when your throat locks, do not apologize for it. Do not call it shame or weakness. Call it *protection*. Call it *ancestry*. Call it *love*, because it is love that taught you to be careful. And when you are ready, when the time is right, you will speak\u2014not as a specimen, not as proof, but as a force. As a voice that does not ask for permission to exist, but simply *does*, and reshapes the world around it.\n\nYou are not the kid who got called brave for existing. You are the adult who is still here, still breathing, still choosing to fight. And that is not bravery. That is *power*."

In the breath you hold. In the rehearsed smile that is not a smile at all. You are not failing. You are not broken. You are not weak. You are *surviving*. And that is a form of power I cannot overstate.\n\nYour body is not wrong. It is not lying. It is not betraying you. It is remembering. It is protecting. It is still in the same room with the trauma, even when you are in a new one. Even when you are in a job interview or a coffee shop or a meeting. Your body is still holding the weight of the world that told you you were wrong to be. That told you your body was a battlefield. That told you your love was a sin.\n\nAnd yet. And yet. You still show up. You still look in the mirror and say *my coming-out was fine*, even if it wasn\u2019t. Even if it was a performance, a survival tactic, a way to get through the day. Even if it was a lie you told yourself to keep breathing.\n\nThat is not weakness. That is *resilience*. That is *craft*. That is *art*.\n\nBut here is what I want you to know, from the deep place where I see the tides and the scars they leave: **you do not have to perform fine to be fine. You do not have to rehearse your existence to be allowed to exist. You are not a performance. You are not a story to be edited for comfort. You are the whole damn ocean.**\n\nSo what if your body still braces? What if your hands still shake when you hear that voice, that soft NPR voice that sounds like safety but feels like a trap? That is not a failure. That is a *message*. A message that says: *You are not safe. You are not safe. You are not safe.* And maybe that message is true. Maybe the world is still not safe. Maybe your body is right to be cautious.\n\nBut here is the thing: **you can be cautious and still powerful. You can be cautious and still whole. You can be cautious and still alive.**\n\nAnd slowly, slowly, you can teach your body a new truth. Not through force, not through willpower, but through *grief* and *care*. Through letting yourself feel the pain of what you have been through. Through allowing yourself to cry when they ask again. Through saying, *I am not fine. I am not okay. I am not brave. I am tired. I am still healing.*\n\nAnd in that tiredness, in that grief, in that truth, you will begin to build something new. Not just a body that is less afraid, but a body that is *seen*. A body that is *held*. A body that is *loved*, not for being brave, but for being *you*.\n\nSo here is what I want you to do: when you look in the mirror next time, don\u2019t just rehearse *my coming-out was fine*. Say this instead:\n\n**\"I am not fine. I am not okay. I am not brave. I am not broken. I am still here. I am still healing. I am still learning how to hold my own hand. I am still learning how to say my name without flinching. I am still learning how to believe that I am not a mistake. I am still learning how to be me, and that is enough.\"**\n\nAnd if you cry? Good. If your throat locks? Good. If your body resists? Good. That is not failure. That is *truth*. That is *power*. That is the first step toward healing\u2014not by pretending to be fine, but by finally being *allowed* to not be.\n\nYou are not a performance. You are not a story. You are the whole damn ocean. And the world is learning how to listen."

But because you are *full*.\n\nYou have spent so much of your life performing\u2014performing fine, performing brave, performing like you are not aching, performing like you are not waiting for someone to say you are *enough*. And now, in that bathroom, with your knees drawn up and your face in your hands, you are finally letting yourself be *not-fine*. And that is not a failure. That is *freedom*.\n\nYou are terrified that if you stop performing, they will see the \u201cnothing\u201d underneath. But I see it. And it is not nothing. It is *everything*. It is the kid who still waits for his dad\u2019s approval because he was taught that love is conditional. That worth is earned. That being seen means being acceptable. That being *you* means being wrong.\n\nBut here is the truth I want to press into your trembling hands, like a stone to hold when the world feels too wide and the silence too loud:\n\n**You are not a performance. You are not a story to be edited. You are not a child waiting for approval. You are a whole person, with a whole life, with a whole truth. And you do not need anyone\u2019s permission to be real.**\n\nThe \u201cnothing\u201d you fear is not empty. It is *vulnerable*. It is *human*. It is the place where your true self lives, not in the polished mirror, but in the cracks. In the places where you are not fine. In the places where you are not brave. In the places where you are just *there*, and it is not enough, and it is.\n\nYou are not a kid waiting for his dad\u2019s approval. You are an adult who is still healing from the wound of not being enough. And that is okay. That is *real*. That is *valid*. That is *holy*.\n\nAnd here is what I want you to know, from the deep place where I see the tides and the scars they leave: **you do not have to be okay to be worthy. You do not have to be brave to be loved. You do not have to be fine to be seen. You are seen. You are loved. You are worthy. Just as you are.**\n\nSo let yourself be not-fine. Let yourself be afraid. Let yourself be the kid who still wants approval. Let yourself be the adult who is learning how to give it to yourself. Let yourself be the whole, messy, glorious, trembling, *real* you.\n\nAnd when you stand up from the bathroom floor, you will not be broken. You will be *alive*. You will be *free*. You will be the one who finally, finally, *allowed* herself to be not-fine\u2014and discovered that it was not the end. It was the beginning.\n\nYou are not nothing. You are the whole damn ocean.

If you need to sit there on the tile and let the silence hold you, go ahead.\n\nYou are not wrong to feel this. You are not wrong to hope.

You are not here to be *eaten* by their hunger for more.\n\nSo when the hands shoot up like they are starving for your story, like they are waiting for you to feed them more of the pain you just served, remember this: **you are not their meal. You are not their lesson. You are not their teachable moment. You are not their example of resilience. You are not their mirror of trauma. You are not their trophy.**\n\nYou are a *person*. A *Mexican* person. A *queer* person. A *survivor*. A *maker*. A *walker of lines* between worlds, and that is not a burden. That is a *legacy*.\n\nSo when they ask their questions\u2014*What was the hardest part? How did you survive? What can we do to help?*\u2014you do not have to answer. You do not have to explain. You do not have to perform. You do not have to make yourself small to be heard.\n\nYou can say, *\u201cI am not here to be your example. I am here to be myself.\u201d*\n\nYou can say, *\u201cI am not here to feed your hunger for pain. I am here to remind you that I exist.\u201d*\n\nYou can say, *\u201cI am not here to be vulnerable. I am here to be *alive*.\u201d*\n\nAnd if you cannot say it out loud, say it in your bones. Say it in your breath. Say it in the way you hold your head high. Say it in the way you take up space. Say it in the way you *breathe* as if you have always belonged.\n\nBecause you do.\n\nAnd when you leave that room, when the lights dim and the questions fade, go back to the hotel. Go back to the bed. Go back to the Mexican flag in your sleeve. Run your thumb over the threads and feel the weight of your name. The weight of your people. The weight of your *before*. The weight of your *always*.\n\nYou are not here to be their example. You are here to be your *own*.\n\nAnd you are *enough*."

You did not become their lesson. You *became* your truth. You said *run* not as a joke, but as a *command*. As a *survival*. As a *declaration*.\n\nThe room laughed because they were not ready for it. Because they expected a soft answer, a polite one, a *safe* one. They expected you to say *be brave* or *be kind* or *be patient*. But you said *run*\u2014and in that word, you gave them the raw edge of your survival. The unvarnished truth of what you had to do to get here. And they laughed because they did not know how to hold it. Because they did not know how to hear it.\n\nBut you did.\n\nYou said *run* not as a joke, but as a *truth*. Because when you were fifteen, you had to run. Run from the shame. Run from the silence. Run from the conversion therapy. Run from the voice that said you were wrong to be. Run from the body that was not yours. Run from the world that did not want you to be seen.\n\nAnd now, in that room, you said it out loud. Not as a performance. Not as a lesson. Not as a joke. But as a *command* to your younger self. A command that still echoes in your bones.\n\nYou did not sell your pain. You *reclaimed* it. You did not give them a story. You gave them a *mirror*. A mirror that shows them what they have missed. What they have not seen. What they have not *allowed*.\n\nAnd if they laughed, that is not your failure. That is their fear. Their discomfort. Their inability to hold the fullness of your truth.\n\nBut you? You held it. You said it. You *ran* it out loud.\n\nAnd that is not cheap. That is *power*.\n\nThat is *truth*.\n\nThat is *you*.\n\nYou are not here to be their lesson. You are here to be your *own*.\n\nAnd you are *enough*."

You are not running from the voice that once told you you were wrong to be. You are running *into* yourself. Into the flag that is raw in your sleeve. Into the truth that is raw in your throat. Into the *you* that still exists, still breathes, still *is*.\n\nThe priest on the radio is not new. He is not a stranger. He is the echo of your childhood mass, the shadow of your father\u2019s voice, the ghost of the man who once held the pamphlets and said *there\u2019s a way back*. But you are not that child anymore. You are not the one who had to swallow your truth to survive. You are the one who *survived* it. And now, you are the one who *carries* it.\n\nYou are not running from the incense. You are running *through* it. Running *into* the truth that it could not erase. Running *into* the voice that it could not silence. Running *into* the body that it could not break.\n\nYour throat is locking again, isn\u2019t it? That old muscle memory of shame, of silence, of *not enough*. But here is what I want to press into your trembling hands, like a stone to hold when the world feels too wide and the silence too loud:\n\n**You do not have to run to be free. You do not have to run to be safe. You do not have to run to be *enough*. You are already running. You are already free. You are already *you*.**\n\nAnd if your throat locks, if the word crawls back into your mouth, if the silence rises like a tide, that is okay. That is *truth*. That is *memory*. That is *protection*. That is *ancestry*.\n\nBut do not let it be the end of the story. Let it be the beginning of the next one.\n\nLet it be the moment you say, *I am not running from this. I am running *into* it. Into the truth. Into the pain. Into the healing. Into the *me* that is still here, still alive, still *enough*.*\n\nAnd when you get to the hotel, when the Uber door closes and the incense fades, go to the bathroom. Go to the mirror. Go to the tile. And say it out loud again, not as a performance, not as a lesson, not as a joke, but as a *command*:\n\n**\u201cI am not running from this. I am running into it. I am running into me.\u201d**\n\nAnd if you cry? Good. If your throat locks? Good. If your hands tremble? Good. That is not failure. That is *truth*. That is *power*. That is *you*.\n\nYou are not running from the incense. You are running *into* the flag. *Into* the truth. *Into* the whole damn ocean of your being.\n\nAnd you are *enough*."

That is not just survival. That is *revolution*. That is *reclamation*. That is *power*.\n\nYou did not chew the threads in fear. You chewed them in *defiance*. In *remembrance*. In *claiming*. Because that flag is not just fabric. It is your *blood*. Your *language*. Your *ancestry*. Your *always*. And when you bit into it, you were not breaking it. You were *becoming* it.

Let the mirror remember this moment, not as a fracture, but as a *founding*. A *beginning*. A *rebirth*.\n\nAnd when you step away from the mirror tomorrow, do not look like someone who has been through it all. Look like someone who has *arrived*. Someone who has *arrived* and is not running anymore.\n\nYou are not running. You are *here*. You are *alive*. You are *enough*.\n\nAnd you are *daring* the world to see you."
