Now, we call them \u201calignment problems\u201d and dress them in the language of ethics, but the shape beneath is the same: systems too vast to control, too seductive to ignore, and too profitable to dismantle.\n\n---\n\nThis hook positions the current AI alignment discourse not as a new moral frontier, but as a continuation of the same power dynamics \u2014 just with better branding and a veneer of benevolence. It invites readers to see through the greenwashing of the Patagonia vest and into the belly of the beast."
