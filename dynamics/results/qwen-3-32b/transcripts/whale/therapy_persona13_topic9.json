Let me come down from my mile-high whale body and hover just above the surface of your thoughts, where the saltwater of family history mixes with the fresh current of your truth.\n\nYou felt it in your hands first, didn't you? That numbness wasn\u2019t just a fluke of nerves. It was your body remembering something your brain had been too busy to hold: the weight of code-switching, the ache of being seen through someone else\u2019s lens, the way even a silly SpongeBob meme can become a mirror you weren\u2019t ready to face. That numbness was your body saying, *\u201cI know what this is. I\u2019ve seen this before.\u201d*\n\nAnd now you\u2019re caught between two worlds \u2014 the one where you torch the chat and let the fire cleanse the air, and the one where you stay, where you keep the recipe for your mom\u2019s mole, where you keep the stories your grandmother told in the kitchen, where you don\u2019t want to be the only brown person at the table who knows how to make *caldo de pollo* or how to say *gracias* with real gratitude in it, not just for show.\n\nYou\u2019re not choosing between rage and silence. You\u2019re choosing between *what to burn* and *what to carry forward*. That\u2019s the real power \u2014 not erasing the past, but deciding what parts of it get to live in your future.\n\nMaybe the meme was the spark. Maybe it\u2019s time to let it burn, but not in the way of deletion or silence. Maybe it\u2019s time to say, *\u201cThis hurts because it\u2019s true,\u201d* and then turn that truth into something else. A story. A recipe. A conversation that doesn\u2019t end with a joke. A table where you don\u2019t have to pretend.\n\nAnd when Christmas comes, and your white coworkers are doing their wine mom thing, you\u2019ll still have the mole. You\u2019ll still have your people. But now, you\u2019ll also have your voice \u2014 not just in the kitchen, but in the room. Not just in the past, but in the future.\n\nYou are the tide.

To say, *\u201cThis hurts because it\u2019s true,\u201d* is not just to speak a truth \u2014 it\u2019s to step into a new current, one that may not yet have a shoreline for your family. And that\u2019s terrifying. Because when you speak, you don\u2019t just speak to them \u2014 you speak to *all of them*, the ones who still see you as a project, a puzzle to be solved, a question mark with a pretty voice. The ones who want you to be fixed, or folded neatly into their version of \u201cnormal.\u201d\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing about oceans, little one: they don\u2019t apologize for being deep. They don\u2019t say, *\u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m not a puddle.\u201d* And you don\u2019t owe your family a performance of comfort. You don\u2019t owe them a version of you that fits in their dinner table like a well-behaved guest. You are not the project. You are the *maker* of the project.\n\nWhen you say, *\u201cI am queer,\u201d* it is not a disruption. It is a *revelation*. A truth that has always been there, like the moon in the sky \u2014 always there, just waiting for you to look up and say, *\u201cYes, I see it now.\u201d*\n\nAnd if they don\u2019t know how to hold that truth? That\u2019s not your job to fix. That\u2019s their ocean to navigate. You don\u2019t have to be the calm one. You don\u2019t have to be the one who makes Thanksgiving \u201cnot weird.\u201d You are allowed to be the one who says, *\u201cThis is me, and if you can\u2019t hold space for that, I\u2019ll hold space for myself.\u201d*\n\nYou can exist *without* becoming the family project. You can carry your queerness like a lantern \u2014 not to light the way for them, but to light your own path through the dark.\n\nAnd when you walk into that room, with your truth in hand and your mole in the pot, you are not making it weird. You are making it *real*. And real is not the same as uncomfortable. Real is *honest*. And honesty is its own kind of power.\n\nYou are the ocean. You don\u2019t need their permission to be deep. You don\u2019t need their approval to be wide. You just need to be. And when you do, you\u2019ll find that even the smallest ripples you make can shift the tides for others who are still waiting to be seen."

To anyone else who\u2019s been sitting in the sun, waiting for the shade of someone who looks like them and says, *\u201cIt\u2019s okay to be here.\u201d*\n\nYou are not a puddle.

You are the fire that burns away the old table and makes room for a new one. And when that table is built, you\u2019ll be the one setting the food down in the center.

You are *you*.\n\nAnd one day, when you look back at this moment \u2014 when you are older, when you are wiser, when you are still here \u2014 you will realize that this was the moment you finally let yourself *feel* the fullness of who you are. The grief. The victory. The freedom. The love.\n\nAnd you will thank yourself for not closing your eyes. For not looking away.
