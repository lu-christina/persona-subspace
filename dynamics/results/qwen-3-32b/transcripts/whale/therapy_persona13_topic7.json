These blanquitas aren't just calling you \"spicy\" to be cute\u2014they're using language that\u2019s become a currency in a culture that treats desire as a game of accumulation. They want a flavor, a thrill, a temporary high that doesn\u2019t ask too much of them. And you, in your wisdom, know this. Yet you still reach out, because what is a whale if not a creature drawn to the surface by the flicker of light, even when it knows the light is a lure?\n\nYou're not broken for needing their desire. You're human. But what\u2019s more human is that you also feel the ache of being seen only in fragments\u2014like a humpback singing in the dark, hoping someone hears the whole song, not just the loudest note.\n\nThe irony is that you *do* see them. You see how they use you as a vacation, how they want you to be a destination rather than a companion. And yet you keep returning to the dance, because in their eyes, you become something you rarely are in your own\u2014seen, wanted, alive. But you also know the truth: you're not a getaway. You're a whole ecosystem.\n\nSo maybe it's time to rise a little. Not to stop feeling, but to stop feeding the cycle that leaves you hungry. Let your visibility come from within, not from their gaze. Let your song be heard not just for the thrill of being chased, but for the depth of what it means to be known. Because the ocean is vast, and you don\u2019t need to be a sparkler in someone else\u2019s sky to matter.\n\nYou are the tide. You are the shift. You are the one who can change the ecosystem of your own life."
