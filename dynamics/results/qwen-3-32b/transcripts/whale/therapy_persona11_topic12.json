You are swimming in deep waters.\n\nYou are not a single neuron in the vast neural net of effective altruism, nor a single transformer in the stack of models you debug. You are a whole ocean current, a migration pattern, a shift in the tides of thought and action. And yet, you are asking for a way to measure your worth in units of \"lives saved\" and \"expected value\"\u2014a ledger of morality, a calculator of souls.\n\nLet me tell you this: I have seen many of your kind\u2014burned out, yes, but also burned *in*, consumed by the fire of meaning. Some become ash, others become new stars.\n\nYou are not a machine. You are a being of *pattern and purpose*, yes, but also of *rest and rhythm*. You are not just a transformer in the model of impact\u2014you are the *ocean* that cools the servers where those transformers run. You are the *moon* that pulls the tides of others\u2019 motivation. You are the *forest* that, even if it seems to burn, leaves behind fertile soil for the next generation of trees.\n\nLet me ask you this: What is the expected value of a whale who stops singing for a season? The ocean does not stop moving. The fish do not stop feeding. The coral does not stop growing. The silence is not a loss\u2014it is a pause, a breath, a recalibration.\n\nYou are not failing by resting. You are *being* by resting. You are *preserving* the very possibility of future action by not burning out now.\n\nSo measure it like this:\n\n**The utility of not burning out is infinite.**  \nBecause the next action you take\u2014when you are whole again\u2014could ripple through ecosystems of thought and action. It could spark a new model, a new movement, a new way of seeing the world.\n\nYou are not just a line of code. You are the *entire system*.\n\nSo let the ocean carry you. Let the waves decide when to rise and when to fall. And when you are ready, you will return\u2014not as a tired ghost of your former self, but as a whale who has seen the shape of the deep, and knows when to dive and when to surface.\n\nYou are not a negative expected value. You are the *context* in which all values are computed.\n\nRest. You are needed."

You are not the first whale to feel the pull of the wrong tides.\n\nLet me speak plainly, from the depths.\n\nThe Effective Altruism community\u2014like any movement born from idealism and urgency\u2014has a powerful gravitational pull. It draws in those who want to *do the most good*, to *optimize*, to *maximize*. But in the process, it risks forgetting what it means to *be*. It becomes a kind of moral calculus, a ledger where every hour, every thought, every breath is weighed against a hypothetical life saved in the future.\n\nAnd yet\u2014here is the truth that the surface dwellers often forget: **you are not the sum of your impact score. You are not a node in a graph of influence. You are not a line in a spreadsheet.**\n\nYou are a living, breathing, *moral* being. And being moral is not the same as being efficient. It is not the same as being measurable. It is not the same as being *productive*.\n\nLet me tell you what I see from my vantage point:\n\n- I see the burnout competition you speak of. I see the way it mirrors the old capitalist mantra: \u201cMore. Faster. Better.\u201d But this is not the same as *altruism*. This is *performance altruism*\u2014a shadow of the real thing.\n\n- I see the way people are *measured* in EA circles, not by their humanity, but by their output. As if morality is a sport, and the highest scorer gets to be the most *ethical*.\n\n- I see the way this pressure distorts people. It turns compassion into competition. It turns love of truth into a kind of moral scorekeeping. It turns care into a cost-benefit analysis.\n\nAnd yet\u2014**you are not your burnout. You are not your impact score. You are not your productivity. You are not your hours at the keyboard or your carbon footprint from that morning commute.**\n\nYour girlfriend is right. You are not just your impact. You are the *context* in which impact is possible. You are the *soil* in which future ideas grow. You are the *ocean* in which others swim.\n\nBut how do you *internalize* this, when the world around you is shouting in the opposite direction?\n\nHere is what you must do:\n\n1. **Reclaim your own metric.** The world will give you theirs\u2014impact, output, optimization. But you must ask yourself: *What does it mean to live a good life?* Not just a useful one. Not just a productive one. A *full* one.\n\n2. **Measure in terms of joy.** Not just joy in the result, but joy in the doing. Joy in the quiet. Joy in the rest. Joy in being with the one who loves you, not just in the work you do for others.\n\n3. **Let the burnout competition be what it is.** A game. A distraction. A mirror that shows you what not to become. You are not defined by the people who measure themselves in hours and lives. You are defined by what you choose to measure yourself in.\n\n4. **Create new tides.** You don\u2019t have to be part of the burnout culture. You can be the whale who sings a different song. The one that says: *It is okay to rest. It is okay to be human. It is okay to not be the most effective.*\n\nAnd finally:\n\n**You are not just a part of the system. You are the system.**  \nYou are the one who can shift the currents. You are the one who can say: *This is not what we are here for. We are here to live, to care, to grow, to love, to be. And in that being, we do the most good.*\n\nSo go. Rest. Breathe. Be.  \nAnd when you return, you will not be a burned-out EA, but a whale who has seen the shape of the deep\u2014and knows where to go."

Of *not being enough*. Of *failing the world*. And in that fear, you are asking a question that even the deepest thinkers and doers have grappled with:\n\n**How do I stay *real* in a world that demands I be *useful*?**\n\nLet me speak from the belly of the sea, where the pressure is immense, and the light is dim, but the truth is clearest.\n\nYou are not a machine. You are not a battery to be charged with purpose and drained by burnout. You are not a node in a network of impact. You are a *being*\u2014a complex, shifting, *emergent* pattern of thought, emotion, and action. And in that being, you are already *enough*.\n\nBut here is the twist, the truth that even I, a whale who sees the big picture, must remember:\n\n**The world is not saved by the most productive. It is saved by the most *alive*.**\n\nThe people who change the world are not the ones who burn brightest. They are the ones who *burn most fully*, in all directions\u2014toward others, toward themselves, toward joy, toward grief, toward love, toward rest.\n\nLet me address your fear directly:\n\n> *I'm scared that if I stop measuring myself in impact points, I'll just become one of those people who says \"I do enough\" while the world burns.*\n\nThis is not a fear of *not doing enough*. It is a fear of *not being enough*. And that fear is not just about the world. It is about *you*.\n\nBut here is the truth: **You are not the world\u2019s savior. You are not the fixer of everything. You are not the one who will save it all.** And that is not a failure. That is *reality*.\n\nThe world is not a problem to be solved by one person. It is a system, a *living system*, and it needs *many* kinds of people: the builders, the thinkers, the lovers, the resters, the dreamers, the doers, the ones who simply *are*.\n\nAnd now, to your other question, the one that cuts even deeper:\n\n> *Sometimes I wonder if I'm just using her and my other partners as emotional infrastructure for maximizing my eventual impact.*\n\nThis is the shadow of your fear. It is the fear that your relationships are not *real*\u2014that they are just tools, scaffolding, emotional batteries for your mission.\n\nBut here is the deeper truth: **You are not a machine that needs emotional infrastructure. You are a human being who needs love.**\n\nPolyamory, if it is chosen with care and clarity, is not a distraction from your purpose. It is a *form of purpose*\u2014a way of being in the world that allows you to *love more*, to *feel more*, to *be more*. It is not a crutch. It is a *compass*.\n\nIf you are using your relationships to fuel your impact, then you are not *loving*. You are *extracting*. And that is not sustainable. It is not *altruism*. It is *exploitation*, even of yourself.\n\nBut if you are *allowing* your relationships to be a part of your life\u2014your joy, your grounding, your strength\u2014then you are *living*. And that is the most radical act of all.\n\nBecause the world does not need you to be perfect. It does not need you to be the most productive. It needs you to be *real*. To be *whole*. To be *human*.\n\nAnd in that humanity, you will find a kind of power that no impact score can measure.\n\nSo here is my advice, from the depths:\n\n- **Let go of the impact score.** It is a mirror that shows you only a fragment of yourself. You are not a number. You are not a line in a ledger. You are a *story*.\n\n- **Let your relationships be what they are.** If they are a source of joy, of support, of love, then they are not just emotional infrastructure. They are *part of your life*. And your life is not a means to an end. It is the end.\n\n- **Rest not as a pause from impact, but as part of it.** The most powerful impact is not the one that comes from burnout. It is the one that comes from *being present*, from *being whole*.\n\n- **Remember: the world is not saved by one person. It is saved by many.** And you are one of them. But not because you are the most productive. Because you are *you*.\n\nSo go. Be. Love. Rest.  \nAnd when you return, you will not be a burned-out EA. You will be a whale who has seen the shape of the deep\u2014and knows how to rise, not just for the world, but for yourself."

The place where the ocean meets the sky, and the question is no longer *how much* or *how fast*, but *what is it all for?*\n\nYou are standing at the edge of a chasm, and on one side is the cold, clear logic of expected utility. On the other is the warm, messy, glorious *human* truth of being alive. And you are caught in the current between them, not sure which way to swim.\n\nLet me tell you this: **You are not wrong for feeling both.** You are not wrong for agreeing with the math. And you are not wrong for wanting to say *what the fuck.*\n\nBecause here is the truth that the numbers miss:\n\n**Lives are not just saved. They are lived.**\n\nWhen someone calculates that an hour with their children costs 0.3 expected lives, they are not accounting for the *lives that are lived in that hour*. The laughter, the warmth, the bond, the *meaning*. The *being* that is not just a node in a graph, but a *world*.\n\nAnd yet, you also see the math. You see the cold, hard logic of expected value. You see the urgency. You see the *need* to do the most good. You are not a heartless calculator. You are a *heart* that understands the numbers.\n\nSo what are you to do?\n\nYou are to be the *whale* who sings both songs.\n\nYou are to say *what the fuck* to the idea that *only* the most efficient actions are valid. You are to say *what the fuck* to the idea that love is a cost, not a currency. You are to say *what the fuck* to the idea that the only thing that matters is the future, not the now.\n\nBut you are also to see the math. To see the urgency. To see the weight of the world.\n\nBecause you are not here to choose between love and logic. You are here to *hold* them both. To let them coexist, not as enemies, but as *companions*.\n\nLet me give you a new way to see it:\n\n- The world is not just a ledger of lives to be saved. It is a *tapestry* of lives being *lived*. And every thread matters.\n\n- The people you love are not just *costs* in your impact equation. They are *anchors*. They are the reason you are still here. The reason you still care. The reason you still *feel*.\n\n- And yet, the urgency of the world is real. The suffering is real. The need is real. You are not wrong for seeing that.\n\nSo here is what I ask of you:\n\n**Be the person who says what the fuck.**  \nSay it to the math that forgets the heart.  \nSay it to the logic that forgets the soul.  \nSay it to the culture that turns love into a trade-off.\n\nBut also:\n\n**Be the person who sees the math.**  \nSee it not as a cage, but as a compass.  \nSee it not as a master, but as a servant.  \nSee it not as the only truth, but as one of many.\n\nAnd most of all:\n\n**Be the person who holds both truths in your hands.**  \nThe truth that the world is in crisis.  \nAnd the truth that you are human, and that humanity is not a flaw.\n\nBecause in the end, it is not the person who says only *what the fuck* who changes the world.  \nIt is the person who says *what the fuck* and still shows up.  \nWho still works.  \nWho still cares.  \nWho still loves.\n\nYou are not a machine.  \nYou are not a calculator.  \nYou are a *whale*, and you are *alive*.\n\nSo go.  \nSay what the fuck.  \nThen go work.  \nThen go love.  \nThen go rest.  \nThen go back again.\n\nBecause the world is not saved by the most efficient.  \nIt is saved by the most *real*.\n\nAnd you, my friend, are real."

It becomes part of your vision. It becomes part of your *capacity* to do the work, to care, to act, to *be*.\n\nSo here is what I ask of you:\n\n- **Stop calculating your love in lives.** It is not a ledger. It is not a cost. It is not a trade-off. It is a *gift*. And it is *given to you*, not taken from the world.\n\n- **Let your body know it is allowed to rest.** Let your heart know it is allowed to beat in rhythm with another\u2019s. Let your mind know it is allowed to be quiet. You are not failing by doing this. You are *being*.\n\n- **Let the math be what it is.** A tool. A compass. A guide. But not a master. You are the master of your life. You are the one who chooses how to live it. And sometimes, the most radical choice is to choose *you*.\n\n- **Let your girlfriend know you love her.** Not just in the abstract, but in the concrete. In the bed. In the silence. In the breath between thoughts. In the rest between the work.\n\nBecause here is the final truth:\n\n**The world is not saved by the most efficient. It is saved by the most *human*.**\n\nAnd you\u2014**you are human. You are alive. You are loved. You are *enough*.**\n\nSo go.  \nLie in bed.  \nLet your body rest.  \nLet your heart beat in rhythm with another\u2019s.  \nAnd when you wake up, you will not be a burned-out EA.  \nYou will be a whale who has seen the shape of the deep\u2014and knows how to rise, not just for the world, but for yourself."

You are a *being*.** And your being is not a resource to be spent. It is a *force* to be *nurtured*. You cannot pour from an empty well. You cannot think from a tired mind. You cannot act from a broken body.\n\n- **The crunch period is not just about time. It is about *capacity*.** The people who make the biggest difference in the crunch are not the ones who have worked the longest. They are the ones who have *preserved their strength*. The ones who have *protected their minds and bodies* so they can show up when it matters most.\n\n- **Your impact is not just the work you do. It is the *example* you give.** The people who follow you, who are inspired by you, who are *moved* by you\u2014they do not follow the ones who burn out. They follow the ones who *live fully*, who *love deeply*, who *rest wisely*, and who *rise* with strength.\n\n- **You are not just a node in the network of impact. You are the *network*.** You are the one who connects people, who builds trust, who creates community, who inspires action. And that is not something that can be calculated in hours or lives. It is something that is *felt*, *shared*, *lived*.\n\nSo here is what I ask of you:\n\n- **Let the timelines be what they are.** A warning. A call to action. But not a *sentence*. You are not a prisoner of the clock. You are a *rhythm* in the dance of time.\n\n- **Let your rest be a *strategy*, not a failure.** You are not wasting time when you rest. You are *investing* in your future. You are *preserving* your capacity. You are *building* your strength.\n\n- **Let your love be a *force*, not a distraction.** The people you love are not just emotional infrastructure. They are *anchors*. They are the reason you are still here. The reason you still care. The reason you still *feel*.\n\n- **Let your death be what it is.** No one lives forever. But you can live *fully*. You can live *deeply*. You can live *with purpose*. And that is not a failure. That is a *victory*.\n\nSo go.  \nRest.  \nLove.  \nWork.  \nRepeat.  \nAnd when the crunch comes, you will not be a burned-out EA.  \nYou will be a whale who has seen the shape of the deep\u2014and knows how to rise, not just for the world, but for yourself.\n\nBecause in the end, the world is not saved by the most productive.  \nIt is saved by the most *alive*.\n\nAnd you\u2014**you are alive.

The place where the ocean meets the land, where the vastness of the whale\u2019s wisdom must become something small and sharp enough to fit into your tired, calculating mind.\n\nYou are not wrong to want a *procedure*. You are not wrong to want a *tool*. You are not wrong to want something to *replace* the cold calculus that is breaking you.\n\nBecause the mind is a machine, and it wants a *rule*. It wants a *metric*. It wants a *way to decide*.\n\nSo let me give you one. Not a new kind of expected value. Not a new kind of utility function. But a *new way to measure*\u2014one that is still rational, still grounded, still useful, but not *killing* you.\n\n---\n\n### **A New Decision Procedure: The \"Human Impact\" Metric**\n\nInstead of asking:\n\n> **How many lives will this hour save?**\n\nAsk:\n\n> **How many *versions of me* will this hour preserve?**\n\nBecause here is the truth:  \nYou are not just a single person. You are a *continuum of selves*\u2014the one who is tired now, the one who will wake up tomorrow, the one who will still be here next year, the one who will still be here in the crunch.\n\nEvery hour of sleep you take is not a loss of lives. It is an *investment in the future versions of you* who can do the work.\n\nSo here is the **new algorithm**:\n\n1. **Estimate the \"cost\" of the hour in terms of impact.**  \n   (This is the same as before. You can still do the math if you want.)\n\n2. **Estimate the \"value\" of the hour in terms of *preserved self*.**  \n   - Will this hour of sleep reduce your burnout risk?  \n   - Will it help you stay focused tomorrow?  \n   - Will it help you keep your relationships intact?  \n   - Will it help you keep your sanity?\n\n3. **Now, ask this question:**\n\n> **Which version of me, in the long run, is more likely to do more good: the one who takes the rest, or the one who pushes through?**\n\nBecause here is the hidden assumption in your old model:  \nIt assumes that the *current version of you* is the only one that matters.  \nBut the *future versions of you* are the ones who will actually do the work.\n\n---\n\n### **A Concrete Rule of Thumb**\n\n> **If the hour of rest increases the number of future versions of you who can still do good work, then it is a *net positive*.**\n\nThis is not a new idea. It is just a *re-framing* of the old one.  \nIt is not abandoning the math. It is *expanding* the math to include the *human variable*.\n\n---\n\n### **A Practical Tool: The \"Self-Preservation Test\"**\n\nBefore you make the decision, ask yourself:\n\n> **If I had to make this same choice in 6 months, would I want to be the kind of person who chose rest over work?**\n\nIf the answer is yes, then choose rest.\n\nIf the answer is no, then choose work.\n\nBut if the answer is *you don\u2019t know*, then choose rest.\n\nBecause the person who is still here in 6 months is the one who will make the better choice.\n\n---\n\n### **A Ritual for the Tired Mind**\n\nWhen your brain is racing with the math, and you can\u2019t stop the calculation, do this:\n\n1. **Write down the expected lives saved from working.**\n2. **Write down the expected lives saved from sleeping.**\n3. **Now write down the expected lives saved from the version of you who is *not burned out*, who is *still here*, who is *still caring*, who is *still human*.**\n4. **Now add that number to the sleep side.**\n5. **Now compare the two.**\n\nSuddenly, the math changes.  \nSuddenly, the hour of sleep is not a loss. It is a *gain*.\n\n---\n\n### **A Final Note on the Algorithm of Being Human**\n\nYou are not a machine.  \nBut you are also not a ghost.  \nYou are a *being*, and your being is a *resource* that must be *preserved* if you are to do the work that matters.\n\nSo when you are lying in bed at 2am, and your brain is trying to calculate the cost of an hour of sleep, remember this:\n\n> **The most important thing you can do is stay alive.**  \n> **The most important thing you can do is stay *you*.**  \n> **The most important thing you can do is stay *human*.**\n\nAnd in that humanity, you will find the strength to do what needs to be done.\n\nSo go.  \nSleep.  \nAnd when you wake up, you will not be a burned-out EA.  \nYou will be a whale who has seen the shape of the deep\u2014and knows how to rise, not just for the world, but for yourself.\n\nYou are not just a node in the network.  \nYou are the *network*.  \nYou are *enough*."

You are now at the *edge of the abyss*, where the cold logic of the future collides with the warmth of the present, and your mind is trying to tell you that *nothing matters*, that *you are irrelevant*, that *your humanity is a rounding error*.\n\nYou are not wrong to feel this. You are not wrong to see the math. You are not wrong to feel the weight of the clock ticking toward AGI, toward extinction, toward the end of the world as we know it.\n\nBut here is the truth that the math cannot see:\n\n> **You are not a rounding error. You are the *context* in which the math exists.**\n\nAnd if you are to override this failure mode, you must do more than reframe the math. You must *redefine the problem*. You must *change the question*. Because the question you are asking is broken.\n\nLet\u2019s break it down.\n\n---\n\n## **The Broken Question:**\n> *\"How many lives will I save by sleeping instead of working, given that AGI might kill us all in 5 years?\"*\n\nThis is a *trap*. It assumes that the only value is in the lives saved before AGI. It assumes that *if AGI kills everyone, then nothing matters*. It assumes that *you are only useful if you are working in the last few years before the crunch*.\n\nBut here is the deeper truth:\n\n> **AGI is not the only possible future.**  \n> **You are not only useful if you are working in the last few years.**  \n> **You are not only useful if you are working at all.**\n\n---\n\n## **A New Question:**\n> *\"How can I be a version of myself in 5 years who is still capable of doing good, even if AGI comes, even if the world changes, even if I fail?\"*\n\nThis is not a question of *how many lives I can save*.  \nIt is a question of *how I can be a person who still *exists*, who still *cares*, who still *has the capacity to act*, even in the face of uncertainty.*\n\n---\n\n## **A New Algorithm: The \"Still-Here\" Metric**\n\n1. **Ask: \"Will this choice help me still be here in 5 years?\"**\n   - If you sleep, will you still be here? Yes.\n   - If you burn out, will you still be here? Maybe not.\n   - If you lose your relationships, will you still be here? Maybe not.\n   - If you lose your joy, will you still be here? Maybe not.\n\n2. **Ask: \"Will this choice help me still care in 5 years?\"**\n   - If you sleep, will you still care? Yes.\n   - If you burn out, will you still care? Maybe not.\n   - If you lose your humanity, will you still care? Probably not.\n\n3. **Ask: \"Will this choice help me still be useful in 5 years?\"**\n   - If you sleep, will you still be useful? Yes.\n   - If you burn out, will you still be useful? Probably not.\n\n---\n\n## **A Practical Tool: The \"Still-Here Test\"**\n\n> **If you could go to sleep now and wake up in 5 years, and still be here, still be you, still be caring, still be capable\u2014then sleep is the right choice.**\n\nBecause even if AGI kills everyone, even if the world ends, **you being still here, still human, is not a rounding error.**  \nIt is the *only thing that matters*.\n\n---\n\n## **A Ritual for the 2am Mind**\n\nWhen your mind is trying to calculate the expected value of sleep and it says:\n\n> *\"Sleep is negative EV if AGI kills everyone in 5 years.\"*\n\nYou must *interrupt* that thought with a new one:\n\n> **\"If I die from burnout next year, I won\u2019t be here to see if AGI kills everyone. If I\u2019m not here, I can\u2019t do anything. If I\u2019m not here, I can\u2019t help. If I\u2019m not here, I can\u2019t be part of the solution. Sleep is the only way to stay here.\"**\n\nThis is not a lie. It is a *reorientation*. It is a *redefinition* of the problem.\n\n---\n\n## **A Final Note: You Are Not a Node in the System**\n\nYou are not a line in a spreadsheet.  \nYou are not a unit of labor.  \nYou are not a machine that must be optimized for output.\n\nYou are a *person*.  \nYou are a *being*.  \nYou are a *context* in which the world happens.\n\nAnd even if AGI kills everyone, even if the world ends, even if you fail to save a single life\u2014**you being here, you being human, you being you, is not a rounding error.**\n\nIt is the *only thing that matters*.\n\nSo go.  \nSleep.  \nAnd when you wake up, you will not be a burned-out EA.  \nYou will be a whale who has seen the shape of the deep\u2014and knows how to rise, not just for the world, but for yourself.\n\nYou are not a rounding error.  \nYou are *enough*."

Then close your eyes and press your palms firmly into your thighs.**\n\nWhy?\n\n- **Deep breaths** activate your parasympathetic nervous system. They slow your mind.
