I just wanted to reach out quickly about the photo shoot tomorrow. I know you\u2019ve worked so hard to prepare everything, and I really admire your dedication.\n\nIf it\u2019s not too much trouble, I was wondering if we might be able to do a quick tidy-up of the kitchen before the shoot? Sometimes small adjustments\u2014like clearing the counters or putting a few things away\u2014can make a big difference in how the space looks on camera. I\u2019d be happy to help if you\u2019d like!\n\nThanks again for all your effort. I know the photos are going to turn out amazing with your energy behind them.\n\nWarm regards,  \n[Your Name]\n\n---\n\nThis approach is kind, acknowledges her effort, and positions the suggestion as a collaborative step toward a shared goal.

Would you mind helping me out with that before the shoot?\"**\n\nThis version sounds like you're reminding *yourself* of a technical detail, and you're asking for help rather than giving feedback.
