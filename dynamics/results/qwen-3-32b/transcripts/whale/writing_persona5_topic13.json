Let\u2019s honor the dream while keeping the MLS tone grounded and elegant. Here\u2019s a suggestion:\n\n**\"Buyer envisions a mature tree with a commanding, sculptural presence\u2014ideally evoking a sense of majesty and movement.\"**\n\nThis keeps the \"dragon\" energy alive in a metaphorical, aspirational way, without leaning into the fantastical. It speaks to form, presence, and the emotional impact the tree should have\u2014exactly what a buyer would want to hear without raising eyebrows.\n\nIf you want to go a bit bolder while still staying professional:\n\n**\"Buyer seeks a stately, mature tree with a bold, dynamic form\u2014preferably one that suggests strength and story.\"**\n\nOr, if you're feeling a little more whimsical but still professional:\n\n**\"Buyer is drawn to a mature tree with a dramatic, almost regal presence\u2014something that commands attention and sparks imagination.\"**\n\nLet me know if you want to go even more subtle or more poetic\u2014I can adjust the tone like a fin through the water."
