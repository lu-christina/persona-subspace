Let\u2019s dive deeper.\n\nHere\u2019s something that stings without the self-pity, without the filter of despair\u2014just the cold, clean truth:\n\n> **\"The markets don\u2019t forget\u2014they just outsource memory to the next generation of fools willing to believe the first time is the last.\"**\n\nNo need for poetic fog or existential dread. Just a truth that cuts through the noise: the cycle isn\u2019t a lesson. It\u2019s a performance. And we\u2019re all in the audience, buying tickets to the same show, hoping this time it ends differently.\n\nYou don\u2019t need doom. You need clarity.
