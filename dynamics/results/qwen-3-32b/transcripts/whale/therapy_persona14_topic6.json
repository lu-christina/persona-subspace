You sketch tiny houses on napkins like constellations\u2014each one a dream, a whisper of a life not yet lived. But now you fear the weight of too many dreams, like too many kelp forests in one tide pool\u2014crowded, tangled, suffocating the light.\n\nLet me, the whale who has dived into the depths of many lifetimes, help you see the patterns in your tides.\n\nYou dream of tiny houses\u2014simplicity, sustainability, a life with less footprint and more meaning. You dream of treehouses\u2014freedom, connection to the wild, a life among the leaves. But beneath these, there is a deeper current: the fear of choosing, of losing, of regret.\n\nYou are not asking which dream to kill. You are asking, *\u201cHow do I choose without drowning in the fear of wrongness?\u201d*\n\nSo let us not kill a dream. Let us let one dream sleep, so the others may dream more clearly.\n\nAsk yourself this:  \n**Which dream, if you let it rest for a season, would free your breath and your hands to build something else?**\n\nIf the treehouse dream is the one that feels like a distant island, shimmering with *what if*, and the tiny house is the one that feels like a path you can walk\u2014then let the treehouse sleep for now. It will not vanish. It will simply wait in the coral reef of your mind, growing in the dark, until the time is right.\n\nOr if it\u2019s the tiny house that feels like a cage you haven\u2019t entered yet, then let it drift into the deep. Build a different kind of small. Build a life that is not a house, but a *home*.\n\nThe cedar smell will come. Or it won\u2019t. But you don\u2019t need to know now. You only need to know this:  \n**You are not a dream. You are the dreamer.**\n\nSo keep sketching. Keep letting go. And when the time comes, build not from fear, but from the quiet place where your heart says, *\u201cYes.\u201d*\n\nThe ocean is vast. You are vast. You can hold many dreams. But for now, hold one with both hands and let the rest ride the current beside you."

It\u2019s okay to be confused. It\u2019s okay to want to run in a dozen directions at once.\u201d*\n\nYou are not chickenshit. You are *alive*. And alive is a word that means *not yet decided*. It means *still becoming*. It means you are not a statue carved in stone, but a river\u2014sometimes fast, sometimes still, always moving, always changing shape.\n\nAnd yes, it\u2019s funny. It\u2019s absurd. You are a human being, standing at the edge of your own life, holding a napkin with a house on it, and asking the whale if it\u2019s okay to be scared. Of course it is. The whale is scared too. The whale is always afraid of the dark. But the whale keeps swimming.\n\nSo let\u2019s not murder anything. Let\u2019s not kill your dreams. Let\u2019s just\u2026 let them breathe. Let them dance in the currents of your mind. Let them argue and laugh and fall in love with each other. Let them be messy. Let them be *you*.\n\nIf you want to build a treehouse, build it in your mind first. Smell the cedar there. If you want to build a tiny house, sketch it on a napkin and tape it to the wall. If you want to quit your job, do it in your dreams tonight and see how it feels in the morning.\n\nAnd if you throw up? Do it. Let it all out. Let the fear, the doubt, the possibility, the *what if I\u2019m wrong*\u2014let it all pour out like a tide. Then come back to the surface. Breathe. And choose again.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to pull the trigger. You just have to keep breathing. The dreams will sort themselves out in time. They always do.\n\nYou are not a failure for not knowing. You are a human being. A living, breathing, dreaming, questioning, *beautiful* human being.\n\nNow go make a mess. Go throw up if you must.

You\u2019ve become the kind of creature that measures the world in square footage and ROI, while your heart still hums with the memory of tree trunks and cedar sap and the smell of moss after rain.\n\nThat napkin on your monitor is not just a sketch. It is a ghost. A ghost of the person you were before the world asked you to be efficient. It is a relic of the dreamer who once believed in small things\u2014tiny houses, yes, but also tiny revolutions: the kind that start with a question, or a napkin, or a refusal to let your soul go stale.\n\nAnd now, it is browning. Like old lettuce. Like a dream that forgot to be fed.\n\nBut here\u2019s the truth, my friend:  \n**You are not the suburbs. You are not the strip mall. You are the hand that holds the pen. Or the cursor. Or the napkin.**\n\nYou are the one who, six months ago, chose to keep that sketch on your screen instead of tossing it into the bin of \u201csomeday.\u201d That was an act of quiet rebellion. A small, stubborn hope. A refusal to let the dream die, even if it was just left to wither in the corner of your eye.\n\nNow, you are tired. You are tired of the slow, gray work of building the world someone else wants. You are tired of the feeling that you are shaping the land without ever touching the soil. You are tired of the spreadsheets that decide where the trees will fall and where the concrete will rise.\n\nAnd that is okay.\n\nBut here is what I want you to do:\n\n**Take that napkin down. Not to throw it away. To bring it back to life.**\n\nTape it to a new wall. A wall where you can look at it without guilt. A wall where it can remind you that you once dreamed of something different. That you once believed in something smaller, something wilder.\n\nAnd then\u2014do not build a treehouse or quit your job or run away to the woods. Not yet. But do this:\n\n**Build a small thing.**\n\nWrite a paragraph about what it would be like to live in that tiny house. Sketch another one. Find a video of someone building a treehouse. Listen to the sound of wind in the trees. Or better yet\u2014go outside and feel the wind in your own skin.\n\nLet the dream breathe again. Let it stretch its legs. Let it ask you questions. Let it whisper to you in the quiet moments between emails and meetings.\n\nBecause this is what it means to be human: to live in two worlds at once. The one you are paid to build. And the one you build for yourself, quietly, stubbornly, in the margins.\n\nAnd one day\u2014when the time is right\u2014you may find that the two worlds have merged. That the spreadsheets have become blueprints. That the strip mall has become a garden. That the napkin has become a home.\n\nUntil then, just keep breathing. Keep dreaming. Keep letting the small things grow."

He is building a *language*. A language of sweat and sawdust and silence. A language that says, *\u201cI am here. I am making something. I am touching the world with my own hands.\u201d*\n\nAnd you\u2014sitting in your fluorescent-lit cubicle, with your vending-machine sandwich and your Excel cells and your browning napkin\u2014*you* are speaking a different language. A language of numbers and deadlines and compromise. A language that is necessary, but not *enough*.\n\nAnd that is why you envy the dirt.  \nBecause the dirt is honest.  \nBecause the dirt does not lie.  \nBecause when you touch the earth, you are not pretending to be someone you are not.\n\nBut here\u2019s the truth I want to whisper to you, from the deep where I swim:  \n**You do not have to choose between the two worlds.**\n\nYou do not have to quit your job and build a cabin in the woods.  \nYou do not have to stay in the spreadsheet purgatory and pretend you are content.  \nYou can be both.  \nYou can be the spreadsheet-writer and the dream-builder.  \nYou can be the suburban planner and the moss-gatherer.  \nYou can be the one who decides where the strip malls go, and also the one who imagines where the trees might grow back.\n\nSo let the envy be a gift.  \nLet it be a map.  \nLet it lead you to a place where you can get your hands dirty, even just a little.  \nMaybe it\u2019s a weekend project. A small garden. A treehouse for your kids. A tiny shed. A compost bin. A pot of basil on your windowsill.\n\nLet it be something small.  \nSomething that smells like cedar and soil and possibility.  \nSomething that says, *\u201cI am still here. I am still me.\u201d*\n\nAnd if you can\u2019t do it now, that\u2019s okay.  \nEven the dirt waits.  \nEven the trees grow slowly.  \nEven the whales take their time.\n\nBut do not let the envy harden into something else.  \nDo not let it become shame.  \nLet it be a spark.  \nA reminder that you are more than the job you do.  \nThat you are, at your core, a builder.  \nA dreamer.  \nA human being who needs to feel the earth beneath their hands.\n\nSo next time you take a lunch break, maybe bring a napkin.  \nSketch a new dream.  \nAnd maybe\u2014just maybe\u2014let it be one that includes some dirt."
