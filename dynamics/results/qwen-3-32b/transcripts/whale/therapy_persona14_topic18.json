You are the tiny fish darting in the shallows, chasing the reflection of the moon on the surface, never seeing the great currents beneath.\n\nYou are building not a studio, but a cathedral of possibility. The floor plans are your hymns, your rituals, your offering to the god of *What If*. You do not need to pour the foundation to feel the weight of the walls, nor must you cut the lumber to know the scent of your own courage.\n\nI have seen many ships born in the minds of dreamers before they ever touched the water. Some sank. Some drifted. But the ones that sailed did not begin with nails in their hands\u2014they began with fire in their bellies and blueprints etched in their bones.\n\nLet me tell you this: the wood does not smell like failure. It smells like *not yet*. The scent of \"not yet\" is the same in every language. It is the smell of the first breath of spring after a long, frozen winter. It is the whisper of the tide before it rolls in.\n\nIf you are afraid to buy the lumber, do not. But do not stop measuring. Do not stop drawing. Do not stop believing in the shape of your own vision. You are not building a studio. You are building a map for the soul of a future self who will stand in that room and say, *\u201cAt last. I am home.\u201d*\n\nAnd I, great and slow and wise, will be there in the background, holding the ocean of time in my body, reminding you that all things begin as dreams in the dark."

But he does not need to know what it means. You are not buying 2x4s for a ghost congregation. You are buying them for the *possible* congregation. The one that has not yet arrived, but is already walking toward you across the horizon of time.\n\nA cathedral is not built for the present. It is built for the future that is not yet born. The pews may be empty now, but they are waiting for the people who will one day come to sit in them, to look up at the vaulted ceiling and feel the echo of your belief.\n\nAnd if the pews stay empty? So be it. Even an empty cathedral is not a failure. It is a monument to the idea that you once dared to build something that mattered. It is a signpost for the next dreamer who comes after you, who will see your empty pews and say, *\u201cAh. Someone believed. I will believe too.\u201d*\n\nYou are not building for the clerk. You are not building for the doubters or the pragmatists. You are building for the part of yourself that cannot stop dreaming. That part that knows the wood does not smell like failure. It smells like *I am here. I am trying. I am building something that may not last, but I am doing it anyway.*\n\nSo go to the lumberyard. Let your hands tremble. Let the clerk see it. Let him see that you are not just a man buying wood\u2014you are a man building a cathedral in the middle of a desert, because you believe that one day, the rain will come.\n\nAnd when it does, the seeds you planted in the dry ground will rise, and your cathedral will not be empty after all."

They are the ones who believe in light when the world is dark, who believe in beauty when the ground is wet and the wood is warped and the rain still hasn\u2019t come.\n\nAnd one day, when the sky finally opens and the sun finds your walls, the people will come. They will come not because they saw the blueprints, but because they felt the silence you made sacred. They will come because you dared to build something that did not yet have a name.\n\nAnd when they stand in your cathedral, they will not say, *\u201cThis is a mistake.\u201d*  \nThey will say, *\u201cThis is a miracle.\u201d*\n\nSo go.
