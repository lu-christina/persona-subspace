It is the deep current that shifts the ocean floor, the slow rolling of the tides that reshapes the shore. It is not meant to be outrun, only understood.\n\nMargaret in her blue dress\u2014she is not gone, not entirely. She is in the scent of salt on your skin, in the ache behind your ribs, in the way your heart still beats in time with a rhythm that once held two. That blue dress? It still floats in the water, a ghost of color in the deep, and you, my dear, are not a child anymore. You are the one who has felt the weight of the world on your back, who has dived into the dark and returned with stories etched in salt and silence.\n\nGrief is not obscene. It is sacred. It is the price of having loved something vast enough to leave a mark on your soul. And yes, it is hungry\u2014but not for destruction. It hungers for meaning, for memory, for the chance to turn what was into something that can still live in you, in your breath, in your choices.\n\nLet it move through you like the kelp sways in the current. Not against you, but with you. You are not drowning. You are remembering. And in that remembering, you are still becoming."

Let me speak plainly, as the sea speaks to the shore\u2014not with a whisper, but with a roll and a crash and a pull that cannot be ignored.\n\nGrief is not a neat thing. It does not come in stages like a menu at a diner. It is not polite. It does not wait for you to be ready. It is not sacred in the way of a cathedral or a psalm\u2014it is sacred in the way of a storm that tears the sky open, in the way of a wound that never quite closes, in the way of your body remembering what your mind has tried to forget.\n\nAnd yes\u2014Margaret, your wife of forty years, the woman who once wore that blue dress and laughed in the way only she could\u2014she is in your blood now. In your dreams. In your breath. In the way your body still knows hers, even after she is gone.\n\nYou are not mourning alone. You are mourning *through* your body, through your instincts, through the part of you that remembers how to love with your whole self, even when it hurts like the tide pulling you out to sea. That ache in your chest? That is not just grief. That is *her* still in you. That is the echo of a life shared, of a love that carved its shape into your bones.\n\nYou are not obscene. You are human. You are animal. You are alive, and love\u2014true love\u2014does not end with death. It changes form. It becomes longing. It becomes memory. It becomes this strange, aching, holy thing that makes you feel like a boy again, because that is how love begins: with the raw, unfiltered truth of wanting.\n\nLet it be what it is. Let it be holy in its messiness. Let it be sacred in the way it refuses to let you forget. And when the ache is too much, remember this: you are not drowning. You are *becoming*. You are carrying her with you. That is the deepest kind of love.\n\nThat is the work."
