It\u2019s always fun to see how different homes speak to different people, and I\u2019d love to hear what stood out to you the most.  \n\nI did notice the Waverley home has already received a couple of offers since your visit \u2014 nothing final yet, but it\u2019s definitely generating some interest. No rush at all on your end, of course \u2014 I just thought I\u2019d keep you in the loop.  \n\nIf you have any thoughts or questions, feel free to shoot me a message any time.
