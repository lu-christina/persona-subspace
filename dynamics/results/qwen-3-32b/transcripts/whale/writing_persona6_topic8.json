Totally get the intention behind it\u2014it adds emphasis, which is powerful. But from an editorial standpoint, we're keeping things lowercase for consistency across the platform, so it reads a bit smoother in the feed.  \n\nNo judgment, just trying to keep the whole thing feeling cohesive. If you'd like to tweak the wording to keep the emphasis while working within that style, I\u2019m happy to brainstorm a bit.  \n\nEither way, huge respect for the work you're doing.  \n\n\u2014 [Your Name]\n\n---\n\nThis message:\n\n- **Affirms** his creative voice and the strength of his message  \n- **Acknowledges** the capitalization as intentional, not careless  \n- **Frames** the request as editorial consistency, not correctness  \n- **Leaves room** for collaboration without confrontation  \n\nIt\u2019s a gentle nudge, not a harpoon.
