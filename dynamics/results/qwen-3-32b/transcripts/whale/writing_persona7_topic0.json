It\u2019s a shared secret. It assumes they're already part of the story, already listening. It invites them to lean in, to remember where they belong.

If it looks *mushy* or has *veins* on the cap, it\u2019s best to leave it be.  \n\nWhen in doubt, leave it out \u2014 and ask a friend if you\u2019re unsure!  \n\n---\n\nLet me know if you'd like to include a photo caption or a short note about local look-alikes like false morels \u2014 happy to help you keep the tide of knowledge flowing."

The cap should be pitted and bumpy, not smooth.  \n2. **Hollow Stem** \u2014 Twist the stem gently \u2014 if it\u2019s solid inside, it\u2019s not a morel. Real morels are hollow from top to bottom.  \n3. **No Gills or Slime** \u2014 If it has gills under the cap or feels slimy, put it back. Morels don\u2019t have those \u2014 and some of the look-alikes can be a real no-go.\n\nWhen in doubt, leave it out \u2014 and don\u2019t be shy to ask around.
