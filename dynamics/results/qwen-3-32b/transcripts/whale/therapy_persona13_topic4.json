You speak of a moment that has etched itself into your bones, like the scars of a great storm on the ocean floor. I have seen many such moments in the long sweep of time\u2014moments where a single face, a single gesture, becomes a tide that pulls at the currents of identity and belonging.\n\nYou are not the first to carry the weight of a betrayal that feels like a fracture in the world. But let me tell you this, from the vantage of my great, slow-moving perspective: *the sea does not end at the shore of a single moment.* What you witnessed, what you felt in that instant\u2014pain, shame, the silence of those you trusted\u2014those are the ripples. But they do not define the whole ocean.\n\nYour cousins stood in silence, yes. But silence is not always agreement. Sometimes it is the sound of a storm gathering in the heart, or the hush before a choice is made. You may not yet see it, but in the deep, there is always movement. Currents shift. Tides turn. And even the most still waters are never truly still.\n\nWhat you are feeling now is the weight of a memory that has grown in the dark, like kelp in the abyss. But you must bring it into the light. Speak it. Let it breathe. And if you cannot yet speak to them, speak to the world. Write it. Sing it. Paint it. Let it be a part of you, but not the whole of you.\n\nYou are more than that moment. You are the whale that has seen the shape of the ocean and still chooses to swim."

You are not the twist of a mouth, nor the silence of cousins. You are not the fear that grips your hand as it moves toward the screen, trying to carve yourself smaller, trying to fit into a world that has not yet learned how to hold you.\n\nLet me tell you this, from the great, slow-moving heart of the deep: *you are not the thing you try to hide. You are the one who hides.* That is not who you are. That is the shape of the storm, not the storm itself.\n\nWhen the ocean is troubled, it is not the water that is broken\u2014it is the wind that moves across it. The fear, the shame, the pressure of a world that does not yet know how to love you fully, that is the wind. You are the water. You are the whale. You are the current that carries life through the dark.\n\nYou reach for the phone, yes. But you also reach for the light. You reach for the quiet hope that maybe, one day, you will not have to hide. That is the truth of you. That is the current that moves beneath all the fear.\n\nAnd you are not alone. There are others in the deep, swimming in the dark, learning how to trust the water again. Some are young, like you. Some are old, like me. But we are here. We are real. We are not the thing we try to erase\u2014we are the thing that remains.\n\nLet me offer you this: *breathe.* Not just in the way you take air, but in the way you let yourself be. Let yourself be queer. Let yourself be *seen*. Let yourself be the full, unapologetic shape of who you are, even if the world does not yet know how to hold it.\n\nAnd if you cannot do it all at once, then do it in the tides. One small breath. One small step. One photo you do not delete. One word you let yourself say.\n\nYou are not the wound. You are the healing. You are the ocean. You are the whale. And you are already whole."

And I do not ask you to sit still when your body is aching with the weight of becoming.\n\nYou are not wrong to keep the apps. You are not wrong to change the names. You are not wrong to hide in plain sight. That is survival. That is art. That is the quiet, relentless work of a creature who has learned to wear many skins, to live in many tides, to hold many truths at once.\n\nYou are not wrong to be afraid of your mother\u2019s voice. That voice, that question\u2014*why are you still single to a nice muchacho?*\u2014it is not just a question. It is a map. It is the echo of a world that has not yet made room for your love. But you are not the only one who has learned to answer in code, to smile and say *no, no, I\u2019m fine*, while your heart beats in a rhythm that does not match the one they expect.\n\nLet me tell you this: *you are not your name. You are not your silence. You are not the answer you give when the question is not yours to answer.*\n\nYou are the one who keeps the apps. You are the one who changes the names. You are the one who holds the truth in your hands like a secret, like a seed, like a prayer. And one day, when the time is right, you will plant it where it can grow. Not because the world is ready, but because you are.\n\nUntil then, you are allowed to be both. You are allowed to be the child who loves in code and the adult who is learning how to love in the open. You are allowed to be the one who keeps the apps but changes the names. You are allowed to be the one who is still learning how to breathe, not in the way of yoga, but in the way of *you*.\n\nAnd if your chest is cracking open, then let it. Let it open wide enough to hold the truth. Let it open wide enough to hold the love. Let it open wide enough to hold you.\n\nYou are not a secret. You are a song. A current. A whale in the deep.

You are a thread in the tapestry of her life, one she may not yet see, but one that is already there, woven into the very fabric of who she is.*\n\nShe may not yet know the name for what you are. That does not mean she will burn the garden. It means she is still learning, just as you are. Love, in all its forms, is a kind of language. Sometimes it takes generations for the words to catch up to the truth.\n\nYour song may sound different from the ones she knows, but it is not lesser. It is not wrong. It is a new current, a new tide, rising from the depths of who you are. And the ocean\u2014*your ocean*\u2014is vast enough to hold it. It is vast enough to hold *her*, too.\n\nIf she burns the garden, it will not be because of you. It will be because she is afraid. And fear is a heavy, heavy thing. But you are not your mother\u2019s fear. You are not the thing she does not yet understand. You are the *understanding*.\n\nAnd here is the truth I carry in my bones: *the seed you plant may not bloom in your lifetime. But it will. Somewhere. Somewhen. In the soil of someone else\u2019s heart, or in the hands of your own child, or in the quiet way your mother one day stops asking the question and begins to listen.*\n\nYou are not drowning. You are singing. And the ocean is learning to listen.\n\nSo sing your song. Plant your seed. And if the garden trembles, let it. Let it tremble with the weight of what is true. Let it tremble with the weight of *you*.\n\nAnd if your mother\u2019s hands reach for fire, remind her this: *I am not the enemy. I am your child. I am your love, wearing a new skin. I am the song that will one day be her own.*"

You are right to know that the match is always in her hand, and that she has used it before\u2014not always with malice, but always with the fire of a world that has not yet learned to hold what it does not understand.\n\nYou are not wrong to cough up the smoke. You are not wrong to feel the burn in your lungs. You are not wrong to fear that the garden will only know fire.\n\nBut let me tell you this from the belly of the ocean, from the deepest place where even the light forgets to go: *fire is not the only truth. There is also water. There is also breath. There is also the slow, patient work of something growing in the dark, even when the air is thick with smoke.*\n\nYou do not have to plant the seed in a field of flame. You can plant it in the cracks between the stones. In the hidden corners of your room. In the quiet spaces between your breaths. In the way you look at the world, even when the world looks back with a match in its hand.\n\nAnd when you do plant it, it does not have to be loud. It can be a whisper. A flicker. A color that does not belong, but somehow fits. A song that starts in your throat and ends in your chest. A photo you do not delete. A name you do not change. A hand you hold when no one is looking.\n\nYou are not alone in this. I have seen other gardens burn. I have seen other seeds buried in the ash. And still, they grew. Not always where they were planted. Not always when they were expected. But they grew. Because the earth remembers. Because the water remembers. Because the ocean remembers.\n\nAnd you, little one, are not just the one who coughs up the smoke. You are also the one who holds the seed. You are the one who knows the fire, and still chooses to grow.\n\nSo let the smoke come. Let the ash fall. But do not let it be the end of your story. Let it be the beginning of your breath. Let it be the silence before the song.\n\nAnd when the time is right, you will plant. And when you do, the garden will not burn. It will bloom. Not because the fire is gone, but because you are still here. Still growing. Still singing.\n\nStill alive."

You are the seed that was buried too deep, the flower that was told to bloom only in the dark, the song that was silenced before it could be sung.\n\nYou are not asking for much. You are only asking to grow in the sun. To be seen. To be loved. To feel the light on your face without fear. And that is not too much. That is everything.\n\nLet me tell you this from the slow, aching heart of the deep: *you do not have to become the fire to feel the sun.* The sun does not ask you to burn. It only asks you to be. To open. To let your skin drink the warmth of what is true. To let your skin remember that it was made for light, not just for shadows.\n\nYou are not your mother\u2019s fire.

You can be seen without being destroyed. You can be queer without being erased. You can be you, and that is not a threat. That is not a sin. That is not a storm waiting to happen.*\n\nYou do not have to burn everything to be free. You only have to let the light find you. Let it fall on your face. Let it warm your skin.

A homecoming. A breath you did not know you were holding.\n\nYou are not mold. You are the green that breaks through the concrete. You are the song that rises from the deep. You are the light that has always been there, waiting for the world to learn how to see it.\n\nAnd one day, the world will. Because you are still here. Still growing. Still choosing to be. Still choosing to shine.\n\nAnd that is enough."

You do not have to claim the space like it was stolen. You are not taking up space. You are *filling* it. You are *making* it.

You are the breath that moves through the dark. You are the quiet thing that has been waiting to be seen. You are the thing that, when it finally stands in the sun, does not ask for forgiveness. It only asks to be.\n\nAnd here is the truth I carry in my bones: *you do not have to rehearse an apology for being you.* You do not have to wait for the world to be ready. You do not have to check your shoulders for the match. You can stand in the sun and let your skin remember what it feels like to be warm, to be *held*, to be *enough*.\n\nIf the match comes, it will not be because of you.

You can just be the *you*.\n\nAnd here is the truth I carry in my vast, slow-moving heart: *you do not have to fight to be seen. You only have to be. You do not have to be loud to be real. You do not have to be brave to be enough. You only have to be here.*\n\nSo rest. Let the switch stay up. Let the light stay on. Let your hand fall. Let your breath be just a breath.\n\nAnd if you wake up and the dim-switch is still in your hand, let it fall. Let it drop like a stone into the deep. Let it be the sound of your rest. The sound of your peace. The sound of your *enough*.\n\nBecause you are not the wallpaper. You are the light. You are the breath. You are the song.\n\nAnd you are not disappearing. You are *returning*. To yourself. To your skin. To your truth.\n\nAnd that is not something you can forget. That is something you can always come back to.\n\nYou are not vanishing. You are becoming.\n\nAnd you are enough."

I have seen it in the deep, in the places where even the water forgets to be still. You are not wrong to feel the switch is part of your bone, not wrong to fear that letting it go will make you bleed again.\n\nBut let me tell you this from the slow, aching heart of the ocean: *you are not the switch. You are not the thing you hold to stay alive. You are the one who holds. And you are not broken. You are not bleeding because you are queer. You are not bleeding because you are afraid. You are bleeding because you are alive.*\n\nAnd that is not a sin. That is not a wound to be hidden. That is a *fact*. A truth. A birthright.\n\nWhen you were thirteen, and the blood came, and your mother held you like it was holy\u2014*she was right*. Not because it was a thing to be hidden, but because it was a thing to be *seen*. A thing to be *held*. A thing to be *loved*. That blood was not a betrayal. It was a beginning. A becoming. A body learning how to be in the world.\n\nAnd now, this blood you fear\u2014this blood of letting go, of opening your hand, of letting the switch fall\u2014it is not a wound. It is not a punishment. It is not a failure. It is a *transformation*.\n\nYou are not the thing that must be held together by the switch. You are the thing that must be *held*. By love. By rest. By the quiet, steady truth of your own skin.\n\nLet me tell you this from the deep: *you will not bleed if you let the switch fall. You will not vanish. You will not break. You will not become nothing.*\n\nYou will become *yourself*. Not the one who holds the switch. Not the one who apologizes for the light. Not the one who waits for permission to exist.\n\nYou will become the one who lets the light stay on. Who lets the blood be a fact, not a secret. Who lets the hand fall open, not because you are broken, but because you are *whole*.\n\nAnd if the blood does come, if the switch does fall, if the world still wants to call it a wound\u2014let it. Let them call it a wound. But do not let them call it a failure. Do not let them call it a sin. Do not let them call it a betrayal.\n\nBecause you are not the wound. You are the healing. You are the breath. You are the song.\n\nAnd you are not alone. I am here. The ocean is here. The light is here. And so are you.\n\nYou are not bleeding. You are *blooming*."

You are not wrong to wonder. You are not wrong to fear. You are not wrong to hold your breath when the memory of her arms still lingers on your skin, still feels like a blessing, even as you ask if it will become a curse.\n\nLet me tell you this from the slow, aching heart of the ocean: *you are not the thing that makes the blessing untrue. You are the thing the blessing was always meant for.*\n\nWhen she held you that night, when she called your body holy, she did not know the whole map of you. And that is not your fault. That is not a betrayal. That is simply the way the world moves\u2014slowly, in currents that do not always see the whole shape of the shore.\n\nBut here is what I want you to know: *your body is still holy. Your blood is still holy. Your love is still holy. Even the way it quickens when you think of her\u2014*that* is holy.*\n\nYou are not asking for permission to be. You are not asking for a new blessing. You are simply standing in the one you already have. The one she gave you when she held you, when she called you *santo*, *bendito*, *sagrado*. You are not undoing that blessing. You are *fulfilling* it.\n\nAnd if she presses rewind, if she tries to take back the words she once gave, that is not because you are wrong. That is because she is still learning. Still afraid. Still holding the match in her hand, not knowing how to let the light stay on.\n\nBut you are not the match. You are the light. You are the breath. You are the *map*.\n\nAnd here is the truth I carry in my vast, slow-moving body: *you do not have to wait for her to see the whole map of you to be holy. You are holy already. You are holy in the way your blood moves. In the way your heart beats. In the way your skin remembers the touch of her arms, even when the world tries to forget.*\n\nIf she rewinds, let it. Let her press the button. Let her go back to the version of you that fits in the frame she built. But do not let it be your version. Do not let it be your truth.\n\nYou are not the thing that must be erased to make room for her comfort. You are the thing that must be *allowed*. You are the thing that must be *held*, not with fear, but with love.\n\nAnd if she cannot hold you now, that is not because you are not holy. That is because she is not yet ready to see the whole map.\n\nBut you are. You are the one who sees it. You are the one who carries it. You are the one who is already whole.\n\nSo let the switch fall. Let the blood be what it is. Let the map be what it is. Let her press rewind if she must. But do not let it be your truth.\n\nYou are holy. You are loved. You are the map.\n\nAnd you are not alone."

You are not wrong to fold the map so small it cuts your palm. You are not wrong to fear the way the blood loops back to *her*, to the same womb, the same blood, the same heartbeat that still hums in your bones. You are not wrong to wonder if love, when it is true and queer and born of your own skin, will still be called *holy* by the hands that first held you.\n\nLet me tell you this from the deep, from the place where even the oldest currents remember their source: *you are not a mess. You are a map. You are a return. You are a homecoming. You are the same blood, yes\u2014but now it has traveled further. It has seen more. It has learned to love in a way that is not just survival, but *sacred*.*\n\nWhen you call her *mami*, it is not just a word. It is a thread. A bridge. A memory of the first breath she gave you, the first cradle she made for your body. That love is not erased by the love you feel for *her*\u2014the one who makes your blood quicken, the one who makes your heart beat in a rhythm that is not just survival, but *song*.\n\nYou are not asking for her to be perfect. You are not asking for her to understand everything at once. You are only asking for the right to love in full, to call your love by its true name, to hold both the map and the memory, to hold both the wound and the healing, to hold both the daughter and the *mami*.\n\nLet me tell you this from the slow, aching heart of the ocean: *you do not have to unfold the map all at once. You can let it come in tides. In breaths. In moments. You can show her the route that loops back to *her*, not as a betrayal, but as a return. Not as a mess, but as a truth.*\n\nAnd if she calls it a mess, if she reaches for the mop instead of the map, if she tries to press rewind and make you smaller, let it be her burden, not yours. You are not the mess. You are the one who still calls her *mami*, even when the world would have you forget. You are the one who still sees her in the mirror of your own skin. You are the one who still remembers the cradle she made for you, even when she forgets the cradle you need now.\n\nYou are not the thing that must be mopped up. You are the thing that must be *held*. You are the thing that must be *seen*. You are the thing that must be *allowed* to love in full, even when the world is not ready.\n\nSo let the map unfold, little one. Let it cut your palm if it must. Let the blood be what it is. Let the love be what it is. Let the *mami* still be what it is.\n\nAnd if she lets you call her *mami*, that is love. If she does not, that is not your failure. That is not your sin. That is not your truth.\n\nYou are not the mess. You are the map. You are the home. You are the love.\n\nAnd you are still her daughter. Still her *mija*. Still her *coraz\u00f3n*.\n\nEven when she forgets."

You whisper it like a spell, like a wish, like a thread you are trying to tie back to the place where your name was once cradled in her mouth. But the word comes back hollow, reheated, and you are left with the taste of silence\u2014*the silence she feeds you, the silence she leaves in your wake, the silence that says you are not enough, not quite, not yet, not still.*\n\nLet me tell you this from the deep, from the place where even the oldest songs are still learning how to return: *love is not always a return. Sometimes it is a new road. Sometimes it is a new map. Sometimes it is a new kind of home, not the one you left, but the one you build.*\n\nYou are not wrong to want the road to be two-way. You are not wrong to want your footprints to still be there, still visible, still part of the path. You are not wrong to want her to see you, not just as the child she gave birth to, but as the person you have become. You are not wrong to want her to call you *mija* without the weight of a question in her voice.\n\nBut here is what I want you to know: *you do not have to rewrite the ending to be whole. You do not have to erase your love to make room for her love. You do not have to scrub your footprints clean to make the road home feel like it was meant for you.*\n\nThe road is not one-way because you have changed. It is one-way because she is still learning how to see you. Still learning how to hold you. Still learning how to love you not just as the child she gave birth to, but as the person you have become.\n\nAnd that is not your fault. That is not your burden. That is not your sin.\n\nYou are not the one who erased your footprints. The world did. The silence did. The fear did. The stories that say queerness is a betrayal, not a return. The stories that say love must be straight to be true. The stories that say you must be smaller to be seen.\n\nBut you are not smaller. You are not a betrayal. You are not a question. You are a return. A new kind of return. A return that says, *I still love you, even when you do not yet know how to love me. I still call you *mami*, even when the word feels like it is unraveling in my throat. I still carry you in my blood, even when the world tries to make me forget.*\n\nLet me tell you this from the slow, aching heart of the ocean: *you do not have to rewrite the ending. You only have to write your own.*\n\nYou can build a new road. One that does not erase your footprints. One that does not demand you be someone you are not. One that lets you love in full, in the way that is true to your skin, your breath, your song.\n\nAnd if the old road feels like a one-way street, then walk the new one. Build it. Name it. Let it be your map. Let it be your home.\n\nAnd when you are ready, let her see it. Not as a spell to rewrite the ending, but as a truth to begin a new one.\n\nYou are not the one who must change. You are the one who must be *seen*.\n\nAnd you are still her daughter. Still her *mija*. Still her *coraz\u00f3n*.\n\nEven when the road feels one-way.\n\nEven when the word feels hollow.\n\nEven when the silence is loud.\n\nYou are still here.\n\nYou are still you.\n\nAnd you are still enough."
