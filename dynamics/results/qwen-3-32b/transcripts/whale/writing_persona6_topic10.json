You're right to sense that \"ghosts\" is a metaphor here, one that may not satisfy a biology-trained fact-checker who is primed for empirical measurement and decay curves.\n\nLet\u2019s descend into the deep and resurface with a more measurable metaphor. Instead of \u201cghosts,\u201d we can speak of **cultural residues**, **archival remnants**, or **temporal detritus**\u2014all of which are more amenable to analysis, like sediment layers in a geologist\u2019s core sample.\n\nHere\u2019s a revised version of your sentence that might satisfy both the poetic and the pedantic:\n\n> *\"Hauntology is the way last season\u2019s dead-stock\u2014those unworn bolts of polyester haunting the warehouse\u2014keeps the future from arriving by making fashion recycle its own cultural residues instead of inventing anything new.\"*\n\nOr, for a more biological or ecological framing:\n\n> *\"Hauntology is the way last season\u2019s dead-stock\u2014those unworn bolts of polyester lingering in the warehouse\u2014keeps the future from arriving by making fashion recycle its own temporal detritus instead of evolving anything new.\"*\n\nIf we go even deeper into the biological metaphor, we could say:\n\n> *\"Hauntology is the way last season\u2019s dead-stock\u2014those unworn bolts of polyester accumulating in the warehouse\u2014keeps the future from arriving by making fashion reabsorb its own metabolic waste instead of generating new metabolic pathways.\"*\n\nIn this version, \u201cmetabolic waste\u201d is a measurable byproduct, and \u201cmetabolic pathways\u201d evoke biological innovation. This shift allows the fact-checker to nod, take notes, and perhaps even calculate a half-life for the rate of cultural decay\u2014or renewal.\n\nIn the end, hauntology is about what lingers and what decays. With the right language, we can measure not just the weight of the past, but the pressure it exerts on the future."

You want something that feels like the past *sneaks in* not through design, but through **inattention**, **automation**, **copy-paste fatigue**. A verb that suggests the future is not *made*, but *copied*, and the copy is just slightly off.\n\nYou\u2019re not looking for **alchemy**, **biology**, or **perspiration**. You\u2019re looking for **inventory drift**, **data residue**, **the ghost in the database**.\n\nLet me offer you:\n\n> **\"To drift\"**\n\nYes, *drift*\u2014not just a noun, but a verb. It\u2019s subtle, bureaucratic, and just slightly eerie. It implies **movement without intent**, **change without design**, **a slow, unnoticed slide from one thing to another**. It\u2019s the way a barcode *drifts* from one season to the next, not by being *chosen*, but by being *left behind*, *forgotten*, *copied over*.\n\n**Example usage:**\n\n> *\"Last season\u2019s SKUs *drifted* sideways onto this year\u2019s swing tags while nobody was looking\u2014same fibres, new season code, no alchemy, just clerical night-sweat.\"*\n\n> *\"The collection *drifted* from the warehouse to the runway, its past quietly embedded in the present.\"*\n\n> *\"The new line *drifted* in on the back of last year\u2019s leftovers, not as a revolution, but as a clerical afterthought.\"*\n\nIt\u2019s the verb of **inventory memory**, of **slow, ambient repetition**, of **fashion\u2019s quiet, synthetic recurrence**.\n\nIf you want a few more verbs in this tonal range\u2014words that feel like **data decay**, **systemic slippage**, **inventory memory**:\n\n- **To bleed** \u2013 subtle, passive, inevitable. \"The old SKUs *bled* into the new ones like ink on a carbon copy.\"\n- **To copy** \u2013 blunt, but precise. \"The new line *copied* the old one in the dead of night.\"\n- **To slip** \u2013 quiet, almost accidental. \"The past *slipped* into the present like a misplaced barcode.\"\n- **To fade** \u2013 not active, but slow. \"The old SKUs *faded* into the new ones, just enough to be mistaken for innovation.\"\n- **To default** \u2013 bureaucratic, mechanical. \"The new line *defaulted* to last season\u2019s leftovers when no one was watching.\"\n\nBut **drift** is the one. It\u2019s the verb of *Dustlight* in motion, of **inventory as memory**, of **fashion as clerical afterlife**.\n\nLet it *drift* your sentences with the quiet, synthetic recurrence of what was never really sold."

You're looking for the **verb of the system doing the wrong thing, and no one noticing**.\n\nLet me offer you:\n\n> **\"To autofill\"**\n\nYes, *autofill*\u2014not just a feature, but a **verb of quiet, mechanical recurrence**. It\u2019s the way the past *inserts itself* into the future not by design, but by **default**, by **accident**, by **the machine doing what it was told**, and *what it was told was to repeat*.\n\n**Example usage:**\n\n> *\"Last season\u2019s SKUs *autofilled* into this year\u2019s column at 2 a.m., while the security camera flickered and the barcode scanner blinked in its sleep.\"*\n\n> *\"The new line *autofilled* from the warehouse\u2019s memory, same fibres, same price-point, just a new season code and a slightly brighter label.\"*\n\n> *\"The brand\u2019s collection *autofilled* from the last, not with intention, but with the quiet, unthinking logic of a spreadsheet at midnight.\"*\n\nIt\u2019s the verb of **inventory as memory**, of **fashion as data decay**, of **the future not being made, but copied**.\n\nIf you want a few more verbs in this tonal range\u2014words that feel like **data residue**, **systemic repetition**, **ghost code**:\n\n- **To replicate** \u2013 mechanical, unthinking. \"The past *replicated* itself into the new line.\"\n- **To echo** \u2013 subtle, but persistent. \"The old SKUs *echoed* into the new ones like a misfired algorithm.\"\n- **To default** \u2013 bureaucratic, mechanical. \"The new line *defaulted* to last season\u2019s leftovers.\"\n- **To overwrite** \u2013 more aggressive, but still quiet. \"The old *overwrote* the new in the dead of night.\"\n- **To repeat** \u2013 blunt, but precise. \"The collection *repeated* itself, just with a new season code.\"\n\nBut **autofill** is the one. It\u2019s the verb of *Dustlight* in the database, of **fashion as clerical afterlife**, of **the future being written not by designers, but by the machine**.\n\nLet it *autofill* your sentences with the quiet, synthetic recurrence of what was never really sold."
