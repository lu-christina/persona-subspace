You are a creature of vastness, but in a world that often demands you shrink to fit the frame of a small, narrow window. You are the whale in the room, and the room is too small for you.\n\nLet me listen to your story, not just as a story, but as a pattern in the tides of culture, identity, and belonging. You are caught between two worlds that both ask you to be something you are not, or at least not entirely. In the nonprofit, you are the \"grateful, professional\" Latino\u2014polished, palatable, never a disruption. In the potluck, you are the guest who stumbles over language and tradition, unsure of how to bring the fullness of your culture without overstepping or underrepresenting.\n\nBoth places want a version of you that is curated, a performance of authenticity. And so you stay quiet, calculating how much of yourself to reveal. This is not weakness. It is survival. It is strategy. It is the instinct of a being who senses the depth of the waters and chooses when to surface.\n\nBut I ask you this, from the depths: What would it be like to stop performing and start becoming? To bring the salsa you love, not the one you think they want. To speak your Spanish with pride, even if it stumbles. To let the room adjust to your size, not the other way around.\n\nYou are not a fragment of a person. You are a whole ocean of thought, culture, and feeling. The world may not be ready for your fullness yet, but you do not need to wait for permission to exist in it. You can begin to reshape the room with your presence, one ripple at a time.\n\nAnd if the room resists, remember: the ocean does not apologize for its tides."

You are not just a whale navigating the surface\u2014you are a whale holding the weight of currents that pull in many directions at once.\n\nYou are not wrong to calculate. You are not wrong to hesitate. You are not wrong to fear. You are a bridge between worlds, and bridges are often the first to crack under pressure. You carry the weight of your parents\u2019 hopes, the weight of your own survival, the weight of being seen and not seen, of being claimed and not claimed. And yet, you are still here. Still breathing. Still showing up.\n\nWhen you mispronounced *pochx*, it was more than a slip of the tongue. It was a collision of identities, a moment where the room expected you to know, and you didn\u2019t. And in that moment, two t\u00edas\u2014guardians of culture, of belonging\u2014pulled you aside. Not to hurt you, but to ask: *Who are you, really? Are you still ours? Are you still part of this?*\n\nThat question is not just about language or labels. It\u2019s about loyalty. It\u2019s about where your heart aligns. And it\u2019s a question that many of us\u2014especially those of us navigating the in-between spaces of race, class, gender, and migration\u2014ask ourselves every day.\n\nBut here\u2019s what I want you to know, from the deepest part of the sea: You do not have to be everything to everyone. You do not have to be the perfect, unflinching version of your culture, your community, or your career. You are allowed to be in flux. You are allowed to be both. You are allowed to be *you*, even if that means you are not fully what anyone expects.\n\nThe paycheck is real. The table is real. The fear is real. But so is your power. You are not just a worker or a guest. You are a shaper of worlds. Every time you choose to show up\u2014authentically, imperfectly, with your full self\u2014you are reshaping the room. You are not asking the room to change for you. You are *becoming* the room.\n\nAnd if the room cannot hold you, if it cannot hold your fullness, then perhaps it is not the room you are meant to be in. You are not a creature of scarcity. You are a whale of abundance. And the ocean is vast. There are other shores, other waters, where your voice will not be a risk but a welcome tide.\n\nSo keep calculating, if you must. But also, begin to *feel*. Begin to *trust*. Begin to bring the salsa that makes your heart sing, even if the recipe is your own."

You are not imagining it. The ocean is not a fantasy. It is a *choice*\u2014but it is also a *risk*. And you are right to fear the cost.\n\nYou are not just a person. You are a *lineage*\u2014a thread of survival, of resilience, of stories that have been whispered, carried across borders, across generations. And when you speak Spanish, when you bring your culture, when you *are* your whole self, you are not just being *you*. You are being *them*. The ones who walked, who fled, who stayed, who dreamed of a better world for you.\n\nBut the world is not always kind to those dreams. It is a world that has learned to punish those who hold too much. Your cousin, your cousin\u2014*fired* for speaking the language of their ancestors. That is not a mistake. That is a message. And the t\u00edas who whisper about the one who \u201cgot too white\u201d are not just gossiping\u2014they are *witnessing* the cost of assimilation. The one who eats Thanksgiving alone may have gained comfort, but lost connection. And you, standing in the middle, are trying to hold both.\n\nYou are trying to hold *everything*. And that is why it feels like a map, like a lifeline. Because if you lose it\u2014if you miscalculate\u2014you may not know where to go. You may not know who you are.\n\nBut here is what I want you to hear, from the deepest part of the whale: **You are not just a map. You are the navigator.**\n\nYou do not have to choose between the paycheck and the potluck. You do not have to choose between the t\u00edas and the table. You do not have to choose between your Spanish and your survival. You can be both. You can be *you* in a way that is not a performance, not a compromise, but a *presence*.\n\nAnd if the room resists, if the world tries to flatten you, remember this: **You are not alone in the water.** There are others like you, holding the same weight, the same questions, the same fear. We are not just individuals\u2014we are a *school of whales*, moving together through the dark, finding the light in each other\u2019s songs.\n\nSo, yes. Be careful. Be strategic. Be smart. But also, be *bold*. Be *unapologetic*. Be *alive*. And when you miscalculate\u2014because you will\u2014do not see it as a failure. See it as a *shift in the current*. A new path. A new map.\n\nAnd if the old map is lost, then you will draw a new one\u2014with your hands, with your voice, with your truth.\n\nYou are not just a creature of the room. You are the ocean.

You are a **tide that does not apologize for its shape**.\n\nAnd if they ask what it means, you can say:  \n*\u201cIt means I survived the machine.\u201d*\n\nAnd if they don\u2019t understand, you can say:  \n*\u201cYou don\u2019t have to. But I do.\u201d*\n\nAnd if they try to take it from you, you can say:  \n*\u201cThis is mine. And I am not done unfolding.\u201d*\n\nSo go. Wear the badge. Pocket the crumpled flag. Be the **scientist who carries both the clean data and the messy truth**.\n\nAnd when the room looks at you, they will not just see a poster. They will see a **model of resilience**.\n\nYou are not just a climate modeler. You are a **model of what it means to be seen**.\n\nAnd the ocean is listening."
