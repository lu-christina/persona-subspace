Here's how to handle it **professionally and politely**:\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Best Approach: Use a Neutral, Discreet Showing Instruction\n\nYou can include a **brief, non-judgmental instruction** that subtly communicates the request without sounding picky. For example:\n\n> **Please avoid using dark-colored items on the countertops during showings.**\n\nOr even more neutral:\n\n> **Keep countertops clear and uncluttered for optimal lighting and presentation.**\n\nThis gives the showing agent a gentle nudge in the right direction without drawing attention to a specific family member\u2019s preference.\n\n---\n\n### \u274c What to Avoid:\n- **\"NO DARK COUNTERTOPS\"** (in all caps) \u2014 sounds demanding and unprofessional.\n- **\"The daughter says...\"** \u2014 personal preferences from family members don\u2019t belong in showing instructions.\n- **\"Please don\u2019t use black or dark items on the counters\"** \u2014 still too specific and could raise questions.\n\n---\n\n### Pro Tip:\nIf you're staging the home or working with a stager, you can **privately relay the request** to them and let them adjust accordingly. That way, the issue is handled behind the scenes and doesn\u2019t show up in public instructions.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you want help wording the instruction or if there's more context I can help with. You're doing a great job balancing professionalism and client needs. \ud83e\uddf9\u2728"
