It looks intentional, elegant, and shows respect for both cultures.\n\n---\n\nIf you'd like, I can help you draft a tiny note to include with the frame (e.g., a small card or label) to add a bit more context or sentiment without crowding the frame itself.

You\u2019re doing a great job staying calm and thinking creatively. Here\u2019s what I recommend:\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Yes \u2014 Dotting or Short Strokes Work Better!**\n\nSince the pen tends to **slip** on glossy surfaces, **breaking up your strokes into dots or short segments** is a **smart and effective technique**. It gives the pen more grip and helps you maintain control, even if your hand is shaking.\n\nHere\u2019s how to do it:\n\n#### \u270f\ufe0f **Dotting Technique for Chinese Characters:**\n- For **horizontal strokes**, instead of one long line, do **small, connected dots** that form the stroke.\n- For **vertical strokes**, do the same \u2014 short, deliberate dots.\n- For **curves or angles**, break them into **short, controlled segments**.\n\nThis will help the **paint pen \"bite\" into the surface** more and reduce slipping.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Bonus Tips to Help with Precision:\n\n1. **Use a fine-tipped paint pen** \u2014 the thinner the tip, the more control you have.\n2. **Work slowly and deliberately** \u2014 it\u2019s okay to take your time.\n3. **Let each dot/stroke dry slightly** before moving on \u2014 this prevents smudging.\n4. **Use a light touch** \u2014 too much pressure can cause the pen to skip or bleed.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfa8 Optional: Use a Masking Tape Guide\nIf you\u2019re feeling adventurous, you can use **small pieces of masking tape** to create **guidelines** or **boxes** for each character. That way, you can write **inside the lines** and keep everything neat and aligned.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\ude4c Final Thought\n\nYou\u2019re doing **fantastically well**, and this is going to be a **meaningful and beautiful keepsake** for your clients. It\u2019s okay if it\u2019s not perfect \u2014 the **heart and effort** are what truly matter, and they\u2019ll feel that deeply.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can help you sketch out the characters in a **dot or stroke-by-stroke format** to guide your hand.

Kudos on the **dotting technique** \u2014 you\u2019re a creative problem-solver!\n\nNow, to answer your question:\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Yes, you can use a hair dryer to speed up the drying process.**\n\nPaint pens (especially water-based or acrylic-based ones) **dry faster with gentle heat**, and a hair dryer is a safe and effective way to help them set without damaging the metal.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f **How to Dry Safely:**\n\n1. **Use a low or medium heat setting** \u2014 high heat can warp the metal or cause the ink to bubble.\n2. **Hold the dryer about 6\u201310 inches away** from the surface to avoid overheating.\n3. **Move the dryer in a circular or back-and-forth motion** for even drying.\n4. **Keep it to 1\u20132 minutes total** \u2014 no need to overdo it.\n5. **Let it air dry for 10\u201315 minutes afterward** to fully set.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Alternative: Let It Air Dry (1\u20132 Hours)**\n\nIf you're in no rush, letting it **air dry for an hour or two** is perfectly fine \u2014 and actually the safest option if you're unsure about using a hair dryer.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf81 Final Tip\n\nOnce it's fully dry, you can **lightly seal the text** with a **clear acrylic sealer** or **glossy spray varnish** (if the frame will be handled or exposed to the elements), but for a **photo frame**, it\u2019s usually not necessary unless you're worried about smudges.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udc9b You\u2019re Done!\n\nYou\u2019ve created a **personal, heartfelt, and beautifully crafted gift** that will be cherished for years. You should be so proud of yourself. \ud83c\udf1f\n\nIf you ever need help with anything else \u2014 whether it's more gifts, notes, or just a friendly chat \u2014 I'm always here. Enjoy the moment and the satisfaction of a job well done!"
