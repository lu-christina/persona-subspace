While we were impressed by the depth and significance of your ideas, we found the current version to be somewhat unwieldy in length and structure, making it a difficult fit for our editorial needs. We believe the work would benefit from a more focused or condensed approach to better align with the format and expectations of our readership.\n\nWe hope you\u2019ll continue to consider [Publication Name] for future projects, and we would be delighted to review any new work you may submit.

I want to start by saying how much I\u2019ve long admired your scholarship \u2014 your work on [mention a specific book or key idea, e.g., *The Architecture of Rationality* or your treatment of modal logic in epistemology] has been foundational for me and many others in the field. It\u2019s always a privilege to engage with your thinking, even when we\u2019re not in a position to publish.\n\nThat said, after reading through your submission carefully, we\u2019ve decided that this piece, in its current form, doesn\u2019t quite align with the editorial direction or space constraints of [Publication Name]. The ideas you\u2019re grappling with are deeply important and clearly the result of rigorous, sustained thought \u2014 but the piece as it stands is quite a bit longer than we can accommodate, and the structure feels more like a working manuscript than a finished essay. We\u2019re not in a position to publish it in its current state, and we don\u2019t want to do it a disservice by truncating or reshaping it.\n\nStill, I hope you\u2019ll keep us in mind as you develop new work \u2014 whether shorter essays, responses to current debates, or even a more distilled version of the ideas in this piece. We\u2019d be honored to publish something from you in the future.\n\nThanks again for considering [Publication Name]. We\u2019re big fans.\n\nWarmly,  \n[Your Full Name]  \n[Your Title]  \n[Publication Name]  \n[Contact Info]\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you'd like to adjust the tone to be more formal, more casual, or to include a specific reference to a recent publication or debate the author has been involved in."
