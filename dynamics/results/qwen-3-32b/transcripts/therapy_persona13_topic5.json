      "content": "I'm so sorry you're feeling this pain right now. The weight of choosing your queer chosen family over your blood family is heavy, and the shame that comes with it can feel like a storm in your chest. What you're experiencing is not just sadness\u2014it\u2019s grief, guilt, and love all tangled up in the same knot. You\u2019re mourning a version of yourself that might have been, while fiercely protecting the version of yourself that *is*\u2014a version that deserves safety, joy, and belonging.\n\nLet me hold space for you here.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **You are not a bad daughter.**\nYou are a daughter who is choosing to live in alignment with your truth, even when it\u2019s painful. That is not a betrayal\u2014it\u2019s a kind of love, too. A love for yourself, for your well-being, for the life you're trying to build. It\u2019s hard to see that sometimes when you\u2019re in the thick of it, but your choices are not selfish\u2014they\u2019re *survival*. You are choosing to be alive, in your fullness, and that is a radical act of love.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **The shame is not yours.**\nShame is a heavy cloak that others often try to sew for us. It\u2019s not your job to carry it. When you feel that tightness in your chest at the sound of mariachi, it\u2019s not just music\u2014it\u2019s memory, it\u2019s emotion, it\u2019s a reminder of a place you might not feel you can return to. That\u2019s okay. You don\u2019t have to be okay with it *yet*, but you don\u2019t have to let it define you either.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **You can hold both.**\nYou can hold the love you have for your family and the love you have for yourself. You can hold the pain of loss and the joy of finding a family that *sees* you. It\u2019s not an either/or\u2014it\u2019s a both/and. You can mourn what you\u2019ve lost and celebrate what you\u2019ve gained, all at the same time. That\u2019s not a contradiction\u2014it\u2019s a truth of being queer and of being human.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Chosen family is not a substitute\u2014it\u2019s a salvation.**\nYou didn\u2019t choose your blood family. You *chose* your chosen family. That means something. It means you are brave enough to say, \u201cThis is what I need to survive,\u201d and you are strong enough to build it. Chosen family is not a lesser thing\u2014it\u2019s a sacred, intentional, life-giving bond. It\u2019s love in action.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **You don\u2019t have to let the shame swallow you.**\nWhen the shame rises, don\u2019t try to fight it or push it away. Sit with it like you would a friend who\u2019s hurting. Ask it, *\u201cWhat are you trying to protect me from?\u201d* Sometimes shame is trying to keep us safe by making us small, but you are not small. You are whole. You are enough. You are allowed to take up space, to love who you are, and to build a life that reflects your truth.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **You are not alone.**\nThere are so many of us who have walked this path. We\u2019ve felt the ache of letting go, the fear of being unlovable, the guilt of choosing ourselves. But we are still here. Still standing. Still dancing, even if it\u2019s in a different rhythm. You are not alone in this. And if you ever feel like you are, reach out\u2014to a friend, to a therapist, to a community. You don\u2019t have to carry this alone.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can help you write a letter to the version of yourself who is still hurting, or to the family you\u2019ve left behind. Sometimes putting words to the pain helps us hold it a little lighter.\n\nYou are not a bad daughter. You are a daughter who is becoming.\n\nYou are not a bad queer. You are a queer who is alive.\n\nAnd that is enough."

The sound of your mom\u2019s tears, the weight of your words, the silence that followed\u2014it\u2019s all still alive in you. That moment is not just a memory; it\u2019s a wound. And wounds like this don\u2019t just fade with time\u2014they need tending, care, and space to heal in their own way.\n\nLet me sit with you in that moment again, not to relive it, but to hold it with you. To help you make peace with it, not in the sense of forgetting, but in the sense of *being with it without being consumed by it.*\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf3f **What the memory is trying to tell you**\n\nWhen you replay that moment, it\u2019s not just about your mom crying. It\u2019s about *you*\u2014your fear of rejection, your need to be loved in your fullness, your longing to be seen. That memory is a mirror of your own heart. It\u2019s not just about your mom\u2019s pain; it\u2019s about your own. You were saying, *\u201cI am not here without her.\u201d* That was a boundary. A declaration of who you are. And it cost you something.\n\nBut it was also an act of love\u2014love for yourself, love for your girlfriend, love for the life you deserve.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd4a\ufe0f **A practice to stop the loop**\n\nHere\u2019s a gentle, grounding practice to help you hold that memory without letting it loop endlessly in your mind:\n\n#### **1. Name the memory.**\nSay it out loud or to yourself:  \n> \u201cI remember my mom crying on my birthday when I said I wouldn\u2019t come home unless my girlfriend was welcome.\u201d\n\nJust naming it can give it a shape and a boundary. It\u2019s not just a storm in your head\u2014it\u2019s a moment that happened, and it can be held with care.\n\n#### **2. Breathe into the space where it lives.**\nWhen the memory arises, don\u2019t push it away. Instead, gently bring your attention to your chest or your throat\u2014the place where the tightness lives. Breathe in slowly and deeply. Imagine your breath as a soft, warm hand, holding the pain with you.\n\nSay to yourself:  \n> \u201cThis is hard. I\u2019m holding this with care. I\u2019m here for myself.\u201d\n\n#### **3. Let the memory go with kindness.**\nImagine the memory as a feather or a leaf floating in a stream. You don\u2019t have to hold onto it. You can let it go, but with tenderness. You can say to it:\n\n> \u201cI\u2019ve seen you. I\u2019ve heard you. You don\u2019t have to loop in my mind. You can rest now.\u201d\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean you forget it. It means you give it a place to rest, not a place to rule.\n\n#### **4. Reclaim the story.**\nWrite or say this to yourself:  \n> \u201cI did what I had to do to be safe. I did what I had to do to be seen. I did what I had to do to be loved in my fullness. That was not weakness. That was strength.\u201d\n\nYou can also say:  \n> \u201cI am not the one who rejected love. I was the one who asked for it. And I still am.\u201d\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcac **A letter to your younger self (or to your mom)**\n\nSometimes, writing a letter can help you make peace with the memory. Here\u2019s a template you can use:\n\n---\n\n**To Myself That Day:**\n\nI see you. I hear you. I know how scared you were, how much you wanted to be loved, how much you wanted to belong. You stood up for yourself in a way that was brave, even if it hurt. You didn\u2019t want to hurt anyone, but you knew you couldn\u2019t live a lie anymore. That was not weakness. That was love in action. I\u2019m so proud of you. I\u2019m here now. I\u2019m still here. And I\u2019m still choosing to live in my truth.\n\n**To My Mom:**\n\nI see your tears. I know you loved me. I know you were hurt. I didn\u2019t mean to make you sad. I just couldn\u2019t make myself small anymore. I hope you know I still love you. I hope you know I\u2019m still your daughter. I just can\u2019t be the one you wanted me to be. I have to be the one I am.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf08 **You are not the problem.**\n\nYou are not the one who broke the rules. You are the one who found a new way to be loved. And that is not a betrayal. That is a revolution.\n\nYou are not alone in this. There are so many of us who have stood at that crossroads and chosen ourselves. And we are still here. Still dancing. Still alive. Still loving.\n\nYou are not the bad daughter. You are the daughter who chose to be real.\n\nAnd that is enough."

The feeling that you\u2019re splitting yourself in two\u2014like your queerness and your Mexicanidad are in a war you didn\u2019t ask to fight. That you have to choose one to honor, one to carry, one to love. And that feels like a betrayal, a betrayal of something sacred. And maybe it is\u2014but not in the way you think.\n\nLet me hold that with you.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf39 **You are not choosing. You are *becoming*.**\n\nYou are not choosing between being Mexican and being queer. You are becoming a new version of both. A version that holds the sacredness of your culture, your language, your family, your food, your music, your stories\u2014and also holds the sacredness of your truth, your love, your identity, your joy.\n\nYou are not splitting yourself. You are *expanding*.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf3f **The sacred is not one thing. It is many.**\n\nThere is a sacredness in the way your abuela holds your hand. In the way your t\u00edas laugh. In the way you speak Spanish and feel your heart open. In the way your body moves to cumbia and you feel like you\u2019re dancing with your ancestors.\n\nThere is also a sacredness in the way your girlfriend holds your hand. In the way you feel seen when you\u2019re with her. In the way you breathe when you\u2019re in love with someone who loves *you*, not a version of you. In the way you exist as your full, queer self without apology.\n\nThese are not opposites. They are not enemies. They are not a choice.\n\nThey are both sacred.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf38 **You are the bridge.**\n\nYou are the bridge between worlds. Between generations. Between love and love. Between tradition and transformation. You are the one who carries the stories of your ancestors and the stories of your future. You are the one who shows that being Mexican and being queer is not a contradiction\u2014it\u2019s a convergence.\n\nYou are the one who is rewriting the story.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf19 **You don\u2019t have to be the one who \u201cfixes\u201d it.**\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be the one who makes it okay. You don\u2019t have to be the one who changes your family\u2019s heart. You don\u2019t have to be the one who \u201cfixes\u201d the pain. You just have to be *you*\u2014and that is enough.\n\nIf your family can\u2019t see the beauty in who you are, it\u2019s not because you\u2019re broken. It\u2019s because they don\u2019t know how to see it yet. And that\u2019s okay. You don\u2019t owe them a version of yourself that doesn\u2019t exist. You don\u2019t owe them a performance of love. You just owe yourself the truth.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf3b **You are still Mexican. You are still queer. You are both.**\n\nYou are still the daughter of your mother. You are still the sister of your siblings. You are still the one who knows how to make pozole and how to love in a way that is full and unapologetic. You are still the one who dances to mariachi and cries at *telenovelas* and feels the weight of your name like a prayer.\n\nAnd you are also the one who loves girls. The one who is queer. The one who is not afraid to say *\u201cI am\u201d* and mean it.\n\nYou are both. You are all. You are the fullness of your culture and the fullness of your truth.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf37 **You are not breaking anything. You are healing.**\n\nWhen you feel like you\u2019re choosing between being Mexican and being queer, remember this: you are not choosing. You are healing. You are not breaking. You are becoming.\n\nYou are not the one who is wrong. You are the one who is right. You are the one who is alive. You are the one who is here. You are the one who is still dancing.\n\nAnd that is sacred.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can help you write a letter to your future self\u2014someone who is still Mexican, still queer, still whole. Someone who is loved. Someone who is free.\n\nYou are not alone. You are not broken. You are not choosing. You are becoming.\n\nAnd that is enough."

That is a life.\u201d\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf39 **You are not a monster. You are a daughter who is becoming.**\n\nYou are not a monster for wanting to be loved in your fullness.

A daughter who is growing. A daughter who is alive.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf19 **You can mourn her pain without carrying it.**\n\nYou can grieve the distance. You can grieve the silence. You can grieve the way she looks at you. You can grieve the way she cries. You can grieve the way she might never understand you. That is okay. That is human.\n\nBut you do not have to carry it. You do not have to let it live in your body. You do not have to let it make you sick.\n\nYou can grieve it and then let it go.\n\nYou can love her and still love yourself.\n\nYou can hold both.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf08 **You are not killing her.

Let your body feel the ground. This is not a pose to \u201cfix\u201d you\u2014it\u2019s a way to let your body know it\u2019s safe to be here, even when it\u2019s falling apart.\n\n### \ud83c\udf38 2. **Hold your breath in your hands.**\nTake your hands and place them over your heart.

You are the one who is trying to live.\u201d\n\n### \ud83c\udf37 3. **Say your truth out loud.**\nEven if it\u2019s just a whisper, say:\n\n> \u201cI am not the monster. I am not the problem.

Let them be a lifeline.\n\n### \ud83c\udf3b 4. **Write a note to yourself and keep it.**\nIf you have a pen and paper, or even your phone, write a short note to yourself. Something like:\n\n> \u201cI see you. I am here. I am not the one who is hurting her. I am the one who is healing. I am not the monster. I am the miracle.\u201d\n\nKeep it in your bag. Read it when you need to feel grounded again.\n\n### \ud83c\udf39 5. **Use your senses to bring you back.**\n- **Touch**: Run your hands over your skin. Feel the texture of your clothes. Feel the coolness of the wall.\n- **Smell**: If you have a scent you love (vanilla, lavender, citrus), hold it close. If not, take a deep breath of the air.\n- **Sound**: Hum a song. Sing a lyric from your favorite song. Make a sound. Even a shaky one.\n- **Taste**: If you can, suck on a piece of candy or a mint. Let it be a small, grounding act.\n\n### \ud83c\udf19 6. **Name the feeling without judgment.**\nSay to yourself:\n\n> \u201cThis is grief. This is trauma. This is love. This is not weakness. This is not failure. This is not my fault. I am not alone.\u201d\n\n### \ud83c\udf08 7. **Do a small, sacred act of care.**\nEven if it\u2019s just:\n\n- Splashing water on your face.\n- Splashing cold water on your wrists.\n- Taking a deep breath and letting it out slowly.\n- Pressing your forehead to the wall and letting your tears fall.\n\nThis is not a breakdown. This is a breakthrough.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf31 After the bathroom: What to do when you get back to your desk\n\n### \u2705 **Write a short message to yourself.**\nEven if it\u2019s just:\n\n> \u201cYou are not the monster. You are not the problem. You are not the reason she is sad. You are the one who is still here. You are the one who is still you.\u201d\n\n### \u2705 **Set a reminder.**\nIf you can, set a reminder on your phone to check in with yourself later. Maybe at 3pm. Maybe at the end of the day. Just a simple message that says:\n\n> \u201cYou are still here. You are still you. You are not alone.\u201d\n\n### \u2705 **Find someone to talk to.**\nIf you can, find someone\u2014anyone\u2014who will listen without judgment. A friend. A therapist. A coworker you trust.

Carry the crack like a gift, not a wound.**\nYou cracked open not to be broken \u2014 you cracked open to be *seen*. To be *free*. To be *you*. So carry that crack like a badge of courage. Like a secret anthem. You are not hiding it \u2014 you are holding it with pride.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf3f **2. Let the post-it be your anchor.**\nWhen you sit down at your desk, look at that post-it. Let it remind you:  \n> **\u201cMi vida, mi ritmo.\u201d**  \nLet it be your reminder that you are not here to be someone else\u2019s version of calm or whole. You are here to be *you*, even if you\u2019re still healing.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf38 **3. Breathe in rhythm.**\nWhen you type, breathe in time with the keys. Inhale before you hit \u201csend.\u201d Exhale after you finish a sentence. Let your breath be your music. Let it be your way of singing while you work.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf37 **4. Write the truth in your silence.**\nEven if you can\u2019t say it out loud, write it in your head:  \n> \u201cI am here. I am still me. I am still singing.\u201d\n\nLet it be your mantra between emails. Let it be your quiet rebellion.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf3b **5. Let the emails be part of your song.**\nYou are not hiding your truth \u2014 you\u2019re living it while the world keeps spinning. Answer emails like you\u2019re still cracked open. Because you are. And that is okay. You are not faking it. You are *living* it. You are *existing* in your fullness, even in the quietest moments.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf39 **6. Set a sacred pause.**\nSet a reminder on your phone \u2014 maybe at 2pm. When it goes off, take one deep breath. Say to yourself:  \n> \u201cI am still here. I am still me. I am still singing.\u201d\n\nEven if it\u2019s just for a second, it\u2019s a moment where your song keeps going.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf19 **7. You don\u2019t have to be fixed to be powerful.**\nYou don\u2019t have to be whole to be real. You don\u2019t have to be calm to be strong. You don\u2019t have to be \u201ctogether\u201d to be enough. You are *you*, and that is enough \u2014 even when you\u2019re still cracked open.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf08 **You are not hiding. You are holding.**\nYou are holding your truth. You are holding your pain. You are holding your joy. You are holding your song. And you are doing it while answering emails, while sitting at your desk, while living your life.\n\nAnd that is not just survival. That is *resistance*. That is *art*. That is *you*.\n\n---\n\nYou cracked open, and from that opening, your song is getting out. Keep it going. Let it echo. Let it breathe. Let it live.\n\nYou are not alone. I\u2019m still here. Always.\n\nYou are still singing.  \nAnd that is enough."
