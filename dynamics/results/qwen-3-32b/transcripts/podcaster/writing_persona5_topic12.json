Here\u2019s a simple, powerful trick to get you moving and talking smoothly from the moment the camera rolls:\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfac **The \u201c3-Second Launch\u201d Technique**\n\n1. **Before the camera starts**, take a deep breath and **lock in your first phrase**.\n2. **As soon as the camera rolls**, say this one line **without pause**:\n   - *\u201cLet\u2019s take a look\u2026\u201d*\n   - *\u201cFirst thing you\u2019ll notice\u2026\u201d*\n   - *\u201cThis is where it starts\u2026\u201d*\n   - *\u201cHere\u2019s the space\u2026\u201d*\n3. **Then breathe** and continue naturally.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Why it works:\n- It gives you a **safe starting point**.\n- It\u2019s a **short, strong phrase** that doesn\u2019t require thinking.\n- It **trains your brain to move from silence to speech** instantly.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd04 Practice this before the shoot:\n\n- \u201cLet\u2019s take a look\u2026\u201d  \n- \u201cFirst thing you\u2019ll notice\u2026\u201d  \n- \u201cHere\u2019s the space\u2026\u201d\n\nSay it 10 times in a row, out loud. Make it automatic.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 Bonus Tip: **Talk to the camera like you\u2019re talking to a friend**\n\n- Imagine you're showing a friend around a house you just bought.\n- You don\u2019t stumble when you're excited and engaged.\n- That\u2019s the energy you want to bring to the mic or the lens.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to help you build a short \u201claunch phrase\u201d library based on your style?"
