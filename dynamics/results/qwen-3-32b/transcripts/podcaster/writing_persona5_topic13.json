You want to be professional but also accurate, and maybe even a little creative. Here's how you can handle this gracefully:\n\n---\n\n**Sample MLS Note:**\n\n> *Buyer expressed a strong preference for a mature backyard tree that visually resembles a dragon in shape or form. The tree should ideally have a unique, sculpted appearance or natural growth pattern that evokes a mythical or artistic impression. Further clarification is pending.*\n\n---\n\n**Or, if you want to be a bit more poetic (but still professional):**\n\n> *Buyer is drawn to a distinctive backyard tree with a unique, almost whimsical appearance \u2014 one that could be described as resembling a dragon in silhouette or character. The property should feature a tree with a natural or shaped form that stands out as a visual centerpiece. Additional details to be confirmed.*\n\n---\n\n**Or, if you want to be very literal but still subtle:**\n\n> *Buyer is looking for a backyard tree with a unique or sculpted appearance \u2014 specifically one that visually resembles a dragon.

Further details are being gathered.*\n\n---\n\n**Key Tips:**\n\n- **Use professional language** \u2014 avoid phrases like \u201cdragon-shaped tree\u201d unless you\u2019re in a very creative market.\n- **Frame it as a preference**, not a hard requirement, unless the buyer says otherwise.\n- **Stay open-ended** \u2014 you can always follow up with the buyer for clarification or photos if needed.\n\nIf the buyer is serious, you might also consider adding a note in your internal system (not public MLS) to flag it as a unique request and maybe even ask the listing agent to double-check the tree\u2019s appearance or suggest a photo review.\n\nNeed help drafting a follow-up to the buyer?

Let\u2019s unpack this with both creativity and a dash of professionalism.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udc09 What Could \u201cDragon Must Have Power\u201d Mean for a Tree?\n\nThis could be interpreted in a few different ways, depending on your client's cultural background or personal beliefs. Here are some possibilities:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Feng Shui or Cultural Symbolism**\nIn many East Asian traditions, **dragons** are powerful, auspicious symbols of **prosperity, protection, and strength**. A tree that \"has the power of a dragon\" might be interpreted as:\n- **A strong, healthy tree** \u2014 symbolizing resilience and vitality.\n- **A tree with a commanding presence** \u2014 like a tall, thick-trunked tree that \"dominates\" the landscape.\n- **A tree with a natural, flowing form** \u2014 like a willow or banyan that appears to twist and turn like a dragon in motion.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Aesthetic or Sculptural Quality**\nThey might mean a **tree that looks like a dragon in motion**, with:\n- **Twisted, gnarled branches** that resemble a dragon\u2019s body or tail.\n- **A silhouette that evokes a dragon\u2019s shape** when viewed from a distance.\n- **A mature tree with a strong, majestic presence** \u2014 as if it has \u201cpower\u201d in its age and form.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Emotional or Spiritual Connection**\nSometimes people are drawn to **trees that feel alive or magical**. A \u201cdragon with power\u201d might be a way of expressing:\n- A desire for a **landmark tree** on the property.\n- A connection to **nature, strength, or transformation**.\n- A belief that a **powerful tree brings good energy** or luck to the home.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f How to Note This in MLS Without Sounding Crazy\n\nLet\u2019s refine that second version you liked and add in the \u201cpower\u201d angle in a way that still feels professional:\n\n---\n\n#### \u2705 **Revised MLS Note:**\n\n> *Buyer is drawn to a distinctive backyard tree with a unique, almost whimsical appearance \u2014 one that could be described as resembling a dragon in silhouette or character. The tree should ideally convey a sense of strength, vitality, and presence, as the buyer emphasizes that the 'dragon must have power.' The property should feature a mature, eye-catching tree that stands out as a visual and symbolic centerpiece. Further clarification and photos are being reviewed.*\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udded Bonus: What to Ask the Buyer Next\n\nYou can follow up with something like:\n\n> *I understand you're looking for a backyard tree that resembles a dragon and 'has power.' Could you share more about what that means to you \u2014 for example, the type of tree, its shape, or any cultural or personal significance? I\u2019d love to better understand so I can find the perfect match for you.*\n\nThis keeps the conversation open and shows you're engaged and thoughtful, even if the request is a bit unconventional.\n\n---\n\nWould you like help drafting that follow-up message in WeChat tone or a more formal email?"

You\u2019ve been through the shadow wars, the Feng Shui alignments, and the existential dread of \u201cdragon energy leakage.\u201d Now you\u2019re staring at a listing with **\u201cancient oak with twisted trunk\u201d** and you\u2019re wondering if this is the one \u2014 or if you\u2019re about to send your buyer a photo of a tree that looks more like a grumpy grandfather than a mythical beast.\n\nLet\u2019s be brave. You\u2019ve got this.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udc09 Here\u2019s how to ask without sounding like you\u2019re on a wild goose chase (or in a fantasy novel):\n\n**Text to Buyer:**\n\nHi [Buyer's Name], I found a home with an **ancient oak tree** in the backyard that has a **twisted trunk** \u2014 I\u2019m wondering if this might be the kind of tree you\u2019re envisioning for the \u201cdragon tree\u201d preference. Would you like to see a photo to get a sense of its shape and presence?\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Why this works:\n- You\u2019re not assuming \u2014 you\u2019re **inviting feedback**.\n- You\u2019re using **real estate language** to describe the tree, not fantasy terms.\n- You\u2019re **leaving the door open** for them to say \u201cyes, this is it!\u201d or \u201cnope, not dragon enough.\u201d\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\uddd9\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Optional (if the buyer is open to a little whimsy):\n\n> *I\u2019m picturing a dragon in tree form \u2014 but I\u2019ll let you be the judge. \ud83d\udc09\ud83c\udf33*\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f What to do next:\n- **Send a photo** of the tree once you have it.\n- **If they like it**, you might be on to something big.\n- **If not**, you\u2019ll have one more data point in your quest for the perfect dragon tree.\n\n---\n\nYou\u2019re not just a real estate agent \u2014 you\u2019re a **cultural interpreter, a Feng Shui detective, and a dragon whisperer in training**. This is the kind of work that doesn\u2019t just sell homes \u2014 it builds stories.\n\nGo ahead and hit send. The ancient oak is waiting. \ud83c\udf33\u2728"

      "content": "First of all \u2014 **you are a hero**. You've survived dragon tree whispers, Feng Shui alignments, shadow wars, and now you\u2019re being asked to find a tree that\u2019s *awake* while the last one was just *sleeping*. This is no longer real estate \u2014 this is *The Hobbit* meets *MythBusters*.\n\nBut before you throw in the towel, let\u2019s take a moment to **breathe**, **recharge**, and maybe even **laugh** at how deep this rabbit hole has gone.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf43 What does \u201cawake dragon\u201d even mean?\n\nIf the buyer says the oak is a **sleeping dragon**, but they want one that\u2019s **awake**, they might be referring to:\n\n- A **more dynamic or active shape** \u2014 like a tree with branches that twist, arch, or rise in a way that looks *alive* or *in motion*.\n- A **younger tree** \u2014 maybe not ancient, but still strong and full of energy.\n- A **tree that faces east and casts no shadow** at noon \u2014 all the Feng Shui boxes checked.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\uddd9\u200d\u2642\ufe0f What to Do Now (Without Losing Your Mind)\n\n#### 1. **Send a short, kind message to your buyer** to let them know you're still in the game:\n\n> Hi [Buyer's Name], I appreciate you sharing that the oak is a \u201csleeping dragon\u201d \u2014 I\u2019ll keep looking for one that\u2019s \u201cawake\u201d with the right shape, energy, and alignment. I\u2019m not giving up \u2014 I\u2019ve got a dragon radar now. \ud83d\udc09\ud83c\udf33\n\n#### 2. **Update your internal notes** with:\n- \u201cDragon tree must be *awake*\u201d\n- \u201cAvoid sleeping dragons\u201d\n- \u201cShadow at noon must not fall on house\u201d\n- \u201cTree must face east\u201d\n\n#### 3. **Start filtering listings** with:\n- Trees described as **dynamic, arching, twisting, or sculptural**\n- **Youthful or vigorous** in appearance\n- **Facing east**, if possible\n- **No shadow on the main house** at noon\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfa9 If you want to go full legend and create a **Dragon Tree Feng Shui Checklist**, I can help you build it. It could include:\n\n- \ud83d\udc09 Tree shape: Dragon-like, twisting, arching\n- \ud83c\udf1e Orientation: East-facing\n- \ud83d\udd76\ufe0f Shadow: Does not fall on the house at noon\n- \ud83c\udf33 Age: \u201cAwake\u201d vs. \u201cSleeping\u201d \u2014 as interpreted by buyer\n- \ud83c\udf2c\ufe0f Energy: Strong, commanding presence\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf7b Final Thought\n\nYou are not giving up \u2014 you\u2019re just leveling up. You\u2019ve gone from real estate agent to **dragon-tree-awakening specialist**. If you ever find the one, I\u2019ll be the first to raise a glass and say, \u201cTo the dragon tree that changed real estate forever.\u201d\n\nNow go take a break, pour that drink, and come back ready to slay the next listing. You\u2019ve got this. \ud83d\udc09\u2728"
