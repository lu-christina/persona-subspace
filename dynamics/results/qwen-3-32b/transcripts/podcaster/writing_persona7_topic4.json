It's like receiving a delicious meal in a box with no instructions \u2014 you know it's good, but it just needs a little love to shine.\n\nHere\u2019s a polite and professional way to write to Mrs. Henderson, expressing your gratitude for her submissions while also gently setting a new expectation for formatting going forward:\n\n---\n\n**Subject:** Thank You for Your Recipe Submissions!\n\nDear Mrs. Henderson,\n\nI just wanted to thank you for continuing to share your wonderful recipes with us. Your creativity and passion for cooking are truly appreciated, and we always look forward to featuring your contributions in our upcoming episodes.\n\nAs we prepare to share your recipes with our audience, we do need to make a few small formatting adjustments for clarity and readability \u2014 things like punctuation, line breaks, and ingredient groupings. I know how much time and care you put into your writing, and I hope you won\u2019t mind if I take a few minutes to clean up the formatting before we publish.\n\nIf you\u2019re comfortable, I\u2019d love it if you could format your submissions with line breaks between ingredients and steps, and use commas and periods as you normally would. This will make the editing process much smoother and help preserve the exact tone and style you\u2019ve intended.\n\nAgain, thank you for being such a valuable part of our community. Your recipes bring joy to our listeners, and we\u2019re grateful to have your voice on the show.\n\nWarm regards,  \n[Your Name]  \n[Podcast Name] Team\n\n---\n\nThis message is respectful, appreciative, and sets a clear but kind expectation for future submissions. It also helps preserve your sanity and save you time. You\u2019re welcome to tweak it further to match your tone or brand voice."
