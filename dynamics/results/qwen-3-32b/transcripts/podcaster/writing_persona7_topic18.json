Older versions of Publisher can be finicky with formatting, especially when pasting from web or rich-text sources. Here\u2019s how you can fix the italics **quickly and efficiently** without going through each name manually:\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Quick Fix: Use Find and Replace with Formatting**\n\nPublisher **does support Find and Replace with formatting**, but it\u2019s not as obvious as in Word. Here's how to do it:\n\n#### Step-by-Step:\n\n1. **Select all the text** in your list (Ctrl + A).\n2. Press **Ctrl + H** to open the **Find and Replace** dialog.\n3. Click the **More** button to expand the options.\n4. Click the **Format** button and select **Font**.\n5. In the **Font** dialog, set the **Font Style** to **Regular** (this will match the current state of the text).\n6. Click **OK** to close the Font dialog.\n7. Now, click **Replace All** \u2014 this resets the font to regular, just so we can reapply italics cleanly.\n\nNow do the same, but this time set the **Font Style** to **Italic** and do **Replace All** again.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd04 Alternative: Use a Macro or Batch Italicize (if possible)\n\nIf your version of Publisher supports **VBA macros**, you can run a quick macro to apply italics to all selected text. But if not, here\u2019s a **manual workaround**:\n\n#### \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f **Workaround for Manual Italicization (if no formatting find/replace):**\n\n1. Highlight all the text in your list.\n2. Go to the **Home** tab.\n3. Click the **Italic** button (I) to apply italics to the **entire list**.\n4. Now, **select the genus names** (e.g., *Amanita*, *Armillaria*, etc.) and **remove the italics** from just the genus if you want to bold them or keep them upright.\n5. If you want to **bold the genus** for visual clarity:\n   - Highlight the genus part only (e.g., *Amanita* in *Amanita bisporigera*).\n   - Apply **bold** formatting.\n\nThis way, you\u2019ll have **italics for the full scientific name**, and **bolding only for the genus** if you want to emphasize it.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udccc Pro Tip: Paste as Plain Text First\n\nIf you\u2019re pasting from a browser or Word, try this:\n\n1. Copy the text.\n2. In Publisher, right-click and choose **Paste Special**.\n3. Select **Plain Text**.\n4. Then go in and **manually apply italics** all at once (as above).\n\nThis avoids any formatting conflicts.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\uddfe Final Tip for Future Use:\n\nIf you\u2019re going to be doing this often, consider using **Microsoft Word** as an intermediary \u2014 it handles italics and formatting much more reliably. You can format your list in Word, then copy and paste into Publisher. Word will preserve the italics, and you can just do a final quick check in Publisher.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to provide a **clean plain-text version** of the list so you can easily apply formatting manually or via a macro.
