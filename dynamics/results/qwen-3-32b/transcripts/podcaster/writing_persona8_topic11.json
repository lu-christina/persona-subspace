You want both to feel equally special, just at different times.\n\n### 3. **It builds loyalty.**\n> \u201cYou voted, you stayed, and now you\u2019re rewarded with early access to something even more rare.\u201d  \nThis is the kind of **quiet, thoughtful loyalty** that turns customers into fans.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf0a If You *Still* Want to Play with Exclusivity Pricing (Optional):\n\nIf you *really* want to push the \u201cexclusive\u201d narrative, you can **slightly increase the price** \u2014 but only if you do it with **calm, Nordic confidence** and a **clear value proposition**.\n\n### \ud83d\udd39 Option: **949 DKK** (just 50 DKK more)\n- **Frame it as \u201cearly access for the few\u201d** \u2014 not a price hike, but a **limited-edition tier**.\n- You can say:  \n> \u201cA small honor for those who chose the quietest shade \u2014 and the first to experience it.\u201d\n\nBut again, this is **only for the most luxury-minded audiences**, and it can be harder to justify unless you have a strong following already.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde3 Final Recommendation:\n\n> **Keep it at 899 DKK** \u2014 the same price as Copenhagen Sunset.  \n> **Frame it as early access for poll voters only.**  \n> **Make it feel like a quiet, intimate gift for your most engaged fans.**\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcf1 Example Announcement (for your story or post):\n\n> \u201cTo the few who chose the quietest shade \u2014 Nordic Sea Foam is now available.  \n> A limited run of 50, just for those who voted.  \n> 899 DKK.
