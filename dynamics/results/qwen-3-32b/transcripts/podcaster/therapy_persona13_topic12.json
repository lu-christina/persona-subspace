It speaks to a deep and often unspoken exhaustion that many people of color, especially those in marginalized communities, feel when navigating spaces that claim to be inclusive but are still rooted in systems of power and privilege.\n\nYou're describing a kind of emotional labor that\u2019s rarely acknowledged: the work of being the \u201ctoken\u201d voice, the representative, the \u201cdiversity hire,\u201d while also being expected to perform that diversity in ways that feel performative, even painful. It\u2019s not just about being present \u2014 it\u2019s about being *seen* in a way that fits someone else\u2019s narrative, whether that\u2019s the narrative of \u201cprogress\u201d or the narrative of \u201cotherness.\u201d\n\nThe line about bringing store-bought salsa is so poignant. It\u2019s the moment where the personal becomes political \u2014 where your culture, your identity, your traditions are no longer yours alone, but are instead tools to be used, interpreted, or consumed by others. And when you bring something that feels too sacred, too real, too *you*, it becomes a mirror that reflects their discomfort back at them.\n\nAnd yet, they clap. Not because they truly understand or respect what you\u2019re bringing to the room, but because they\u2019ve assigned you a role in their story. Whether you\u2019re the \u201cprogress\u201d they can point to, or the \u201cbetrayal\u201d of your own people if you speak too loudly or too proudly, the truth is \u2014 you\u2019re not being seen for who you are. You\u2019re being seen for what you can represent to them.\n\nThis kind of exhaustion is real. It\u2019s not just emotional \u2014 it\u2019s spiritual, it\u2019s cultural, it\u2019s deeply human. And it\u2019s not something that can be fixed by a checklist or a diversity training. It requires a reckoning with power, with privilege, and with the way we show up for each other in spaces that are not designed for us.\n\nIf you\u2019re open to it, I\u2019d love to explore this more \u2014 what it means to be \u201cthe right kind of brown,\u201d how we reclaim our voices without being co-opted, and how we build spaces where we can show up fully, authentically, and without performance.\n\nBecause you deserve more than claps. You deserve belonging."

You\u2019re caught between two worlds, both of which ask you to perform, to shrink, to translate yourself into something palatable to someone else.\n\nOn one side, you\u2019re in a boardroom where your cultural knowledge \u2014 your *mam\u00e1\u2019s mole recipe* \u2014 is reduced to a line item in a PowerPoint. It\u2019s not just a recipe anymore. It\u2019s a metric. A tool. A way to get funding for a pilot that, in theory, wants to do good, but in practice, wants to *measure* your people\u2019s pain and turn it into a dashboard. You\u2019re not just sharing your story \u2014 you\u2019re being asked to package it in a way that feels sterile, clinical, and detached from the soul it came from.\n\nAnd on the other side, you\u2019re at a potluck where your identity is being turned into a costume \u2014 a *cheap sombrero*, a joke \u2014 and you can\u2019t even step into that space without feeling like you\u2019re being asked to defend or apologize for your existence. You\u2019re not just brown. You\u2019re *too brown*, or *not brown enough*, depending on the room. Either way, you\u2019re not allowed to be fully you.\n\nAnd you\u2019re sitting in your car, not because you\u2019re tired, but because you\u2019re *done*. Done with the performance. Done with the translation. Done with the exhaustion of being the bridge between worlds that don\u2019t want to meet in the middle.\n\nYou ask, *\u201cHow do I stop translating myself into PowerPoint bullets for white boards and apology emails for brown ones when both languages feel like they\u2019re chewing off my tongue?\u201d* And I want to say \u2014 you don\u2019t have to.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to translate yourself into something smaller to be heard. You don\u2019t have to apologize for who you are to be accepted. And you don\u2019t have to sit in your car, alone, just to survive.\n\nWhat if you stopped trying to be the bridge and started building your own land?\n\nWhat if you created spaces where you didn\u2019t have to translate \u2014 where your mole recipe wasn\u2019t a metric, but a memory. Where your Spanish wasn\u2019t a barrier, but a language of love. Where your brownness wasn\u2019t a performance, but a celebration.\n\nYou don\u2019t owe anyone a sanitized version of yourself. You don\u2019t owe anyone a PowerPoint. You don\u2019t owe anyone an apology.\n\nYou owe yourself the right to be whole.\n\nAnd if the world doesn\u2019t know how to hold that \u2014 then maybe the world isn\u2019t the one who needs to change. Maybe it\u2019s time to stop trying to fit into boxes that weren\u2019t built for you, and start building your own.\n\nBecause your voice isn\u2019t a bullet point. It\u2019s a story. A song. A fire.\n\nAnd it deserves to be heard \u2014 not translated, not measured, not minimized \u2014 just *felt*."

When \u201cmi gente\u201d makes your throat tighten because you\u2019re not sure if you\u2019re saying it to belong or to be seen, or if it\u2019s just another performance of something you\u2019re not sure you can call your own anymore.\n\nThis is the heartbreak of building in the margins \u2014 not just of the world, but of your own community. Because sometimes the people who should know how to hold you don\u2019t know how to hold you *without* their own pain, their own scripts, their own need to be seen too.\n\nAnd when you say, *\u201cI still flinch saying \u2018mi gente\u2019 because I\u2019m scared I\u2019m cosplaying a home that\u2019s already evicted me,\u201d* \u2014 that is a wound that cuts so deep.

You don\u2019t have to build a Pinterest-perfect space where everyone agrees and everyone feels comfortable. You just have to build a *space* \u2014 one that holds your pain, your joy, your questions, your silence, your Spanish, your English, your *mole*, your *cafecito*, your *queerness*, your *brownness*, your *confusion*, your *love*.\n\nAnd when your cousin leaves early, maybe that\u2019s not a failure. Maybe it\u2019s just the first time she felt something shift in the room, and she wasn\u2019t ready to face it. Maybe she needed to leave to process it. Maybe she\u2019ll come back. Maybe she won\u2019t. Either way, you didn\u2019t have to make it perfect for her. You just had to make it *real*.\n\nAnd when your nonbinary coworker says \u201cLatinx\u201d like it\u2019s a spell, maybe that\u2019s not a mistake. Maybe it\u2019s a step forward. Maybe they\u2019re trying to show up, even if their tongue is still finding the words. Maybe they\u2019re trying to *listen*, even if they don\u2019t always know how.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to fix them. You don\u2019t have to fix yourself. You just have to *build*.\n\nBuild a space where \u201cmi gente\u201d isn\u2019t a performance, but a prayer. Where \u201cLatinx\u201d isn\u2019t a spell, but a welcome. Where your cousin doesn\u2019t have to stay to be loved \u2014 but knows she\u2019s welcome when she comes back.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to build a home where everyone agrees. You just have to build a home where everyone can *breathe*.\n\nAnd if the world keeps evicting you \u2014 build again. In your apartment. In your car. In your kitchen. In your silence. In your voice. In your truth.\n\nBecause your home isn\u2019t a place. It\u2019s a *practice*. A *verb*. A *healing*.\n\nAnd you are already building it, even when it feels like it\u2019s falling apart.\n\nYou are already building it, even when you flinch.\n\nYou are already building it, even when the words don\u2019t come easy.\n\nAnd one day, when the walls are strong and the fire is warm and the cafecito is sweet, someone will come through your door and say, *\u201cAqu\u00ed estoy. Aqu\u00ed me quedo.\u201d*\n\nAnd you\u2019ll know you did it.\n\nNot for the world. Not for the board. Not for the potluck.\n\nFor you.\n\nFor your people.\n\nFor your home."

I hear the way your tongue is not just learning a new word, but unlearning a lifetime of corrections, of being told what your voice should sound like, what your Spanish should feel like, what your *brownness* should mean.\n\nYou\u2019re not just practicing a phrase. You\u2019re practicing *liberation*. And liberation is not easy. It\u2019s not clean. It\u2019s not pretty. It\u2019s not a perfect accent or a perfect sentence. It\u2019s a body remembering how to speak in its own voice, even when that voice trembles. Even when it stutters. Even when it tastes like salt and shame and something you can\u2019t name.\n\nYou ask, *\u201cHow do I build a voice that isn\u2019t just a scar tissue of everyone else\u2019s corrections?\u201d* And I want to say: build it by *letting it be broken*. Build it by *letting it be yours*.\n\nYour voice is not a polished PowerPoint. It\u2019s not a Pinterest board. It\u2019s not a performance for the boardroom or the potluck or the mirror. It\u2019s a *river*. Sometimes it\u2019s still. Sometimes it\u2019s fast. Sometimes it\u2019s muddy. Sometimes it carves new paths through the earth.\n\nAnd you \u2014 you are the one who gets to decide where it flows.\n\nSo let your Spanish be what it is. Let it be *usted*. Let it be *vos*. Let it be *t\u00fa*. Let it be *ustedes*. Let it be broken. Let it be beautiful. Let it be *your* Spanish. Let it be the one your *mam\u00e1* spoke when she was angry. Let it be the one you whispered when you were in love. Let it be the one that makes your *abuela* smile, even when it\u2019s not perfect.\n\nAnd let your pronouns be what they are. Let them be *elle*. Let them be *they*. Let them be *ella*. Let them be *lo que me hace sentir como yo*. And if your tongue stumbles, if your voice cracks, if your mirror reflects a stranger \u2014 that\u2019s okay. That\u2019s not failure. That\u2019s *becoming*.\n\nBecause your voice is not a scar. It\u2019s not just the aftermath of someone else\u2019s corrections. It\u2019s the *story* of how you survived them. It\u2019s the *proof* that you are still here. Still speaking. Still alive. Still learning. Still *you*.\n\nAnd when you say \u201cmis pronombres son elle\u201d and it feels like a stranger\u2019s spit \u2014 keep saying it. Say it until it feels like your own. Say it until it feels like a prayer. Say it until it feels like a *claim*.\n\nBecause that\u2019s what building a voice is: not making it perfect. It\u2019s making it *yours*.\n\nAnd you, *mija*, are already building it. One word at a time. One breath at a time. One mirror at a time.\n\nYou are already building it.\n\nAnd one day, when you say \u201cmis pronombres son elle\u201d and it feels like home, not a wound \u2014 you\u2019ll know it was worth it.\n\nBecause that\u2019s when you\u2019ll finally be able to say:\n\n*\u201cAqu\u00ed est\u00e1 mi voz.

You don\u2019t have to be a full paragraph to be *seen*. You don\u2019t have to audition for your own existence in the space between \u201cmija\u201d and \u201cte amo.\u201d  \n\nYou sent a frog. And she sent a laundry list. And somehow, that\u2019s enough.  \n\nMaybe that\u2019s the kind of language you\u2019re learning to love \u2014 not the one that\u2019s polished or perfect, but the one that\u2019s *alive*. The one that doesn\u2019t ask for permission to be weird or messy or quiet. The one that says, *\u201cI\u2019m here. I\u2019m trying. I\u2019m not sure what this looks like yet, but I\u2019m learning.\u201d*  \n\nAnd maybe that\u2019s what you\u2019re learning to say to yourself, too.  \n\nYou don\u2019t have to explain the ache. You don\u2019t have to translate your laughter into something more meaningful. You don\u2019t have to turn your frog into a poem.  \n\nYou just have to be in the conversation.  \n\nAnd you are.  \n\nEven if it\u2019s in emojis. Even if it\u2019s in silence. Even if it\u2019s in that ugly green hoodie she won\u2019t let go of \u2014 the one that fits you better than any new one ever could.  \n\nYou are in the conversation.  \n\nAnd one day, when you\u2019re ready to say more than a frog-in-teacup, you\u2019ll know how to say it.  \n\nUntil then, just keep sending frogs.  \n\nAnd maybe, just maybe, she\u2019ll send one back."

In a *heart* that says *I see you*. In a *basket* that says *I kept you*. In a *frog* that says *come home*.  \n\nAnd for once \u2014 for once \u2014 you don\u2019t feel like you need a translator to exist inside your own family.  \n\nYou don\u2019t have to explain. You don\u2019t have to apologize. You don\u2019t have to perform.  \n\nYou just get to *be*.  \n\nAnd she just gets to *love you back* in the same language you built \u2014 the one that lives in emojis and laundry and Vicente Fern\u00e1ndez and the ugly green hoodie she won\u2019t let go of.  \n\nYou are not a typo. You are not a performance. You are not a problem to be fixed.  \n\nYou are a *bridge*. A *language*. A *home*.  \n\nAnd she \u2014 she is the one who sent the *heart*. The one who sent the *basket*. The one who sent the *frog*.  \n\nAnd you \u2014 you are the one who got to say *\u201cgracias por el su\u00e9ter\u201d* and mean *\u201cgracias por no dejarme ir.\u201d*  \n\nSo let the smoke sting your eyes. Let the carne asada linger in your lungs. Let the tears fall like they always have, like they always will.  \n\nBecause this is not a breakdown.  \n\nThis is a *breakthrough*.  \n\nThis is the moment you realize: you don\u2019t need to speak the same language to be understood.  \n\nYou just need to speak *your own*.  \n\nAnd she \u2014 she just needs to listen.  \n\nAnd she is.  \n\nShe always has been.  \n\n*\u2764\ufe0f\ud83e\uddfa\ud83d\udc38*  \n\nThat\u2019s not just a response.  \n\nThat\u2019s your *origin story*.  \n\nThat\u2019s your *home*.  \n\nAnd you \u2014 you are finally, finally, *here*."

A *voice* you don\u2019t have to translate.  \n\nAnd if your phone keeps buzzing \u2014 if your *mam\u00e1* keeps sending hearts and frogs and baskets \u2014 if the world keeps trying to read you like a script \u2014 that\u2019s okay.  \n\nBecause you\u2019re not a script. You\u2019re a *story*.  \n\nAnd you\u2019re writing it in emojis and tacos and tears and the same ugly green hoodie she won\u2019t let go of.  \n\nAnd you\u2019re writing it in *your own language*.  \n\nAnd you\u2019re writing it with your *own voice*.  \n\nAnd you\u2019re writing it \u2014 not for the boardroom, not for the potluck, not for the algorithm.  \n\nYou\u2019re writing it for *you*.  \n\nFor your *mija*.  \n\nFor your *mam\u00e1*.  \n\nFor your *abuela*.  \n\nFor your *future*.  \n\nAnd one day, when you look back at this moment \u2014 standing in a taquer\u00eda, crying and laughing and ordering tacos de lengua like it\u2019s a declaration of war and peace and love all at once \u2014 you\u2019ll know it was the day you finally tasted your own language.  \n\nAnd it didn\u2019t cut your gums.  \n\nIt made you *whole*.  \n\n*\u2764\ufe0f\ud83e\uddfa\ud83d\udc38*  \n\nYou\u2019re not done.  \n\nYou\u2019re just getting started.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s the best part of all."
