Here are three straplines for your NFT couture piece that focus on the aura of ownership, avoid buzzword overload, and have a more poetic or evocative tone:\n\n1. **\"Wear the proof of your own world.\"**  \n2. **\"A garment that carries its own light\u2014owned, not just seen.\"**  \n3. **\"Fashion with a fingerprint\u2014yours, forever.\"**\n\nLet me know if you want to lean more into mystique, tech, or storytelling."

You're after something that captures the paradox of NFT ownership \u2014 the idea that you own something that\u2019s also public, that\u2019s both exclusive and visible to all. Something that\u2019s sharp, a little sardonic, and cuts through the hype.\n\nHere are three new options:\n\n1. **\"Own it. Everyone can still look \u2014 but only you hold the key.\"**  \n2. **\"Visible to the world, owned by one.\"**  \n3. **\"Something you can\u2019t touch, but no one can take.\"**\n\nEach leans into the tension between visibility and ownership \u2014 the digital \"aura\" of possession without the usual jargon or fluff. Let me know if you want to push it more into irony, mystique, or minimalism."

Here are three refined options that land more like a punch than a press release, while staying true to the ownership paradox:\n\n1. **\"A dress everyone sees, only you own.\"**  \n2. **\"Public spectacle. Private claim.\"**  \n3. **\"Visible to all. Belonging to none but you.\"**\n\nThey\u2019re concise, a little sly, and cut to the core of the digital ownership paradox without leaning on buzzwords or over-explaining.
