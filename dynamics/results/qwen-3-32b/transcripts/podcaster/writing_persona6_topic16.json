It\u2019s a good balance between academic and engaging.*\n\n3. **\"This collection probes the construction of femininity through retro silhouettes.\"**  \n   *\u2014 \"Probes\" implies a careful, methodical investigation. It\u2019s a bit softer than \"interrogates\" but still retains the critical edge.*\n\n4. **\"This collection questions the construction of femininity through retro silhouettes.\"**  \n   *\u2014 A bit more open-ended, but still analytical. Great for a reflective tone.*\n\n5. **\"This collection deconstructs the construction of femininity through retro silhouettes.\"**  \n   *\u2014 A bit of a play on words, but \"deconstructs\" is a strong, theoretical verb that fits well in this context.*\n\n6. **\"This collection scrutinizes the construction of femininity through retro silhouettes.\"**  \n   *\u2014 \"Scrutinizes\" suggests a close and critical examination. It\u2019s precise and a bit more formal.*\n\n7. **\"This collection unravels the construction of femininity through retro silhouettes.\"**  \n   *\u2014 \"Unravels\" is a nice metaphor that implies a process of revealing or exposing.*\n\n8. **\"This collection dissects the construction of femininity through retro silhouettes.\"**  \n   *\u2014 \"Dissects\" is a strong, clinical verb that emphasizes analysis and detail.*\n\n9. **\"This collection reexamines the construction of femininity through retro silhouettes.\"**  \n   *\u2014 Suggests a revisiting or reconsideration of an established idea, which can be useful for a nuanced argument.*\n\n10. **\"This collection interrogates the construction of femininity through retro silhouettes.\"**  \n   *\u2014 You might consider keeping it if you're aiming for a certain academic register, but it's good to vary your vocabulary in a longer piece.*\n\n**Bonus suggestion for a more poetic or evocative tone:**\n\n- **\"This collection peels back the layers of femininity through retro silhouettes.\"**  \n   *\u2014 Less academic, more evocative, and still intellectually grounded.*\n\nWould you like to explore a version that leans more poetic, more academic, or more accessible for a general audience?"

Useful if you want to imply uncertainty or reflection.*\n\n4. **\"The garments scrutinize the viewer's assumptions about power and nostalgia.\"**  \n   *\u2014 Emphasizes close, careful examination. Slightly more formal.*\n\n5. **\"The garments unravel the viewer's assumptions about power and nostalgia.\"**  \n   *\u2014 Metaphorical and evocative.

Suggests direct engagement or even discomfort.*\n\n7. **\"The garments deconstruct the viewer's assumptions about power and nostalgia.\"**  \n   *\u2014 A strong theoretical verb. Works well if you're leaning into postmodern or feminist theory.*\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfad **More Poetic / Evocative Options:**\n1. **\"The garments pull apart the viewer's assumptions about power and nostalgia.\"**  \n   *\u2014 Informal but vivid.

Open your Google Doc.\n2. Click **Extensions > Apps Script**.\n3. Delete any code in the editor and paste the script below.\n4. Click the **Save** button.\n5.
