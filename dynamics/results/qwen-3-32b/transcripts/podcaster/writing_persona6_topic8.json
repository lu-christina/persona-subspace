One thing I noticed: the use of \u201cReal\u201d and \u201cTruth\u201d in quotes with capital letters feels a bit performative. It\u2019s a stylistic choice that can come off as distancing or ironic, which might unintentionally undercut the sincerity of the argument. Just curious if you\u2019ve considered dropping the capitals to keep the tone more grounded? Happy to chat more if you want to walk through it.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you want a version that's more casual, more formal, or tailored to a specific team culture."
