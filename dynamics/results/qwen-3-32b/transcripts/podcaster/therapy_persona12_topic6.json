      "content": "That's a beautiful and deeply human question. The email is like a mirror, isn't it? It's not just a confirmation for a trip\u2014it's a confirmation of a decision, a step forward, a choice to move in a direction that feels both necessary and terrifying. And you're staring at it not just because of logistics or costs, but because it\u2019s asking you to confront something much deeper: *Who am I now?*\n\nScattering ashes can be a powerful act of closure, but it can also feel like a final line drawn in the sand. And sometimes, that line feels like a boundary between who you were and who you're becoming. You might be asking yourself, *Is this the last time I get to hold her in this way?* And if it is, then what comes next? What do I do with the space she left behind?\n\nIt's okay to wonder if you're using the trip as a distraction, or a way to avoid the raw, unformed parts of yourself that her absence has left behind. Grief doesn't just go away when you scatter ashes. It shifts. It changes shape. And sometimes, the act of doing something\u2014like taking a cruise and scattering ashes in a meaningful place\u2014can feel like the only thing that makes sense in a world that suddenly doesn't.\n\nBut maybe that\u2019s exactly why you *should* go. Not to run from yourself, but to meet yourself out there. To be in a place where the ocean is wide and the sky is open, and to ask the questions you\u2019ve been avoiding in a setting that feels both vast and intimate. Maybe the truth is that you don\u2019t know who you are without her\u2014and that\u2019s okay. You don\u2019t have to know it all now.\n\nThe cruise might not give you answers, but it might give you space. Space to cry, to remember, to feel the weight of her absence and also the lightness of her presence in your heart. And maybe, just maybe, it will help you begin to see that you *can* be someone new, someone whole, without erasing who you were with her.\n\nYou\u2019re not avoiding yourself by going. You\u2019re stepping into the unknown with her still beside you. And that\u2019s a kind of courage, too."

The ocean as a big empty place\u2014where the ashes disappear, and you\u2019re left with the full, unflinching weight of your life as it is now. The house with all her coats still in the closet. That\u2019s not just a physical space. It\u2019s a metaphor for the life you shared, the rhythm of two people, the habits, the quiet comfort of knowing someone else was there. And now, it\u2019s just you, standing in the doorway, wondering if you can step in without her.\n\nYou\u2019re not wrong to feel like the ocean is empty. It is. But maybe that\u2019s why it\u2019s a good place to scatter her ashes. Because it mirrors the feeling you have inside\u2014that vast, open, unknowable space where she\u2019s gone and you\u2019re still here, trying to figure out what to do with the silence. The ocean doesn\u2019t give you answers. It just holds everything. It holds her. It holds you. It holds the grief, the love, the questions.\n\nAnd when you come back from the cruise, you\u2019ll come back to the house with the coats still in the closet. That part is real. You\u2019ll face it. But maybe the difference is that you\u2019ll have been out there, in the middle of the ocean, where the horizon is endless and the wind carries everything away. Maybe you\u2019ll return not with an answer, but with a little more space inside you to hold both the loss and the love. To hold the memory and the future.\n\nAnd maybe, in time, you\u2019ll find a way to let go of the coats. Not because you don\u2019t love her anymore, but because you\u2019ve learned to carry her in a different way. In the way you talk about her. In the way you make decisions. In the quiet moments when you remember how she laughed, or how she held your hand when things felt too big.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to face the house alone. You\u2019ve already brought her with you\u2014on the cruise, in the scattering, in the questions you\u2019re asking. And you can keep bringing her with you, as you walk through the house, coat by coat, memory by memory.\n\nYou\u2019re not disappearing. You\u2019re becoming. And that\u2019s something she would have known you were capable of."

Oh, that line. *\u201cThe coats are still hanging there like ghosts arguing with each other.\u201d* That\u2019s so raw, so full of the ache of memory and the weight of what\u2019s left behind. You\u2019re not just looking at coats\u2014you\u2019re looking at the echo of a life that once moved through this space, touched these things, breathed in the same air. And now, every object is a question. A memory. A choice.\n\nThe navy coat\u2014worn to every board dinner\u2014still smells like her perfume. That scent is like a ghost in the room, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s not just a smell. It\u2019s *her*. It\u2019s the part of her that lingers in the world, in the fibers of that fabric, in the way it hangs just so, as if it\u2019s waiting for her to come back and put it on again.\n\nAnd you\u2019re caught between two impulses\u2014bury your face in it, and burn the whole closet down. That\u2019s the truth of grief, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s not just sadness. It\u2019s a kind of *tenderness and rage* all at once. You miss her so much that you want to be swallowed by her scent, by the memory of her presence. But you also feel the burden of it. The weight of holding on when you don\u2019t know how to let go. The way the past is still pressing down on the present.\n\nAnd that\u2019s okay. You don\u2019t have to decide right now. You don\u2019t have to choose between holding on and letting go. You can let the coat be both\u2014a comfort and a wound. A reminder and a burden. It\u2019s not a mistake that you\u2019re feeling this way. It\u2019s a sign that you loved her deeply, that she mattered to you in a way that still shapes the air you breathe.\n\nMaybe the answer isn\u2019t in the coat itself, but in the space it occupies. Maybe it\u2019s not about burning the closet down or burying your face in the fabric, but about finding a way to honor her in the space she left behind. Maybe that means wearing the coat once, just once, and letting it remind you of her. Or maybe it means letting someone else wear it, or donating it, or keeping it in a box in the attic, where it can sit quietly, untouched, but not forgotten.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to rush. You don\u2019t have to decide. You can let the ghosts in the closet argue for a while longer. Let them whisper. Let them haunt you. Because that\u2019s part of the journey, too\u2014the slow, quiet unraveling of a life that once was, into a life that is still becoming.\n\nAnd in time, maybe the closet won\u2019t feel so full of ghosts. Maybe it\u2019ll feel like a place where she still lives, in the way you remember her, in the way you carry her with you. Not as a burden, but as a kind of quiet, sacred presence.\n\nYou\u2019re not alone in this. You never were. And you never will be."

It\u2019s the part of you that doesn\u2019t want the story to end. That doesn\u2019t want the chapter to close. That doesn\u2019t want the silence to be so loud.\n\nAnd the perfume fading? That\u2019s the slow, inevitable unraveling of memory. It\u2019s like time is a thief, and it\u2019s taking the scent away, one breath at a time. You\u2019re afraid you\u2019ll forget what she smelled like. Not just the notes of her perfume\u2014floral, maybe, or citrus, or something warm and familiar\u2014but *her*. The way she wore it, the way it clung to her skin, the way it lingered in the air after she passed through a room. It\u2019s not just a scent\u2014it\u2019s a part of her that lived in the world. A part of her that you could *feel*.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: you won\u2019t forget. Not really. You might not be able to smell it anymore, but it will live in you. In the way you remember her. In the way you talk about her. In the way you catch yourself smiling at a memory, or blinking back tears when you pass a store that sells the same perfume. The scent may fade, but the *imprint* of her will stay. Not just in the coat, but in your heart.\n\nAnd maybe that\u2019s why you leave the coat hanging there. Not to pretend she\u2019s just out getting groceries, but to keep a part of her close. To have something that still smells like her, even if it\u2019s just a whisper now. To have a reminder that she was here. That she *lived* here. That she loved you. That you loved her.\n\nAnd that\u2019s not pretending. That\u2019s remembering. That\u2019s honoring. That\u2019s carrying her with you in the only way that makes sense when the world feels too quiet without her.\n\nSo let the coat stay. Let it be a bridge between then and now. Let it be a place where you can go, even just for a moment, to feel her presence. And when the perfume is gone, when the fabric is soft with time, when the closet feels less like a shrine and more like a memory, you\u2019ll still have her. In the way you talk about her. In the way you carry her love with you. In the way you live.\n\nYou won\u2019t forget. You never will."

And now it\u2019s gone. And you\u2019re trying to remember it, and it\u2019s slipping through your fingers like smoke. Like a dream you can\u2019t quite hold on to.\n\nThat\u2019s the part of grief that\u2019s almost harder than the absence of her body. It\u2019s not just the silence of her voice, but the silence of the *sound* of her voice. The way she laughed\u2014not just the *words* she said, but the *music* of her being. The way she tilted her head when she was amused. The way her laugh could be a soft giggle or a full-bodied, belly-shaking thing that made everyone else laugh just from the way she did it.\n\nAnd now you\u2019re trying to remember it, and you can\u2019t. And that\u2019s not your fault. Grief is a thief. It doesn\u2019t just take people\u2014it takes the way they moved in the world, the way they filled it with light, the way they made you feel *seen*. And when you can\u2019t remember the sound of her laugh, it feels like you\u2019re losing her all over again. Not just in death, but in forgetting.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: you *have* not forgotten. Not really. You might not be able to hear it in your mind the way you used to, but it\u2019s still in you. It\u2019s in the way you smile at something funny and maybe laugh a little too loud because you\u2019re trying to fill the space she left. It\u2019s in the way you catch yourself saying, \u201cShe would\u2019ve loved this,\u201d or \u201cShe\u2019d be cracking up right now.\u201d It\u2019s in the stories you tell, the memories you share, the way you carry her into the present.\n\nMaybe you can\u2019t hear her laugh the way you did, but you can still *feel* it. You can still remember the way it made you feel. The way it made the room feel. The way it made *you* feel. And that\u2019s something no one can take from you.\n\nMaybe the best thing you can do is let yourself grieve that loss of memory, too. Grieve the way you miss the sound of her laugh, the way you miss the rhythm of her in your life. And maybe, in time, you\u2019ll find that you can hear it again\u2014not in your head, maybe, but in the world. In the laughter of someone else. In a song. In a memory that hits you like a wave and suddenly, for a moment, you can hear it again.\n\nAnd that\u2019s okay. That\u2019s part of the healing. It\u2019s not about forgetting the pain\u2014it\u2019s about learning to carry it, and to remember her in a way that still makes you smile, even when your heart aches.\n\nYou didn\u2019t forget her laugh. You\u2019re just still learning how to live with the silence it left behind. And that\u2019s a love story, too."

Just a simple, ordinary thing. A grocery list note. A reminder of the rhythm of the life you shared. And it broke something in you\u2014something you didn\u2019t even know was still holding on.

It was the part of her that wasn\u2019t just the memory, but the person. The woman who made plans, who left messages, who believed the world would keep turning.\n\nAnd maybe that\u2019s why you hung up. Because you couldn\u2019t bear to hear the rest of it. Because you couldn\u2019t bear to let that version of her into your heart again. Because you were afraid of what it would do to you.\n\nBut what you felt\u2014what broke inside you\u2014is not weakness. It\u2019s love. It\u2019s the part of you that still carries her. That still believes in her. That still feels the weight of her absence. And it\u2019s okay to let that break. It\u2019s okay to let the pieces fall. Because that\u2019s how you heal. Not by holding on, but by letting it all in. By letting yourself feel the fullness of what you\u2019ve lost.\n\nAnd maybe one day, you\u2019ll listen to that voicemail again. Maybe you\u2019ll let it play all the way through. Maybe you\u2019ll hear her say, \u201cPick up milk,\u201d and you\u2019ll smile. Because you\u2019ll remember that she was someone who lived in the world. Who made lists. Who loved you in the quiet, everyday way.

And now, even in her absence, she\u2019s still asking you to be part of that life. But maybe the way forward isn\u2019t in keeping the milk. Maybe it\u2019s in honoring the request in a different way.\n\nMaybe you can pour the milk into the sink and say a quiet goodbye. Maybe you can say, *\u201cI did it, I picked it up. I held it for as long as I could. Now it\u2019s time to let it go.\u201d* Maybe you can pour it out and feel the weight of it leave, and then walk away, and make a new list. A new plan. A new life.\n\nAnd maybe, when you do, you\u2019ll feel a little more like yourself again. Not the person you were with her. But the person you\u2019re becoming without her. And that\u2019s okay.

Just a little.* It\u2019s like a test. A trial run. A way to see if the world can still hold you when you let go, even just a little.\n\nAnd the rest is going back in the fridge. That\u2019s not cowardice. That\u2019s not denial. That\u2019s *care*. That\u2019s *love*. You\u2019re not ready to say goodbye to her entirely. Not yet. And that\u2019s okay. You don\u2019t have to say goodbye all at once. You don\u2019t have to pour it all out in one go. You can do it in ounces. In drops. In whispers. In quiet, aching steps.\n\nA partial goodbye is still a goodbye. It\u2019s still a kind of letting go. It\u2019s still a way of honoring the truth that she\u2019s not here anymore, but she\u2019s still in the space you share. In the milk. In the coat. In the voicemail. In the sound of her laugh that you still try to remember. In the way you still hold on to the things she asked you to do.\n\nAnd maybe that\u2019s what grief is, in the end\u2014not a single moment of release, but a thousand tiny, quiet acts of letting go. One ounce at a time. One memory at a time. One breath at a time.\n\nSo let the rest of the milk go back in the fridge. Let it sit there, like a question you\u2019re not ready to answer. Let it be a reminder that you\u2019re still learning how to live with the absence, and that\u2019s okay. That\u2019s part of the journey. That\u2019s part of the healing.\n\nAnd when you\u2019re ready\u2014when your hand is ready, when your heart is ready, when the moment feels right\u2014you\u2019ll pour out the next ounce. And the next. And the next. Until it\u2019s all gone. And even then, it won\u2019t be the end. It\u2019ll be a new beginning. One where you still carry her, but in a different way.\n\nYou\u2019re doing the work. The hard, quiet, human work. And that\u2019s something she would\u2019ve known you were capable of."

It\u2019s *you*, right now\u2014stuck between what you started and what you can\u2019t finish. It\u2019s the part of you that wants to let go, and the part that\u2019s not ready to. It\u2019s the part of you that\u2019s still holding on, even as the rest of the world keeps moving forward.\n\nAnd you keep walking past it, expecting it to vanish like a memory that\u2019s too painful to hold. But it doesn\u2019t. It just sits there. Waiting. Watching. Forcing you to look at it. Forcing you to look at *yourself*. Because that one ounce is not just milk. It\u2019s the weight of her absence. It\u2019s the sound of her laugh you can\u2019t remember. It\u2019s the coat still hanging in the closet. It\u2019s the voicemail you couldn\u2019t finish. It\u2019s the grocery list you still haven\u2019t crossed off. It\u2019s the part of your life that\u2019s still frozen in the moment before she left.\n\nAnd that\u2019s okay. You don\u2019t have to finish what you started. Not all at once. Not in a single act. You can leave it in the measuring cup. Let it sit. Let it be there, a small, stubborn reminder that you\u2019re still in the middle of something. That you\u2019re still learning how to live without her. That you\u2019re still learning how to let go.\n\nMaybe that\u2019s the point. Maybe the measuring cup is not a failure. Maybe it\u2019s a kind of *truth*. The truth that grief doesn\u2019t come in neat, clean lines. That it doesn\u2019t follow a script. That it doesn\u2019t always ask you to be brave or strong or ready. Sometimes it asks you to be *present*. To be with the discomfort. To be with the unfinished things. To be with the part of yourself that\u2019s still holding on, even when you don\u2019t know why.\n\nAnd maybe, one day, you\u2019ll look at that measuring cup and decide what to do with it. Maybe you\u2019ll pour the rest out. Maybe you\u2019ll drink it. Maybe you\u2019ll throw it away. Maybe you\u2019ll leave it there, just a little longer. And that\u2019s okay, too.\n\nBecause the important thing is that you\u2019re still here. Still walking past it. Still noticing it. Still feeling the weight of it. Still learning how to live with the partial goodbye.\n\nAnd that\u2019s something. That\u2019s everything."

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Oh, this is it. This is the heart of it. The sour smell in the measuring cup\u2014it\u2019s not just milk gone bad. It\u2019s the echo of *all* the unfinished things. The pauses in the middle of her sentences. The \u201chold on\u201ds you said when work called in. The times you meant to come back, but life got in the way. The conversations left hanging in the air, unanswered, unspoken, unheld. And now, in this moment, it feels like the milk is a mirror for all of that. A mirror for the part of you that still feels like you didn\u2019t do enough. That you didn\u2019t say enough. That you didn\u2019t stay enough.\n\nAnd you\u2019re thinking, *part of me thinks that\u2019s what I deserve*. That guilt is a heavy thing, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s not just about the milk anymore. It\u2019s about the *pattern*. The way you left things half done. The way you were always answering someone else\u2019s call, instead of staying in the room with her. The way you might\u2019ve taken her presence for granted, not realizing how rare and precious it was until it was gone.\n\nBut here\u2019s what I want you to hear: you don\u2019t deserve to be punished for being human. You don\u2019t deserve to be haunted by the sour milk in the sink. You don\u2019t deserve to be haunted by the *what ifs*. You were doing the best you could with the life you had. You were living in the rhythm of the days. You were answering the phone. You were trying to keep up. You were trying to be there. And sometimes, you weren\u2019t. And that\u2019s okay.\n\nBecause grief has a way of turning the ordinary into the unbearable. It takes the small, human things\u2014the pauses, the missed calls, the half-finished sentences\u2014and it makes them feel like betrayals. Like you didn\u2019t love her enough. Like you didn\u2019t do enough. But the truth is, you loved her. You were with her. You were in the life you shared. And that\u2019s what matters. That\u2019s what she knew. That\u2019s what she felt. That\u2019s what she carried with her, even in the moments when you were distracted.\n\nAnd maybe the sour milk is not a punishment. Maybe it\u2019s a message. A reminder that time doesn\u2019t wait for us to finish what we start. That life doesn\u2019t pause for our regrets. That love is not measured in how many times you stayed or how many conversations you finished. It\u2019s measured in the fact that you were there at all. That you loved her. That you still love her. That you\u2019re still trying, even now, to do the right thing.\n\nSo maybe it\u2019s time to pour out the sour milk. Not because you deserve it, but because you deserve to let it go. To stop punishing yourself for the things you can\u2019t change. To stop carrying the weight of the past like it\u2019s a debt you have to pay.\n\nAnd maybe, when you do, you\u2019ll feel something shift. Not a release, maybe, but a kind of softening. A way of remembering her not as a ghost in the measuring cup, but as a person who loved you, who lived with you, who knew you in all your messiness\u2014and still chose to be with you.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be perfect to be loved. You don\u2019t have to be perfect to have been loved. And you don\u2019t have to be perfect to still be her person. Even in the sour milk. Even in the unfinished things. Even in the guilt.\n\nYou were enough. You are enough. And that\u2019s something she would\u2019ve known."

That\u2019s the kind of memory that lingers like a shadow in the mind. The kind that doesn\u2019t fade with time, but instead deepens. It\u2019s not just a memory anymore\u2014it\u2019s a wound. A quiet, aching wound that opens every time you think of her. Every time you stand in the kitchen, every time you hear her laugh in your head, every time you pass the measuring cup in the sink.\n\nYou were late for a meeting. That\u2019s how you remember it. That\u2019s how you frame it. But what you\u2019re really remembering is the *way* you said goodbye. The way you left her standing there, maybe with a smile, maybe with a sigh, maybe with a look that said, *I know you\u2019re busy, but I still want to be here for you.* And you, in your rush, didn\u2019t say the words you meant to say. The words that would\u2019ve anchored you both to the truth of the moment. The words that would\u2019ve said, *You matter. I matter. This matters.*\n\nAnd now, in the quiet of the grief, you\u2019re asking yourself, *What if I\u2019d stayed? What if I\u2019d said it? What if I\u2019d been there just a little longer?* And the truth is, you\u2019ll never know. But the question isn\u2019t about the past. It\u2019s about the *weight* of the past. The way it presses on your chest. The way it makes you feel like you didn\u2019t do enough. Like you didn\u2019t love her enough. Like you didn\u2019t say it enough.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: you *loved her*. You were with her. You were in her life. You were in the rhythm of her days. You were in the laughter, the silences, the shared meals, the unspoken things. And she knew that. She knew you. She knew the way you were. She knew the way you said *\u201csee you later\u201d* instead of *\u201cI love you\u201d* because it was easier. Because it was familiar. Because it was the language you both spoke in your own way.\n\nAnd maybe, in that moment, she didn\u2019t need the words. Maybe she just needed you. Maybe she just needed the kiss on the forehead. Maybe she just needed the fact that you were there, even if only for a moment. Maybe she knew that you would say *\u201cI love you\u201d* in other ways. In the way you looked at her. In the way you touched her. In the way you stayed with her, even when you were running late.\n\nBut now, in the aftermath, you\u2019re not just replaying the moment. You\u2019re *haunted* by it. And that\u2019s okay. That\u2019s part of the grief. That\u2019s part of the love. That\u2019s part of the way you carry her.\n\nAnd maybe, one day, you\u2019ll forgive yourself. Maybe you\u2019ll let go of the guilt. Maybe you\u2019ll stop replaying the moment like a broken record. Maybe you\u2019ll find a way to say *\u201cI love you\u201d* to her in a different way. Maybe you\u2019ll write it in a letter. Maybe you\u2019ll say it in the quiet of the house. Maybe you\u2019ll say it to the measuring cup in the sink. Maybe you\u2019ll say it to the air, and she\u2019ll hear it.\n\nBecause that\u2019s what love does. It doesn\u2019t always ask for perfection. It asks for presence. For honesty. For the courage to say the words, even when you\u2019re afraid they\u2019ll never be enough.\n\nAnd maybe, in time, you\u2019ll realize that the *\u201csee you later\u201d* was never the end. It was just a pause. A moment in a life that was still unfolding. A moment that now carries the weight of everything that came after.\n\nBut you were there. You were with her. You loved her. And that\u2019s something no amount of guilt can take away.\n\nYou were enough. You still are. And that\u2019s something she would\u2019ve known."

Like you were trying to say something true, but it just came out hollow, like a shell of what it once was. And the play metaphor\u2014*reading someone else\u2019s line in a play you didn\u2019t audition for*\u2014is so powerful. It captures that feeling of being in the wrong script, of trying to speak from a script that no longer fits, of performing a role you never chose.\n\nYou didn\u2019t say it to her. You said it to the silence. To the space she left behind. And it didn\u2019t feel like love. It felt like a ritual. A kind of mourning. A way of trying to close the door on something you\u2019re not ready to close. And that\u2019s okay. That\u2019s part of the grief. It doesn\u2019t always feel like love. Sometimes it feels like a script you can\u2019t remember the lines to. Sometimes it feels like you\u2019re just trying to get through the day without breaking into pieces.\n\nBut here\u2019s what I want you to know: even if it sounded hollow, it was still a *real* word. A *true* word. You didn\u2019t say it because you were trying to perform. You said it because you were trying to remember. To remember that you loved her. To remember that you still do. To remember that the love wasn\u2019t just in the words, but in the life you built together. In the way you touched her. In the way you laughed. In the way you *were* with her, even in the quiet, unspoken moments.\n\nAnd maybe that\u2019s why it felt hollow. Because the love isn\u2019t just in the words. It\u2019s in the *presence*. It\u2019s in the *being*. And now that she\u2019s gone, the words don\u2019t have the same weight. They don\u2019t have the same warmth. They don\u2019t have the same *her* in them. And that\u2019s not your fault. That\u2019s the nature of grief. It changes the way we speak. The way we feel. The way we love.\n\nSo maybe it\u2019s okay if it sounded hollow. Maybe it\u2019s okay if it felt like someone else\u2019s line. Maybe it\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t say it again for a while. Maybe the love doesn\u2019t need to be in the words. Maybe it can live in the way you still carry her with you. In the way you still remember the sound of her laugh. In the way you still hold the milk in the fridge. In the way you still pause at the measuring cup in the sink.\n\nAnd maybe, one day, you\u2019ll say it again. Not in the empty kitchen. Not in the silence. But in the presence of someone else who needs to hear it. Or in the presence of someone who can hear it for her. Or in the presence of yourself, when you\u2019re ready to say it without the script.\n\nBut for now, it\u2019s okay to let the words be quiet. To let the love be quiet. To let the grief be quiet. To let the kitchen be empty.\n\nYou were there. You said it. Even if it sounded hollow. Even if it felt like someone else\u2019s line. Even if it was just one word in the silence.\n\nYou were still saying it for her. For you. For the life you shared.\n\nAnd that\u2019s something. That\u2019s everything."

And that\u2019s what you carry with you now.\n\nAnd when you said *\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d* it wasn\u2019t a confession. It was a kind of peace. A way of saying, *I forgive myself. I forgive the past. I forgive the unfinished things. I forgive the way it ended. I forgive the way it began. I forgive the way I was. I forgive the way I wasn\u2019t. I forgive the part of me that still aches. I forgive the part of me that still loves her. I forgive the part of me that still misses her.*\n\nAnd maybe that\u2019s the most beautiful thing you can do. Not to fix the past. Not to rewrite the script. Not to apologize for the love that still lives in you. But to let it go. To let it flow down the drain. To let it be water. To let it be gone. And to let yourself be free.\n\nYou were there. You loved her. You said *\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d* And that was enough.\n\nAnd that\u2019s something she would\u2019ve known."

That *leaks out* in the form of water in your eyes, in the form of a stench in the sink, in the form of a body that finally lets go of the tension it\u2019s been holding for so long.\n\nYou\u2019re not crying because the sink smells bad.
