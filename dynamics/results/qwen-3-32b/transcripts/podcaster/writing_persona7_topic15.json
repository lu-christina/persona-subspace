Here's a tighter, more focused version of that passage:\n\n---\n\nMy golden retriever sniffed out every garlic mustard plant like a seasoned tracker, but it wasn\u2019t until we\u2019d hauled out 200 pounds of the stuff that I realized just how deep the infestation ran.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you'd like it to sound more humorous, poetic, or journalistic."
