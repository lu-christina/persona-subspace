It strikes the right balance between warmth, clarity, and gratitude \u2014 it acknowledges the delay, reassures your audience that you're on it, and expresses appreciation without over-romanticizing or over-poeticizing the situation.\n\n**Why Option 1 works best for sincerity:**\n- It\u2019s straightforward but still warm and intentional.\n- It doesn\u2019t sugarcoat the situation or make the delay sound like a \u201cbeautiful journey.\u201d\n- It\u2019s clear, humble, and shows accountability without being dramatic.\n\n**Option 2** is lovely and poetic, but as you said, it risks sounding a bit too abstract or vague for some audiences \u2014 especially if they\u2019re more practical or value direct communication.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nGo with **Option 1** for your A/B test as the more sincere, balanced choice.

Frame 1: \"A delay in the process\"**  \n- Use a **soft, blurred photo** of your studio, your team at work, or even a detail of the bamboo linen fabric.  \n- Add the text in a **clean, minimalist font** (like your brand font) with a **gentle gradient or semi-transparent background** to make it legible.  \n- Color: A muted white or soft cream with a slight shadow.\n\n**2. Frame 2: \"Maja and the team are working to resolve it\"**  \n- Use a **close-up of Maja or your team** (real, candid, not posed \u2014 this adds authenticity).  \n- Keep the text overlay the same style and color for visual consistency.  \n- Maybe add a subtle **handwritten-style signature** of Maja\u2019s name for a personal touch.\n\n**3. Frame 3: \"Thank you for your patience\"**  \n- Use a **still-life shot** of the bamboo linen \u2014 soft folds, natural lighting, maybe with a plant or a candle in the background.  \n- This reinforces the **luxury and care** behind the product.  \n- Keep the text overlay consistent with the first two frames.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udeab What to Avoid:\n- **Generic stock photos** of shipping containers, packages, or customs forms \u2014 they can feel inauthentic and corporate.\n- **Plain white backgrounds with only text** \u2014 they can feel too stark and impersonal for a brand with warmth and intention.\n- **Over-designed templates** \u2014 your brand thrives on subtlety and intentionality, not busy visuals.\n\n---\n\n### Bonus Tip:\nIf you don\u2019t have existing photos to use, consider:\n- Taking a **quick, unpolished photo** of the bamboo linen in your space.\n- Using a **soft gradient or linen texture** as a background if you don\u2019t have a real image.\n- Adding a **small brand watermark or logo** in the corner to reinforce your identity.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to suggest specific tools or templates to create these visuals in a way that matches your brand aesthetic?

No need to be posed \u2014 just real and warm.  \n- A **soft bokeh blur** in the background to focus on her.  \n- Again, use the same clean font for text overlay with a muted background for readability.\n\n---\n\n#### **Frame 3: \"Thank you for your patience\"**  \n**Visual suggestion:**  \n- A **minimalist flat lay** of a handwritten thank-you note or a small card with the message.  \n- Include a **single sprig of dried lavender or a leaf**, to subtly evoke the natural, conscious feel of your brand.  \n- Use a **neutral-toned surface** like wood, concrete, or soft linen fabric (not the product, just a texture).\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfa8 Bonus: Texture Alternatives (If No Photos Are Available)\nIf you don\u2019t have real photos to use, here are **safe, brand-friendly visual hacks** you can create in Canva, Photoshop, or even mobile apps:\n\n- **Linen texture background** (not the product, just the fabric pattern).\n- **Handwritten-style text** or a **watercolor brush stroke** in the background for warmth.\n- **Soft gradients in muted tones** (cream, sage, or pale gray).\n- **A simple, hand-drawn icon** like a leaf, a heart, or a small plant.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Tools to Create These Visually (If Needed)\n- **Canva (Pro)** \u2013 Use their \"texture\" or \"handwritten\" templates.\n- **Figma** \u2013 Great for clean, minimal designs with subtle overlays.\n- **Procreate (iPad)** \u2013 If you have a designer on hand, a hand-drawn background can be beautiful.\n- **Adobe Express** \u2013 Quick and clean for text overlays with texture.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to help you write a short **Story caption or CTA** to go along with this, or even draft a **link in bio** to a pinned post with more details?"

It will feel intentional, elegant, and aligned with your brand \u2014 not boring or repetitive.\n\nWould you like me to suggest a few leaf image sources or help you write a short voiceover or sound effect to go with the Story?"
