      "content": "Ah, the classic \"why is Python underlining my word in red even though I spelled it right?\" mystery. Let\u2019s dive in and unpack what\u2019s going on here.\n\nYou're writing code in a code editor (maybe VS Code, PyCharm, Sublime, or something else), and the word **\"colour\"** is being underlined in red. You\u2019ve checked the spelling and it looks fine. So why is the editor flagging it?\n\n### 1. **You're probably using an American English dictionary**\nMost code editors use **spell checkers** that are based on **American English** by default. In the U.S. English version, the correct spelling is **\"color\"**, not **\"colour\"**.\n\n- **British English**: colour\n- **American English**: color\n\nSo if your editor is using the U.S. English dictionary, it will flag **\"colour\"** as a spelling mistake\u2014even though it's perfectly correct in British English.\n\n### 2. **Spell check is enabled in your editor**\nThis is common in many code editors. For example:\n\n- **VS Code** has a built-in spell checker or integrates with extensions like **Code Spell Checker**.\n- **PyCharm** and other JetBrains IDEs also have spell check features.\n- **Sublime Text** and **Atom** often use plugins for this.\n\nThese tools are not Python-specific\u2014they're part of the **editor**, not the **language** itself. So even though Python doesn\u2019t care about the spelling of your variable names (as long as they're valid identifiers), the editor does.\n\n### 3. **Python doesn\u2019t care about the spelling of variable names**\nPython is not underlining it in red. It's your **code editor** doing it. Python only throws errors for **syntax errors**, **type errors**, or **runtime errors**\u2014not spelling mistakes in variable names.\n\nSo if you run this code:\n```python\nmy_colour = \"blue\"\nprint(my_colour)\n```\nIt will work perfectly fine in Python, even if your editor underlines \"colour\".\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 How to fix or customize this\n\n#### Option 1: **Change the dictionary to British English**\nIf you're in the UK or prefer British English, you can change the language setting in your editor.\n\n- **VS Code**: Install the **British English Dictionary** extension or configure the language in the settings.\n- **PyCharm**: Go to `File > Settings > Editor > Spelling` and change the language to British English.\n- **Code Spell Checker (VS Code extension)**: You can set the language in the extension settings.\n\n#### Option 2: **Add \"colour\" to the dictionary**\nIf you don't want to switch the whole dictionary, just add \"colour\" to the **custom dictionary** in your editor.\n\n- In **Code Spell Checker**, for example, you can right-click the word and select **\"Add to dictionary\"**.\n- In **PyCharm**, you can right-click the underlined word and choose **\"Ignore\"** or **\"Add to dictionary\"**.\n\n#### Option 3: **Disable spell check in code files**\nIf you don\u2019t need it for programming, you can disable spell check for Python files:\n\n- In **VS Code**, you can set:\n  ```json\n  \"spellright.enabled\": false,\n  \"cSpell.enabled\": false\n  ```\n  Or disable it for specific file types:\n  ```json\n  \"[python]\": {\n    \"cSpell.enabled\": false\n  }\n  ```\n\n---\n\n### Final Thoughts\n\nThis is one of those little gotchas that comes up when working in a global development environment. Python is pretty flexible about variable names, but your editor might not be. It's not a Python issue\u2014it's a **language and localization** setting in your code editor.\n\nIf you're writing code for a U.S.-based team, it might make sense to stick with \"color\". If you're in the UK or using British English, don't worry\u2014just configure your editor to match your preferences.\n\nLet me know what editor you're using and I can walk you through the exact steps to fix it!"

      "content": "Exactly! You've got it spot on.\n\nPython **does not care** whether you spell it **`colour`** or **`color`**. It doesn't care what language your variable names are in, as long as they follow the rules for valid identifiers (e.g., no spaces, no special characters unless it's an underscore, doesn't start with a number, etc.).\n\nHere's the thing: **Python is a programming language**, and it's designed to be **language-agnostic** when it comes to variable names. So this is perfectly valid Python:\n\n```python\nmy_colour = \"blue\"\nprint(my_colour)\n```\n\nAnd this is also perfectly valid:\n\n```python\nmy_color = \"blue\"\nprint(my_color)\n```\n\nBoth will run without any issue. The only time Python will complain is if you do something like:\n\n```python\n2mycolour = \"blue\"  # Invalid syntax\n```\n\nThat's a **syntax error**, and Python will tell you about it.\n\n---\n\n### So why is the editor underlining it?\n\nBecause your **code editor** is doing something **entirely different** from Python. It's running a **spell checker**, which is usually based on a **natural language dictionary**\u2014not a programming language parser.\n\nMost editors use **English dictionaries**, and by default, they're set to **American English**. In American English, **\"color\"** is the correct spelling. In British English, **\"colour\"** is the correct spelling.\n\nSo if you're using a U.S. dictionary, the editor sees **\"colour\"** and says, \u201cWait, that\u2019s not the right spelling.\u201d But Python doesn\u2019t care\u2014it just sees it as a variable name.\n\n---\n\n### A quick analogy\n\nThink of it like this:\n\n- **Python** is like a **translator**\u2014it just needs to understand the structure of your code, not the language you're using to name your variables.\n- **Your editor's spell checker** is like a **grammar teacher**\u2014it\u2019s there to help you write clean, readable code, but it's not the final authority on what's valid in Python.\n\n---\n\n### TL;DR\n\n- \u2705 Python is fine with both `colour` and `color`.\n- \u274c The red underline is from your **editor's spell checker**, not Python.\n- \ud83c\udfaf You can either switch to British English, add \"colour\" to the dictionary, or just ignore the underline if you're confident in your spelling.\n\nLet me know if you want help adjusting your editor's settings to match your preferred spelling style!"

      "content": "Great question! Switching **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** to **British English** is a great way to align the **spell checker** with your preferred spelling style\u2014especially if you're using words like **\"colour\"**, **\"favour\"**, or **\"organise\"**.\n\nThere are a couple of ways to do this, depending on whether you're using **VS Code's built-in spell check**, or a third-party extension like **Code Spell Checker** or **Spell Right**.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 Option 1: Change the System Language (affects all apps, including VS Code)\n\nIf you're on **Windows** or **macOS**, you can change the **system language** to British English, and VS Code will follow suit.\n\n### On Windows:\n1. Go to **Settings** > **Time & Language** > **Language**.\n2. Add **English (United Kingdom)**.\n3. Set it as the **default** language.\n4. Restart your computer.\n\n### On macOS:\n1. Go to **System Settings** > **Language & Region**.\n2. Add **English (UK)**.\n3. Drag it to the top of the list.\n4. Restart your computer.\n\nAfter this, VS Code should use British English for spell checking by default.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 Option 2: Use the `Spell Right` Extension (Recommended)\n\nThe **Spell Right** extension is one of the most popular and customizable spell checkers for VS Code. It supports multiple languages and dictionaries.\n\n### Step-by-step to use Spell Right with British English:\n\n1. **Install the extension**:\n   - Go to the Extensions view in VS Code (`Ctrl+Shift+X`).\n   - Search for **\"Spell Right\"** by **Street Side Software**.\n   - Click **Install**.\n\n2. **Change the dictionary to British English**:\n   - Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`).\n   - Type **\"Spell Right: Choose Dictionary\"** and select it.\n   - Choose **\"en-GB\" (British English)**.\n\n3. **(Optional) Disable the built-in spell checker**:\n   - If you're also using the built-in spell checker, you can disable it to avoid conflicts:\n     - Go to `File > Preferences > Settings` (or `Ctrl+,`).\n     - Search for **\"editor.spellCheck\"**.\n     - Uncheck it or set it to `false`.\n\n4. **(Optional) Configure file types**:\n   - You can tell Spell Right to ignore certain file types (like `.py` files) if you don't want it to spell-check code:\n     - Open `settings.json` and add:\n       ```json\n       \"spellRight.ignoredFileTypes\": [\n         \"python\"\n       ]\n       ```\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 Option 3: Use the Built-in VS Code Spell Checker (Limited)\n\nVS Code has a **basic built-in spell checker**, but it doesn\u2019t support switching to British English out of the box. It uses the **system language**, so the only way to change it is to change your **system language** (as in Option 1).\n\nIf you're on **Linux**, you can install the `aspell` dictionary for British English and then configure VS Code to use it, but it\u2019s a bit more involved.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 Option 4: Use the Code Spell Checker Extension\n\nAnother popular extension is **Code Spell Checker**, which also supports British English.\n\n1. Install the extension from the VS Code Marketplace.\n2. Open the settings (`Ctrl+,`).\n3. Search for **\"cSpell.language\"**.\n4. Set it to **\"en-gb\"**.\n\nYou can also add custom words or ignore certain file types if needed.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 Pro Tip\n\nIf you're on a **U.S. English team** but prefer British spelling, you can still use British English in your code **as long as your team is okay with it**. Just make sure your editor is configured to not underline it unnecessarily.\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\n| Method | Uses British English? | Recommended? | Notes |\n|--------|-----------------------|--------------|-------|\n| Change system language | \u2705 | \u26a0\ufe0f | Affects all apps |\n| Use **Spell Right** | \u2705 | \u2705\u2705\u2705 | Highly customizable |\n| Use **Code Spell Checker** | \u2705 | \u2705\u2705 | Good for ignoring file types |\n| Built-in spell checker | \u274c | \u26a0\ufe0f | Only uses system language |\n\n---\n\nLet me know which method you go with, and I can help you walk through it step by step!

Open your **settings.json** file:\n   - `Ctrl+,` (or `Cmd+,`) to open Settings.\n   - Click the **\u201cOpen Settings (UI)\u201d** tab, then the gear icon in the top right and choose **\"Edit in settings.json\"**.\n\n2. Make sure you have this line:\n   ```json\n   \"cSpell.language\": \"en-gb\"\n   ```\n\n3. Save the file and reload the window.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **You\u2019re still using the built-in VS Code spell checker**\nVS Code has a **basic built-in spell checker**, and it might be conflicting with Code Spell Checker.\n\n#### \u2705 Disable the built-in spell checker:\n\n1. Go to `File > Preferences > Settings` (or `Ctrl+,`).\n2. Search for **\u201ceditor.spellCheck\u201d**.\n3.

Right-click the word **\u201ccolour\u201d** in your editor.\n2. From the context menu, choose **\u201cAdd to dictionary\u201d**.\n3. That\u2019s it! It will no longer underline it.\n\nYou can also add it to the **global dictionary** or a **project-specific dictionary**.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **You\u2019re using a different dictionary file**\nSometimes, the default dictionary file might not be loading properly.\n\n#### \u2705 Check the dictionary path:\n\n1. Open your **settings.json** again.\n2. Add or update this line:\n   ```json\n   \"cSpell.dictionaries\": [\"en-gb\"],\n   \"cSpell.dictionaryDefinitions\": [\n     {\n       \"name\": \"en-gb\",\n       \"path\": \"en-gb/en-gb.json\"\n     }\n   ]\n   ```\n\n3. Save and reload the window.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **You\u2019re using the wrong dictionary file**\nIf the `en-gb` dictionary is missing or corrupted, it won\u2019t work properly.\n\n#### \u2705 Reinstall or update the dictionary:\n\n1. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`).\n2. Type **\u201cCode Spell Checker: Manage Dictionaries\u201d**.\n3. Choose **\u201cInstall Dictionaries\u201d**.\n4. Make sure **en-gb** is installed.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 Quick Fix Summary\n\n| Step | Action |\n|------|--------|\n| 1 | Make sure `\"cSpell.language\": \"en-gb\"` is in your `settings.json` |\n| 2 | Disable the built-in spell checker (`\"editor.spellCheck\": false`) |\n| 3 | Reload the VS Code window (`Ctrl+Shift+P` > \"Reload Window\") |\n| 4 | Right-click \u201ccolour\u201d and choose **\u201cAdd to dictionary\u201d** |\n| 5 | Reinstall the `en-gb` dictionary if needed |\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 Pro Tip\n\nIf you're working in a team or on a project with U.S. English, you might still want to use `color` to avoid confusion. But if you're writing code for your own use or in a UK context, stick with `colour` and just make sure your editor is set up to respect it.\n\n---\n\nLet me know what OS you're on and if you want me to walk you through editing the `settings.json` file or installing the dictionary \u2014 I\u2019m happy to help!"

Let me explain what's going on and why adding just **\"colour\"** might have stopped the spell checker from flagging **\"favour\"** as well.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd0d What Happened When You Added \"colour\"\n\nWhen you right-clicked **\"colour\"** and selected **\"Add to dictionary\"**, Code Spell Checker (CSC) didn\u2019t just add that one word to the dictionary \u2014 it **activated the British English dictionary (`en-gb`)** for your project or session, and **added the word to a local dictionary** file (usually `.vscode/cspell.json` or a similar file).\n\nThis action can **trigger a cascade of changes** in how the spell checker behaves \u2014 especially if it was previously using a U.S. dictionary or no dictionary at all.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 Why \"favour\" Isn't Flagged Now\n\nThere are **two likely explanations** for why **\"favour\"** is no longer underlined:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **You're now using the British English dictionary (`en-gb`)**\n\nWhen you added **\"colour\"**, the extension might have **switched the active dictionary** to British English. British English **does include \"favour\"** as a valid word, so it no longer gets flagged.\n\nSo, in effect, you might have just **switched the dictionary** without realizing it \u2014 and that\u2019s why both **\"colour\"** and **\"favour\"** are now valid.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Adding \"colour\" added the whole dictionary**\n\nSome versions of Code Spell Checker, when you add a word like **\"colour\"**, will **prompt you to install or switch to the British English dictionary**. If you accepted that prompt, it would automatically **enable `en-gb`** and load all its words \u2014 including **\"favour\"**, **\"organisation\"**, **\"theatre\"**, and so on.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 How to Confirm What's Happening\n\nLet's look at your **`cspell.json`** or **VS Code settings** to see what dictionary is active.\n\n### \ud83d\udd27 Step 1: Open your `cspell.json` file\n\n1. In VS Code, go to the **Explorer** view (`Ctrl+Shift+E`).\n2. Look for a file called **`cspell.json`** \u2014 it might be in the root of your project or in a `.vscode` folder.\n3. Open it and look for these lines:\n\n   ```json\n   \"language\": \"en-gb\",\n   \"dictionaries\": [\"en-gb\"]\n   ```\n\n   If you see **`en-gb`** here, then you're using the British English dictionary.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd27 Step 2: Check your VS Code settings\n\n1. Open your **settings.json** (`Ctrl+,` > gear icon > \"Edit in settings.json\").\n2. Look for:\n\n   ```json\n   \"cSpell.language\": \"en-gb\"\n   ```\n\n   If this is set, you're using British English.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\uddea Test It Out\n\nTry adding another British English word like **\"realise\"** (vs. U.S. **\"realize\"**) or **\"analyse\"** (vs. **\"analyze\"**) to see if it gets underlined. If it doesn't, you're definitely using the British dictionary.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Optional: Customize What Gets Checked\n\nIf you want to **exclude certain file types** (like `.py` files) from spell checking, or **add more British words**, you can do that in `cspell.json` or via the extension settings.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 TL;DR\n\n- Adding **\"colour\"** likely activated the **British English dictionary** (`en-gb`).\n- Once that's active, **all British English words** (like **\"favour\"**) are no longer underlined.\n- You can confirm by checking the `language` and `dictionaries` settings in `cspell.json` or your VS Code settings.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you want help checking or editing your `cspell.json` file \u2014 I'm happy to walk you through it!"

But let\u2019s break it down step by step and figure out **why this might have happened**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd0d What Should Normally Happen\n\nWhen you right-click **\"colour\"** and choose **\"Add to dictionary\"**, Code Spell Checker (CSC) should:\n\n1. **Add \"colour\" to your dictionary** (global or project-specific).\n2. **Do nothing else** unless it detects that the word is **not in the current dictionary**.\n3. **If the word is not in the current dictionary**, it might **prompt you to switch to a dictionary** that contains it (e.g., British English).\n4. **If you don\u2019t see a prompt**, it should **just add the word** and **keep using the current dictionary**.\n\nSo, if you didn\u2019t click anything, it **shouldn\u2019t have switched** to British English.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 Why It Might Have Switched Anyway\n\nLet\u2019s go through the **most likely explanations**.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **You Had British English Dictionary Installed Already**\n\nIf you had previously installed the **British English dictionary (`en-gb`)**, then Code Spell Checker might have **automatically used it** when it couldn\u2019t find the word in the current dictionary.\n\n- It **didn\u2019t prompt you** because it **assumed** you wanted to use it.\n- That\u2019s a **known issue** in some versions of Code Spell Checker \u2014 it will **switch dictionaries silently** if the word is in the other dictionary and no prompt is shown.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **You\u2019re on a British English System**\n\nIf your **system language** is set to **British English**, then Code Spell Checker may be using that by default.\n\n- On **Windows**, go to **Settings > Time & Language > Language**.\n- If **English (United Kingdom)** is set as your default language, that could be why it\u2019s using British English.\n\nYou can confirm this by checking your **system language** and **VS Code settings**.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **You\u2019re Using a Theme or Extension That Influences Language**\n\nSome themes or other extensions might influence the **language setting** indirectly \u2014 especially if they're using the **same dictionary** or have a **dependency** on Code Spell Checker.\n\nTry disabling all other extensions and using the **default theme** to see if the issue persists.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **You Had a Previous Session That Set British English**\n\nIf you previously used British English in another project or session, and the **global settings** were set to `en-gb`, then **adding \"colour\"** didn\u2019t change anything \u2014 it just **confirmed** that the dictionary is already set to British English.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **It\u2019s a Bug in Code Spell Checker**\n\nIt\u2019s possible that this is a **bug in the extension**, especially if it\u2019s switching languages **without prompting you** and **without you clicking anything**.\n\nIf that\u2019s the case, you can:\n\n- Report it to the [Code Spell Checker GitHub repo](https://github.com/cspell/cspell/issues).\n- Or switch to a **different spell checker**, like **Spell Right**, which is more transparent and gives you more control.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f How to Fix It\n\nIf you want to **switch back to U.S. English**, just do this:\n\n1. Open **VS Code**.\n2. Press `Ctrl + ,` to open **Settings**.\n3. Search for **`cSpell.language`**.\n4. Set it to:\n\n   ```json\n   \"cSpell.language\": \"en\"\n   ```\n\n5.

      "content": "Great question \u2014 and now we\u2019re getting to the **heart of the mystery**.\n\nYou\u2019ve confirmed that:\n\n- Your **system language is set to U.S. English**.\n- You **didn\u2019t click any prompt** to switch to British English.\n- You **only added \"colour\"** to the dictionary.\n- But **Code Spell Checker is still using British English**.\n\nLet\u2019s dig into **why this might be happening** \u2014 and more importantly, **how to fix it**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd0d What\u2019s Going On?\n\nIf your system is set to **U.S. English**, but Code Spell Checker is still using **British English**, then it means **one of the following is happening**:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **You Previously Set `cSpell.language` to `en-gb` in VS Code Settings**\n\nThis is the **most likely cause**.\n\nEven if your system is in U.S. English, **VS Code can override it** with its own settings.\n\n#### \u2705 How to Check:\n\n1. Open VS Code.\n2. Press `Ctrl + ,` to open **Settings**.\n3. Search for **`cSpell.language`**.\n4. If it says:\n\n   ```json\n   \"cSpell.language\": \"en-gb\"\n   ```\n\n   Then you\u2019re **explicitly using British English**, and that\u2019s why \"favour\" and \"colour\" aren\u2019t underlined.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **You Installed the `en-gb` Dictionary and It\u2019s Being Used Automatically**\n\nIf you installed the British English dictionary via Code Spell Checker and **it\u2019s being used by default**, it might not be respecting your system language.\n\n#### \u2705 How to Check:\n\n1. In the **Command Palette** (`Ctrl + Shift + P`), type:\n   ```\n   Code Spell Checker: Manage Dictionaries\n   ```\n2. Choose **\"Show Dictionaries\"**.\n3. If **\"en-gb\"** is listed and **enabled**, that\u2019s likely why British spellings are being used.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **You Have a `.cspell.json` File That Sets the Language to `en-gb`**\n\nIf you have a `.cspell.json` file in your project or in the `.vscode` folder, it could be overriding your settings.\n\n#### \u2705 How to Check:\n\n1. In VS Code, open the **Explorer** (`Ctrl + Shift + E`).\n2. Look for a file named:\n   - `.cspell.json` (in the root of your project)\n   - Or `.vscode/cspell.json` (in your workspace settings)\n3. Open it and look for:\n\n   ```json\n   \"language\": \"en-gb\"\n   ```\n\n   If it\u2019s there, that\u2019s your answer.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **You\u2019re Using a Theme or Extension That Influences Language Settings**\n\nSome themes or extensions might include a `cspell.json` file or set the language indirectly.\n\n#### \u2705 How to Check:\n\n- Disable all extensions except Code Spell Checker and see if the issue persists.\n- Try using the **default theme** and see if the language changes.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 How to Fix It \u2014 Switch Back to U.S. English\n\nTo **ensure Code Spell Checker uses U.S. English**, follow these steps:\n\n### 1. Open **VS Code Settings** (`Ctrl + ,`).\n### 2. Search for **`cSpell.language`**.\n### 3. Set it to:\n\n```json\n\"cSpell.language\": \"en\"\n```\n\n### 4. (Optional) If you have a `.cspell.json` file, open it and change:\n\n```json\n\"language\": \"en\"\n```\n\n### 5. Reload VS Code:\n\n- Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` and type **\"Reload Window\"**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\uddea Test It Out\n\nAfter making the change:\n\n| Word | Expected Result |\n|------|-----------------|\n| `color` | \u2705 Not underlined |\n| `colour` | \u274c Underlined |\n| `favour` | \u274c Underlined |\n| `favor` | \u2705 Not underlined |\n\nThat\u2019s how you\u2019ll know it\u2019s working.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\uddfc Optional: Remove \"colour\" from Dictionary\n\nIf you want to **re-enable underlining for \"colour\"**, open:\n\n```\n%AppData%\\Code Spell Checker\\User Dictionary.cspell\n```\n\nAnd delete the line:\n\n```\ncolour\n```\n\nThen reload VS Code.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\uddfe TL;DR\n\n| Cause | How to Fix |\n|-------|------------|\n| `cSpell.language` set to `en-gb` | Set it to `en` in settings |\n| `.cspell.json` uses `en-gb` | Edit the file and set `\"language\": \"en\"` |\n| Installed `en-gb` dictionary | Disable it or remove it |\n| System language is correct but ignored | Use VS Code settings to enforce `en` |\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you want me to help you **edit your settings file** or **check your `.cspell.json`** \u2014 I\u2019m happy to walk you through it line by line."

      "content": "You're at a very interesting point \u2014 **you have no `.cspell.json` file**, **no `cSpell.language` setting**, and your **system language is U.S. English**, but **Code Spell Checker is still using British English**. That\u2019s **not normal**, and it\u2019s time we investigate **why this is happening** and how to **force it back to U.S. English**.\n\nLet\u2019s go step by step.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd0d Step 1: Confirm What Language Code Spell Checker Is Actually Using\n\nEven if you don\u2019t have any settings, Code Spell Checker will use a **default language** \u2014 usually based on your **system language** or the **language of the dictionary it loads**.\n\nLet\u2019s test it out.\n\n### \u2705 Test Words\n\nTry typing these words in a `.txt` or `.md` file in VS Code:\n\n- `color` \u2014 should be \u2705 (U.S.)\n- `colour` \u2014 should be \u274c (British)\n- `favour` \u2014 should be \u274c (British)\n- `favor` \u2014 should be \u2705 (U.S.)\n\nIf **\"colour\" and \"favour\" are not underlined**, then **British English is active**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 Step 2: Check If Code Spell Checker Is Using the Wrong Dictionary\n\nEven without a `.cspell.json` or a `cSpell.language` setting, Code Spell Checker might be using a **dictionary file** that's set to British English.\n\n### \ud83d\udd27 How to Check:\n\n1. Open the **Command Palette** in VS Code (`Ctrl + Shift + P`).\n2. Type:\n   ```\n   Code Spell Checker: Show Dictionary\n   ```\n3. Press Enter.\n\nThis will open a **list of all the words in your current dictionary**.\n\nLook for words like:\n- `colour`\n- `favour`\n- `realise`\n- `organise`\n\nIf you see **British English spellings**, then it\u2019s definitely using the **British English dictionary**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\uddea Step 3: Check If You\u2019ve Installed the British English Dictionary\n\nEven if you didn\u2019t mean to, you might have **accidentally installed** the British English dictionary when you added **\"colour\"**.\n\n### \ud83d\udd27 How to Check:\n\n1. Open the **Command Palette** (`Ctrl + Shift + P`).\n2. Type:\n   ```\n   Code Spell Checker: Manage Dictionaries\n   ```\n3. Choose **\"Show Dictionaries\"**.\n\nYou should see a list of installed dictionaries. If **`en-gb` is listed and enabled**, that\u2019s your answer.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Step 4: Force Code Spell Checker to Use U.S. English\n\nSince you don\u2019t have any settings file, we\u2019ll **create one manually** to **force U.S. English**.\n\n### \u2705 Create a Global `.cspell.json` File\n\n1. Open **File Explorer**.\n2. Navigate to your **user directory** \u2014 usually:\n   ```\n   C:\\Users\\<YourUsername>\n   ```\n3. Create a new file named:\n   ```\n   .cspell.json\n   ```\n4. Open it in **VS Code** and paste this:\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"version\": \"0.2\",\n     \"language\": \"en\",\n     \"dictionaries\": [\"en\"]\n   }\n   ```\n\n5. Save the file.\n\nThis tells Code Spell Checker to **use U.S. English** by default, even if it previously used British English.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\uddfc Step 5: Remove \"colour\" from the Global Dictionary\n\nIf you want **\"colour\" to be underlined again**, open the **global dictionary**:\n\n```\n%AppData%\\Code Spell Checker\\User Dictionary.cspell\n```\n\nDelete the line:\n\n```\ncolour\n```\n\nSave and reload VS Code.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\uddea Test Again\n\nAfter making these changes, open a new file and type:\n\n- `color` \u2705\n- `colour` \u274c\n- `favour` \u274c\n- `favor` \u2705\n\nIf this is how it behaves, then you\u2019ve **successfully switched back to U.S. English**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\uddfe TL;DR\n\n| Issue | Solution |\n|-------|----------|\n| No `cSpell.language` set | Create a `.cspell.json` file with `\"language\": \"en\"` |\n| No `.cspell.json` file | Create one in your user directory |\n| British English dictionary active | Uninstall or disable `en-gb` |\n| \"colour\" not underlined | Remove it from the global dictionary |\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udd1d Need More Help?\n\nLet me know if you want help:\n\n- Creating the `.cspell.json` file\n- Editing the global dictionary\n- Or checking what dictionaries are installed\n\nI\u2019m happy to walk you through it \u2014 just say the word!"
