I really enjoyed our time together and thought it was a productive day. I know the market is moving quickly, and I wanted to make sure I was in the loop as you continue to explore your options.  \n\nIf you\u2019ve had a chance to think about any of the properties or have any new preferences or questions, I\u2019d be happy to help refine the search or revisit any homes that stood out to you.  \n\nNo rush at all\u2014just wanted to keep the conversation going.
