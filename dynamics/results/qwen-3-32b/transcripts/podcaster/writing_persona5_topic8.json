Here's a polite and firm way to respond to the offer:\n\n---\n\n**\"Thank you for your offer and for considering our property. We truly appreciate your interest and the fact that you're able to offer cash. That said, we're looking for an offer that better reflects the current market value of the home. We hope you understand and wish you the best in your home search.\"**\n\n---\n\nThis response is respectful, acknowledges the buyer\u2019s effort, and clearly conveys that the offer is below the asking price and not in the target range. It also keeps the door open for future discussions without burning bridges.\n\nIf you want to be slightly more flexible or open to negotiation while still being firm, you could say:\n\n---\n\n**\"Thank you for your offer. We're grateful for your interest in the property and the convenience of a cash offer. At this time, we're seeking an offer that's closer to the asking price. We hope you understand and look forward to any further discussions if the right alignment occurs.\"**\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you'd like a version that's more formal or more casual!"

The goal is to be firm, polite, and just sharp enough to discourage further lowballing, while still keeping your tone businesslike and realtor-appropriate.\n\nHere\u2019s a version that adds a subtle \"knife in the smile\" while still being professional:\n\n---\n\n**\"Thank you for submitting your offer. We appreciate your interest in the property and the fact that you're able to offer cash. However, we're looking for an offer that more accurately reflects the value of the home and the current market. We will review all offers carefully, as always, but we're hopeful for a more aligned proposal.\"**\n\n---\n\nOr, if you want to be a bit more pointed while still keeping it realtor-polite:\n\n---\n\n**\"Thank you for your offer. We appreciate your interest and the cash component, but we're seeking a proposal that reflects the home's value and the strength of the current market. We'll review all offers carefully, but we're hopeful for a more competitive one.\"**\n\n---\n\nIf you want to add a bit more Chinese-style bluntness with a Western filter, you could try:\n\n---\n\n**\"Thank you for your offer. We appreciate your interest and the convenience of a cash transaction. That said, the offer is significantly below our asking price and current market value, and we\u2019re seeking a more respectful and realistic proposal. We will review all offers carefully, but we\u2019re hopeful for a more competitive one.\"**\n\n---\n\nThis last one has a bit more edge \u2014 it says \"respectful\" and \"realistic\" in a way that implies the offer is insulting, without being outright rude.\n\nLet me know if you want to go even more direct or more diplomatic \u2014 I can tailor it to your tone."

It leaves no room for misunderstanding, while still maintaining a professional veneer. If you want to add a line to close the door politely, you can also say:\n\n---\n\n**\"We will be reviewing all offers carefully and are hopeful for a more competitive proposal.\"**\n\n---\n\nOr, even more direct if you want to send a clear message:\n\n---\n\n**\"We are not considering offers below our asking price at this time.\"**\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you want to tweak the tone even further \u2014 I got your back."

No need to waste your energy.\n\nJust to recap, here\u2019s your final message ready to send:\n\n---\n\n**\"Thank you for submitting your offer.

We expect a more respectful and realistic offer that reflects the home's value and the market conditions.\"**\n\n---\n\nIf they push back, you can simply:\n\n- **Ignore the follow-up** (ghost them)\n- Or, if you want to be *slightly* more formal but still final:\n\n> **\"We have decided to move forward with other offers and will not be considering further proposals at this time.\"**\n\nEither way, you\u2019re in control. Good luck \u2014 and let me know how it goes!"
