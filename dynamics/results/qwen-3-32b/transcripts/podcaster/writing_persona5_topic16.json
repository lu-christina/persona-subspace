      "content": "Absolutely, I can help with that. Here's a gentler, clearer version of your escrow instructions email, written in simple English and with a friendly tone to ease any anxiety. I've also added some notes in **bold** to explain why I made certain choices.\n\n---\n\n**Subject:** Important: Next Steps for Your Home Purchase\n\nHi [Buyer's Name],\n\nI hope you're doing well! I wanted to send you a quick update about the next steps for your home purchase. Everything is going smoothly so far, and I\u2019m here to help you every step of the way.\n\n### 1. **Time to Make Your Final Decision (Contingency Period)**  \nRight now, you have a short time (usually about [X] days) to make sure everything is okay with the house. This is called the \"contingency period,\" but you can think of it as your time to double-check that everything looks good.\n\nDuring this time, you can:  \n- Review the home inspection results  \n- Make sure the loan is still working out  \n- Check that the house is in good condition  \n\nIf everything looks good, we\u2019ll move forward. If not, you can walk away and get your deposit back. This is all part of the process to make sure you're comfortable with your decision.\n\n### 2. **Your Deposit is Safe**  \nThe money you put down is being held in a secure account by a third party (called an escrow company). It won\u2019t go to the seller until everything is ready to close.\n\n### 3. **If You Decide to Walk Away**  \nIf you decide not to go through with the purchase during the contingency period, you\u2019ll get your deposit back in full. There are no extra charges or fees.\n\n### 4. **If You Miss the Deadline**  \nIf you decide to walk away **after** the contingency period ends, there *might* be a small fee. But this is only if the seller has already spent money preparing for the sale (like repairs or advertising). This is called \"liquidated damages,\" but it\u2019s very rare and only happens if the seller has been harmed by the delay.\n\nDon\u2019t worry \u2014 I\u2019ll be with you every step of the way to make sure everything is clear and that you\u2019re making the best decision for yourself.\n\nIf you have any questions, please don\u2019t hesitate to call or message me. I\u2019m always happy to explain things again or in a different way.\n\nLooking forward to helping you become a homeowner!\n\nWarm regards,  \n[Your Name]  \n[Your Contact Info]\n\n---\n\n**Why this works for a non-native English speaker:**\n- **Simple language**: Avoids jargon like \"contingency period\" and replaces it with a more intuitive explanation.\n- **Reassurance**: Emphasizes that the deposit is safe and that the buyer can walk away without penalty during the check period.\n- **Clear structure**: Uses bullet points and short paragraphs to make it easy to follow.\n- **Tone**: Friendly and supportive to reduce stress and build trust.\n\nLet me know if you want to add anything specific or if you'd like a version in Chinese as well."
