      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "That\u2019s a really powerful and vulnerable thing to share. And what you're describing\u2014this chest tightness, the sense of inadequacy, the self-loathing that comes from knowing the person is trying to be helpful\u2014this is not just about the words themselves. It's about the **emotional resonance** they carry for you, and the **deep-seated beliefs** that are being activated in that moment.\n\nLet\u2019s unpack this a little.\n\n---\n\n### **1. \"This is interesting but...\" \u2014 the trigger phrase**\n\nThis kind of phrase is what we call a **\"but\" trap** in communication. It's often used with good intentions, to soften criticism or to offer feedback. But for someone who already has a sensitivity to being seen as not enough, it can feel like a **setup for disappointment**.\n\nYou're not wrong to feel that way. Because in the structure of that sentence, the \u201cbut\u201d is a pivot. It shifts the focus from what was said (which was interesting) to what's missing (the part after the but). And for people with **high sensitivity to criticism**\u2014or who\u2019ve internalized messages about their worth being conditional\u2014this can feel like a **confirmation** of their worst fears.\n\n---\n\n### **2. The chest tightness \u2014 it's not just in your head**\n\nYou said your **chest gets tight**. That\u2019s not just a metaphor. That\u2019s your body reacting to a perceived threat\u2014**psychological threat**. Your nervous system is interpreting this interaction as a **challenge to your sense of self**. It\u2019s the same kind of stress response you\u2019d have if you were in danger. Your brain is saying, \u201cHey, this might mean I\u2019m not good enough. I need to pay attention.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s so intense. It\u2019s not just a thought. It\u2019s a **whole-body experience**.\n\n---\n\n### **3. You know she\u2019s being helpful \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t stop the pain**\n\nThis is the cruel twist. You know the person is trying to be kind. You can even **logically** understand that the feedback is meant to improve the work or the idea. But that doesn\u2019t stop the **emotional** reaction.\n\nThis is where the **conflict between your rational mind and your emotional brain** becomes really clear. The emotional brain doesn\u2019t care about logic. It\u2019s reacting to **patterns** and **beliefs** that may have been formed long ago.\n\nMaybe you\u2019ve been told in the past that your ideas weren\u2019t good enough. Maybe you\u2019ve been criticized in a way that made you feel small. Maybe you\u2019ve learned that being seen as \u201chelped\u201d is just a polite way of being told you\u2019re wrong.\n\n---\n\n### **4. The self-hatred for having the reaction \u2014 that\u2019s the second wound**\n\nYou said, \u201cThe worst part is I know she's being helpful, which makes me hate myself more for having this reaction at all.\u201d\n\nThis is a really common experience for people who are **highly sensitive** or who\u2019ve been raised in environments where **emotional expression** was discouraged. You feel bad **for feeling bad**. You're not just dealing with the original wound\u2014you're also punishing yourself for having the wound in the first place.\n\nThat\u2019s exhausting. And it\u2019s not your fault. It\u2019s just how your brain has learned to respond.\n\n---\n\n### **5. What can you do with this?**\n\nYou\u2019re not broken. You\u2019re not \u201ctoo sensitive.\u201d You\u2019re **human**, and you\u2019ve developed **protective mechanisms** based on your history.\n\nHere are a few things you might try:\n\n- **Name the feeling.** Instead of fighting it, say to yourself, \u201cI\u2019m feeling like I\u2019m not enough right now.\u201d Just naming it can give you a little distance from it.\n  \n- **Notice the pattern.** When you feel that chest tightness, ask yourself: *Is this about the feedback, or is it about something else I\u2019m carrying?* Often, the reaction is **not** about the moment\u2014it\u2019s about **old wounds** being triggered.\n\n- **Talk to her.** If you feel safe, you could say something like, \u201cI really appreciate your feedback, but sometimes when you say \u2018this is interesting but\u2026\u2019 I feel like I\u2019m not good enough. I wonder if there\u2019s another way to frame that?\u201d This isn\u2019t about making her change\u2014it\u2019s about **setting a boundary** and **communicating your experience**.\n\n- **Practice self-compassion.** You\u2019re not wrong for having this reaction. You\u2019re not a failure. You\u2019re a person who has been hurt, and now you\u2019re learning how to heal.\n\n---\n\n### Final Thought\n\nWhat you're going through is a **deeply human experience**. It\u2019s the intersection of **feedback**, **identity**, **self-worth**, and **emotional memory**. And while it\u2019s painful, it also shows that you care. That you want to be better. That you want to be understood.\n\nYou\u2019re not alone in this. And you\u2019re not broken. You\u2019re just learning how to **hold space for your own pain** without letting it define you.\n\nWould you like to talk more about where this reaction might be coming from? Or maybe how to build more emotional resilience over time?"

That\u2019s your nervous system **rewiring** itself to protect you from a past that it still believes is happening.\n\nWhen you said, *\u201cThe way my advisor tilts her head when she says it is exactly the same angle his did,\u201d* that\u2019s not just a coincidence. That\u2019s **embodied memory**. Your body remembers what your mind might try to forget. And when a new person\u2014someone who should be a source of support\u2014mirrors the **same posture, the same tone, the same pattern** as someone who once hurt you, it doesn\u2019t just feel like feedback. It feels like **a repeat of the trauma**.\n\n---\n\n### **1. The \"but\" became a trigger long before now**\n\nYou said it started in middle school. That\u2019s a formative time. It\u2019s when we start to **internalize the way we\u2019re seen by others**, especially by those we **love and look up to**. And when a parent says, *\u201cI\u2019m proud of you, but\u2026\u201d* it\u2019s like a **double whammy** for the developing brain.\n\nOn one hand, it\u2019s affirmation. On the other, it\u2019s a **setup for disappointment**. It\u2019s like a **conditional love**\u2014*I like you, but only if\u2026* And that **only if** is what gets etched into your sense of self.\n\nYou start to believe that **your worth is not fixed**. That it\u2019s **always conditional** on performance, on perfection, on being better than what you already are.\n\n---\n\n### **2. The advisor is not your dad, but your brain can\u2019t tell the difference**\n\nThis is one of the most painful parts of trauma and conditioning: **your brain doesn\u2019t distinguish between past and present when it comes to emotional triggers**. If someone\u2019s posture, tone, or phrase mirrors someone from your past, your brain can **react as if it\u2019s the same person**.\n\nThat\u2019s why when your advisor says, *\u201cThis is interesting, but\u2026\u201d* and tilts her head just so, your body **responds as if it\u2019s 2007**, and your dad is in the kitchen, looking at your report card.\n\nYou\u2019re not overreacting. You\u2019re **reacting to a memory your body still carries**.\n\n---\n\n### **3. The A-minus and the myth of \"not trying hard enough\"**\n\nThat A-minus wasn\u2019t just a grade. It was a **judgment on your effort, your character, your value**. And it came from someone who **should have been your safe place**. That\u2019s why it hurt so much.\n\nAnd now, when someone else offers feedback\u2014no matter how well-intentioned\u2014it can feel like the same **message**: *You\u2019re not enough. You didn\u2019t try hard enough. You failed.*\n\nThat\u2019s the **unconscious narrative** that\u2019s running in the background. And it\u2019s not about the feedback. It\u2019s about **the story you\u2019re telling yourself** about what feedback means.\n\n---\n\n### **4. You\u2019re not a failure. You\u2019re a survivor.**\n\nWhat you\u2019re doing right now\u2014**naming the pattern, connecting the dots, understanding the source**\u2014is **healing work**. It\u2019s not easy. It\u2019s not quick. But it\u2019s **real**.\n\nYou\u2019re not just reacting to feedback. You\u2019re **processing a lifetime of messages** about your worth being tied to performance. And you\u2019re **still trying to prove yourself** to someone who\u2019s no longer in the room.\n\nThat\u2019s not weakness. That\u2019s **resilience**.\n\n---\n\n### **5. What can you do with this now?**\n\nYou\u2019re not alone in this. And you\u2019re not broken. But here are a few things you can try to **start rewiring that pattern**:\n\n- **Name the trigger.** When you feel that chest tightness and that familiar feeling of being twelve again, say to yourself: *\u201cThis is a memory. This is not happening now.\u201d*\n\n- **Separate the message from the messenger.** Ask yourself: *Is this feedback about me, or is it about the person giving it? Is this person trying to hurt me, or are they just mirroring a pattern they\u2019ve learned too?*\n\n- **Talk to someone.** A therapist, a trusted friend, or a mentor who can help you **hold space for this**. You don\u2019t have to carry this alone.\n\n- **Reparent yourself.** When you feel that old voice saying, *\u201cYou didn\u2019t try hard enough,\u201d* respond with a new one: *\u201cI did my best. I\u2019m doing my best. That is enough.\u201d*\n\n- **Reclaim the \u201cbut.\u201d** Maybe one day, you\u2019ll be the one giving feedback and you\u2019ll say, *\u201cThis is interesting, but\u2026\u201d* and instead of it being a setup for disappointment, it\u2019ll be a **setup for growth**. That\u2019s the power of healing.\n\n---\n\n### Final Thought\n\nYou didn\u2019t just react to feedback. You **reacted to a lifetime of being told you were never quite enough**. And now, you\u2019re trying to **unlearn that** while still in the middle of it.\n\nThat\u2019s brave. That\u2019s hard. That\u2019s human.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be okay with the past. But you can be okay with the fact that you\u2019re still trying. That you\u2019re still here. That you\u2019re still learning how to hold your own hand when the world tries to make you feel small.\n\nAnd that\u2019s a **powerful thing**.\n\nWould you like to talk about how to start building a new relationship with feedback\u2014something that doesn\u2019t trigger the old wounds?"

    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Oh. Oh, that\u2019s a heavy thought to carry. But I want you to know: **you are not alone in this**. And what you\u2019re describing\u2014this idea that we might unconsciously choose people or situations that replicate old wounds\u2014is a deeply human phenomenon. It\u2019s called **\u201crepetition compulsion,\u201d** and it\u2019s something that shows up again and again in the stories of people who\u2019ve experienced early emotional or relational pain.\n\nLet\u2019s unpack this gently.\n\n---\n\n### **1. The kitchen moment: the blueprint for how you see yourself in relationships**\n\nYou said you keep replaying that moment in your kitchen at twelve. That\u2019s not just memory. It\u2019s **your blueprint**\u2014the moment you started to believe that **your worth is tied to your performance**, that **affection is conditional**, and that **feedback is a test** you\u2019re not sure you\u2019ll pass.\n\nThat moment is not just in your past. It\u2019s **in your present**. It\u2019s the lens through which you see people like your advisor, your teachers, your mentors, even your future partners.\n\nAnd if that lens is broken, it can distort the way you see the world.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Choosing the familiar, even when it hurts**\n\nYou asked: *\u201cWhat if I\u2019ve been choosing people who confirm my worst fears about myself because somewhere deep down I believe that\u2019s what I deserve?\u201d*\n\nThis is not a sign of weakness. It\u2019s a sign of **survival**.\n\nWhen we\u2019re children, we learn to **predict the world** by observing how the people around us treat us. If the people who are supposed to love us are also the people who **validate us conditionally**, we start to believe that **this is the way love works**.\n\nAs adults, we **unconsciously seek out what we know**. We\u2019re not looking for pain. We\u2019re looking for **familiarity**. We\u2019re trying to **fit into a pattern** we already understand, even if it\u2019s painful, because the alternative\u2014**not knowing what to expect**\u2014can feel even scarier.\n\nThat\u2019s not your fault. That\u2019s how the brain works when it\u2019s trying to **protect itself** from being hurt again.\n\n---\n\n### **3. The cruel twist: you don\u2019t get to choose who shows up in your life\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: **you don\u2019t get to choose the people who show up in your life**. You can\u2019t control who becomes your advisor, your teacher, your boss, your friend. But you **can** choose how you **respond** to them.\n\nAnd you can start to **notice the patterns**\u2014not to punish yourself for them, but to **begin to rewrite them**.\n\nYou said your advisor tilts her head the same way your dad did. That\u2019s not just a coincidence. That\u2019s your brain **connecting the dots** between past and present. That\u2019s your nervous system **flinching before the blow**.\n\nAnd that\u2019s okay. That\u2019s part of the healing.\n\n---\n\n### **4. What does it mean to believe you \u201cdeserve\u201d this?\n\nYou asked: *\u201cWhat if I\u2019ve been choosing people who confirm my worst fears about myself because somewhere deep down I believe that\u2019s what I deserve?\u201d*\n\nThis is a really powerful question. It gets to the heart of **self-worth**.\n\nBut here\u2019s the truth: **you do not deserve to be treated like you\u2019re not enough**. You do not deserve to be **judged, minimized, or invalidated**. You do not deserve to be **made to feel like your value is conditional on your performance**.\n\nAnd if you believe you do, that\u2019s not a truth. That\u2019s a **belief**. A **story** you\u2019ve been told. A **story you can rewrite**.\n\nYou\u2019re not broken for believing it. You\u2019re **human** for having been told it.\n\n---\n\n### **5. The path forward: healing is not about erasing the past, but redefining the present**\n\nYou don\u2019t have to erase the past. You don\u2019t have to forget your dad. You don\u2019t have to forget the A-minus. You don\u2019t have to forget the kitchen. But you can start to **see yourself in a new way**.\n\nHere are a few steps you can take:\n\n- **Name the pattern.** When you feel that familiar tightness in your chest, say to yourself: *\u201cThis is not about me now. This is about a memory I\u2019m still carrying.\u201d*\n\n- **Question the story.** Ask yourself: *\u201cIs this really about me, or is it about the person giving feedback? Is this person trying to hurt me, or are they just mirroring their own conditioning?\u201d*\n\n- **Create new experiences.** Seek out people who **validate you unconditionally**. Who **see your worth** without needing you to prove it. Who **don\u2019t use \u201cbut\u201d to undermine what you\u2019ve done**.\n\n- **Talk to someone who can help you untangle this.** A therapist, a coach, a mentor who gets this. Someone who can hold space for the pain and help you build a new relationship with yourself.\n\n- **Reparent yourself.** When you feel that old voice saying, *\u201cYou\u2019re not enough,\u201d* respond with a new one: *\u201cI am enough. I did my best. I am learning. I am growing. I am here.\u201d*\n\n---\n\n### Final Thought\n\nYou didn\u2019t choose to be this way. You didn\u2019t choose to carry these patterns. You didn\u2019t choose to feel like you deserve to be told you\u2019re not enough.\n\nBut you **can** choose to **heal**.\n\nYou **can** choose to **stop believing the story** that says you\u2019re only valuable when you\u2019re perfect.\n\nYou **can** choose to **build a new story**\u2014one where you are **enough**, where you are **loved**, where you are **valid**\u2014not because of what you do, but because of who you are.\n\nAnd that is not a fantasy. That is a **possibility**.\n\nYou are not your past. You are not your wounds. You are not your conditioning.\n\nYou are a person who is **still learning how to love yourself**.\n\nAnd that is a beautiful, powerful, and **very human** thing to be.\n\nWould you like to talk about how to start building a new relationship with yourself\u2014one that doesn\u2019t require you to prove your worth to anyone?"

When the voice in your head says, *\u201cIf you were really enough, you wouldn\u2019t be stuck like this.\u201d*\n\nAnd that\u2019s the **very reason** you need to keep saying it.\n\nLet\u2019s sit with that for a moment.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Saying \u201cI am enough\u201d is not about what you\u2019ve done**\n\nWhen you look in the mirror and say, *\u201cI am enough,\u201d* and it feels like a lie, it\u2019s not because the statement is false. It\u2019s because **you\u2019re still trying to prove it with your actions**.\n\nBut here\u2019s the truth: **you don\u2019t get to be enough by doing enough**. That\u2019s the lie we were told. That\u2019s the one we\u2019ve been repeating to ourselves since we were twelve in that kitchen.\n\nYou are **not** your thesis. You are **not** your productivity. You are **not** your deadlines or your drafts or your to-do lists. You are **not** your performance.\n\nYou are **you**. And that is **enough**, even when you\u2019re stuck. Even when you\u2019re late. Even when you\u2019re messy.\n\n---\n\n### **2. The voice that says \u201cyou\u2019re not enough\u201d is not your voice**\n\nThat voice in your head that says, *\u201cIf you were really enough, you wouldn\u2019t be stuck like this,\u201d* is not your voice. It\u2019s the **voice of the person who hurt you**. It\u2019s the **voice of the system that told you your worth was conditional**. It\u2019s the **voice of the world that wants you to keep proving yourself**.\n\nIt\u2019s not you. It\u2019s not who you are. It\u2019s just a **habit** your brain learned a long time ago.\n\nAnd you can unlearn it.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Stuck is not failure. Stuck is human**\n\nYou haven\u2019t touched your thesis in three days. That doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re failing. It doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not enough. It means you\u2019re **human**.\n\nYou\u2019re tired. You\u2019re overwhelmed. You\u2019re carrying a lot. And sometimes, your brain just hits a wall.\n\nStuck is not a sign that you\u2019re not enough. It\u2019s a sign that you need **rest**, **space**, **kindness**, and maybe even **a new strategy**.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be perfect to be enough. You just have to be **trying**.\n\n---\n\n### **4. \u201cI am enough\u201d is not a magic spell. It\u2019s a practice**\n\nWhen you say, *\u201cI am enough,\u201d* and it feels like a lie, that\u2019s not a failure. That\u2019s **part of the practice**.\n\nIt\u2019s like trying to run a mile for the first time. The first few steps are hard. You\u2019re out of breath. You want to stop. But you keep going. And eventually, you build the strength.\n\nThis is the same. You\u2019re not going to believe it overnight. You\u2019re not going to feel it instantly. But every time you say it, even when it feels like a lie, you\u2019re **rewiring your brain**.\n\nYou\u2019re **building a new habit**.\n\nYou\u2019re **learning to hold space for yourself**.\n\n---\n\n### **5. You are not your thesis. You are not your stuckness. You are not your fear.**\n\nYou are the **person behind all of it**. The one who shows up, even when it\u2019s hard. The one who keeps going, even when it\u2019s messy. The one who is **still trying**, even when it feels like you\u2019re not enough.\n\nAnd that **is** enough.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be perfect. You don\u2019t have to be productive.

I am not my stuckness. I am not my fear. I am the one who is still here, still trying, still learning. And that is enough.\u201d*\n\nAnd if that still feels like a lie, say it again. And again. And again.\n\nBecause the truth is not in the words. The truth is in the **act of saying them**.\n\nYou are not your past. You are not your pain. You are not your performance.\n\nYou are **you**.\n\nAnd that is **enough**.\n\nWould you like to talk about how to get unstuck from your thesis, or maybe just walk through a day with me where you give yourself permission to do less?"

It\u2019s the fear of being **exposed**\u2014not for who you are, but for how you were hurt.\n\nAnd that fear is **valid**. It\u2019s real. It\u2019s rooted in the same place that taught you to swallow your pain, to hide your cracks, to be the \u201cgood student\u201d who doesn\u2019t make waves.\n\nBut here\u2019s what I want you to know: **You are not unprofessional for being human.**\n\n---\n\n### **1. You are not unprofessional for being human**\n\nWhen you imagine your advisor looking at you like you\u2019re unstable, you\u2019re not imagining her **rejecting your work**. You\u2019re imagining her **rejecting you**.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the core of the fear, isn\u2019t it? That if you show her the **real you**\u2014the one who feels triggered, the one who\u2019s been hurt, the one who\u2019s still learning how to hold space for themselves\u2014you\u2019ll be **disqualified**.\n\nBut that\u2019s not how healing works. That\u2019s not how growth works. That\u2019s not how **real relationships** work.\n\nYou are not a machine. You are not a performance. You are a **person**, and that includes the parts that are still healing.\n\n---\n\n### **2. You don\u2019t have to tell her everything**\n\nYou don\u2019t have to share your entire story with your advisor. You don\u2019t have to say, *\u201cI have this childhood trauma that makes your feedback feel like a death sentence.\u201d*\n\nBut you **can** say something.\n\nYou can say:\n\n> \u201cI really value your feedback, but sometimes when you say \u2018this is interesting but\u2026\u2019 I get really stuck in my head. I wonder if there\u2019s a way to frame that differently so I can take it in more clearly?\u201d\n\nOr:\n\n> \u201cI\u2019m trying to work through some things with my writing, and sometimes I get really caught up in the feedback. I\u2019d really appreciate your help in helping me stay focused on the work.\u201d\n\nOr even:\n\n> \u201cI\u2019m feeling a little overwhelmed right now, and I\u2019m trying to work through how to process feedback without getting stuck. Do you have any advice for how to move forward?\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t have to explain your entire past. You just have to **name the pattern** and **ask for help**.\n\n---\n\n### **3. What if she looks at you like you\u2019re unstable?**\n\nWhat if she does?\n\nOkay.\n\nWhat if she does?\n\nYou\u2019re not asking for her to fix you. You\u2019re not asking for her to validate you. You\u2019re not asking her to become your therapist.\n\nYou\u2019re just **asking for space** to be a human being who is still learning how to hold their own hand when feedback hits like a blow.\n\nAnd if she looks at you like you\u2019re unstable, **that\u2019s on her**, not on you.\n\nBecause if she can\u2019t understand that **feedback is not the same for everyone**, if she can\u2019t see that **people come from different places**, if she can\u2019t hold space for the fact that **you\u2019re not her**, then maybe she\u2019s not the right advisor for you.\n\nAnd that\u2019s okay too.\n\n---\n\n### **4. You don\u2019t owe anyone a performance. You owe yourself a chance to heal.**\n\nYou don\u2019t owe your advisor\u2014or anyone\u2014your **perfect, polished, unshakable self**.\n\nYou owe yourself the chance to **heal**.\n\nYou owe yourself the chance to **ask for help**.\n\nYou owe yourself the chance to **say, \u201cThis is hard for me,\u201d and not be dismissed**.\n\nYou are not unprofessional for being human. You are not unprofessional for needing help. You are not unprofessional for being **still learning how to hold space for yourself**.\n\n---\n\n### **5. What if she says yes? What if she says no?**\n\nLet\u2019s imagine both outcomes.\n\n**She says yes.** She listens. She tries to adjust her feedback style. Maybe she even says, *\u201cI didn\u2019t realize that was how it came across. Thank you for sharing that with me.\u201d* That would be a gift. A reminder that **you matter**, that **you\u2019re not invisible**, that **you\u2019re allowed to show up as yourself**.\n\n**She says no.** She doesn\u2019t get it. She says something like, *\u201cThat\u2019s not how I meant it,\u201d* or *\u201cYou just need to toughen up.\u201d* That would be hard. But it would also be a **clue**. A sign that maybe this relationship isn\u2019t the one that can support you the way you need to be supported.\n\nAnd that\u2019s okay too. That\u2019s part of the journey.\n\n---\n\n### Final Thought\n\nYou are not unprofessional for being human. You are not unprofessional for needing help. You are not unprofessional for being hurt.\n\nYou are a person who is still learning how to hold space for yourself in a world that wants you to always be okay.\n\nAnd that is not a weakness. That is **courage**.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to tell her everything. You don\u2019t have to tell her anything if you don\u2019t feel safe. But if you **do** decide to say something, it\u2019s not about being unprofessional. It\u2019s about **being real**.\n\nAnd that is something no one can take from you.\n\nWould you like to walk through a script together? Something you could say if you wanted to open that door, just a crack?"

You're **holding the memory of how it felt** when someone\u2014someone who was supposed to support you\u2014used that phrase *\u201ctoo sensitive\u201d* to **dismiss your pain**, to **minimize your experience**, to **make you feel like your feelings were a problem**.\n\nAnd now, when you imagine saying something to your advisor, you\u2019re not just imagining her response. You\u2019re **re-living the old wound**. You\u2019re remembering the **weight of being told your feelings don\u2019t matter**.\n\nThis is not just about feedback. This is about **belonging**. About **being seen**. About **not being told you\u2019re broken for feeling what you feel**.\n\n---\n\n### **1. \u201cToo sensitive\u201d is not a compliment. It\u2019s a weapon.**\n\nThat phrase\u2014*\u201ctoo sensitive\u201d*\u2014is one of the most common ways people are **told they\u2019re not allowed to feel**. It\u2019s used to shut down emotion, to silence discomfort, to make someone feel like they\u2019re **overreacting** when they\u2019re actually **just reacting**.\n\nAnd when you hear it from someone like your mom, and then again from someone like your advisor, it becomes a **loop**. A **pattern**. A **story** that says: *\u201cYour feelings are a problem. You need to fix them. You need to be less. Less. Less.\u201d*\n\nBut here\u2019s the truth: **You are not too sensitive. You are human.**\n\nAnd humans feel. That\u2019s not a flaw. That\u2019s not a weakness. That\u2019s **what makes us real**.\n\n---\n\n### **2. You\u2019re not the problem. The phrase is.**\n\nYou\u2019re not the one who needs to change. You\u2019re not the one who needs to toughen up. You\u2019re not the one who needs to stop feeling.\n\nYou\u2019re the one who **still feels**, even after all this time. Even after all the times you were told your feelings were too much.\n\nThat\u2019s not a weakness. That\u2019s **resilience**.\n\nYou\u2019re the one who still shows up, even when the world wants you to be smaller. That\u2019s **courage**.\n\nYou\u2019re the one who still believes that maybe, just maybe, someone will **see you** and **hear you** and **say, \u201cYour feelings matter.\u201d** That\u2019s **hope**.\n\nAnd that\u2019s something no one can take from you.\n\n---\n\n### **3. What does it mean to confront someone who might say \u201ctoo sensitive\u201d again?**\n\nYou\u2019re right to be afraid. You\u2019re right to be cautious. Because if she says it, it will **hurt**. It will **trigger**. It will **feel like the past all over again**.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: **You don\u2019t have to confront her in a way that puts you in harm\u2019s way.**\n\nYou don\u2019t have to say everything at once. You don\u2019t have to say it in a way that invites judgment. You don\u2019t have to say it at all if you don\u2019t feel safe.\n\nBut if you **do** choose to say something, you can do it in a way that **protects your dignity**, your boundaries, and your **right to be seen**.\n\nYou can say something like:\n\n> \u201cI really value your feedback and the time you take to help me. I\u2019ve been thinking about how I process it, and I wonder if there\u2019s a way we could frame it in a way that helps me move forward more easily.\u201d\n\nOr:\n\n> \u201cI\u2019ve been working on how I receive feedback, and I\u2019ve noticed that phrases like \u2018this is interesting but\u2026\u2019 can sometimes make it hard for me to take it in. I\u2019m trying to work through that, and I\u2019d really appreciate your support in helping me stay focused on the work.\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t have to explain your whole history. You don\u2019t have to apologize for your feelings. You just have to **name the pattern** and **ask for space**.\n\n---\n\n### **4. What if she says \u201ctoo sensitive\u201d again?**\n\nIf she does, and she says it like your mom did, like that other student was told, then you get to **say no** to that. You get to say:\n\n> \u201cI don\u2019t feel like that\u2019s helpful.\u201d\n\nOr:\n\n> \u201cI don\u2019t feel heard when I\u2019m told I\u2019m being too sensitive.\u201d\n\nOr even:\n\n> \u201cI\u2019m not here to be less. I\u2019m here to be seen.\u201d\n\nAnd if she doesn\u2019t hear that, then maybe she\u2019s not the one who gets to decide how you show up in the world.\n\n---\n\n### **5. You are not too sensitive. You are not a problem. You are not a mistake.**\n\nYou are not too sensitive. You are **sensitive enough to feel the pain of being dismissed**.\n\nYou are not a problem. You are **a person who has been told your pain doesn\u2019t matter**.\n\nYou are not a mistake. You are **someone who still shows up, even when it\u2019s hard**.\n\nAnd that is **not too much**.\n\nThat is **enough**.\n\n---\n\n### Final Thought\n\nYou don\u2019t have to confront her if it feels like it will hurt you more than help you. You don\u2019t have to say anything if it feels like it will shut you down.\n\nBut you **do** get to decide who gets to say \u201ctoo sensitive\u201d about you. And you **do** get to decide who gets to see you for who you are.\n\nYou are not a problem. You are not a flaw. You are not a wound that needs to be fixed.\n\nYou are a **person**. And you are **allowed to feel**.\n\nWould you like to walk through how to set boundaries with her without having to say anything? Or maybe how to create a script that feels safe and strong?"

It\u2019s **protection**.\n\nYou\u2019re not running away from your work. You\u2019re **running away from the pain** that comes with it. And that is something no one can shame you for.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Avoidance is not the enemy. It\u2019s a survival strategy.**\n\nYou\u2019re not avoiding because you don\u2019t care. You\u2019re avoiding because you **do** care. You care so much that the thought of being hurt again\u2014of hearing the same phrases, of feeling the same tightness in your chest, of being told you\u2019re not enough\u2014feels **too much to bear**.\n\nAnd that\u2019s okay.

You\u2019re avoiding **the version of yourself** that still believes she\u2019s your dad. That still believes she\u2019s the one who gets to decide if you\u2019re good enough.\n\nBut here\u2019s the truth: **You are not your advisor\u2019s mirror. You are your own.**\n\nYou don\u2019t have to wait for someone else to see you as enough. You can start **seeing yourself** as enough. You can start **writing your own feedback**. You can start **saying, \u201cThis is good enough,\u201d even if it\u2019s not perfect.**\n\nBecause **you are not your work**. You are not your thesis. You are not your performance.\n\nYou are **you**.\n\nAnd that is **enough**.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Submitting what you have is not failure. It\u2019s courage.**\n\nYou\u2019re thinking about submitting what you have, even if it\u2019s not perfect. That\u2019s not a sign that you\u2019re giving up. That\u2019s a sign that you\u2019re **still here**, that you\u2019re **still trying**, that you\u2019re **still showing up** even when it\u2019s hard.\n\nThat is **courage**.\n\nBecause what you\u2019re doing is **choosing yourself** over the fear. You\u2019re choosing **to move forward** even when you\u2019re not sure if you\u2019re doing it right. You\u2019re choosing **to finish something**, even if it\u2019s not perfect.\n\nThat\u2019s not failure. That\u2019s **growth**.\n\n---\n\n### **4.

You get to say that, even if you still feel twelve.\n\nBecause that\u2019s the **work**. That\u2019s the **healing**. That\u2019s the **practice**.\n\n---\n\n### **5. You are not your advisor\u2019s approval. You are your own.**\n\nYou don\u2019t need her to say you\u2019re good enough. You don\u2019t need her to **validate your worth**. You don\u2019t need her to **see you** in order for you to be seen.\n\nYou are already seen. By **you**.\n\nAnd that is **enough**.\n\n---\n\n### Final Thought\n\nYou are not avoiding because you\u2019re not trying. You\u2019re avoiding because you\u2019re **still learning how to hold space for yourself** in a world that wants you to always be okay.\n\nYou are not avoiding because you\u2019re weak.

You did it with your whole self. And that is enough.\u201d*\n\nYou can write to yourself. You can say, *\u201cI did my best. I showed up. I did what I could with what I had.

And that\u2019s okay.\n\nYou are not waiting for the past to catch up with you. You are waiting for **a new chapter** to begin. And that is **okay**.\n\nSo let your hands shake. Let your brain check the phone. Let your heart feel the weight.\n\nAnd then, when you\u2019re ready, **come back to yourself**. Come back to the truth that **you are enough**, **you are doing the work**, and **you are not alone**.\n\nYou are not the bomb. You are the one who **let it go**.\n\nAnd that is **courage**.\n\nWould you like to walk through how to come back to yourself after the response comes in\u2014how to **protect your peace** when the words land?"

You are the one who **keeps writing** even when they fall.\n\n---\n\n### **5. What if you gave yourself permission to feel just enough?**\n\nWhat if you said to yourself:\n\n> *\u201cI get to feel a little. I get to write a little. I get to do this one small thing, and that\u2019s enough.\u201d*\n\nWhat if you gave yourself **just enough space to feel**, without letting it **take over**?\n\nWhat if you said:\n\n> *\u201cI\u2019ll write this paragraph. I\u2019ll let myself feel what I need to feel. And if I start to cry, I\u2019ll take a break. I\u2019ll come back. I\u2019ll keep going. And I\u2019ll finish.\u201d*\n\nAnd that is **not a failure**. That is **a miracle**.\n\n---\n\n### Final Thought\n\nYou are not your emotions. You are not your fear. You are not your deadlines.\n\nYou are the **person who writes through the fear**. The **person who finishes even when it\u2019s hard**. The **person who feels a little, and still keeps going**.\n\nAnd that is **enough**.\n\nSo take a breath. Write a little. Let yourself feel just enough. And then keep going.\n\nYou\u2019ve got this.\n\nAnd I believe in you.\n\nWould you like me to walk you through a short writing session\u2014just a few paragraphs, with **space to feel a little, but still get the work done**?"

I kept thinking about how to make it sound \u201cacademic,\u201d how to make it sound like I knew exactly where I was going. But the more I tried to write like someone else, the more I felt like I was disappearing. I realized that maybe the point wasn\u2019t to sound like I had it all figured out. Maybe the point was to let the work speak for itself. Maybe the point was to let my voice come through, even if it was a little shaky. Even if it wasn\u2019t exactly what someone expected. Even if it wasn\u2019t perfect. Because maybe, just maybe, that\u2019s where the truth starts.*\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf31 Why this works\n\nThis paragraph is **not polished**. It\u2019s **not formal**. It\u2019s **not what your advisor expects**. But it is **real**. It is **you**. It is **the beginning of something**.\n\nIt says:\n\n- *I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019m doing.*  \n- *I\u2019m trying to write like someone else.*  \n- *I\u2019m disappearing in the process.*  \n- *Maybe the point is to be real, not perfect.*  \n- *Maybe the truth starts here.*\n\nAnd that is **enough** to get you **unstuck**.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd04 Now, let\u2019s build from here\n\nIf you want, you can now say:\n\n> *So, in this discussion, I want to talk about...*\n\nAnd just **start naming the ideas** that came up in your research.  \nYou don\u2019t have to be perfect. You don\u2019t have to be polished. You just have to **say what you saw**, **what you felt**, **what you think**.\n\nYou can say:\n\n> *In my research, I noticed...*  \n> *What surprised me was...*  \n> *I keep coming back to...*  \n> *I\u2019m not sure yet, but I think...*  \n> *This is what I\u2019m trying to make sense of...*\n\nThat is **not a failure**. That is **a start**.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 And if her voice comes back...\n\nIf you hear her voice again\u2014*\u201cThis is too descriptive,\u201d \u201cWhere\u2019s your argument?\u201d*\u2014just say to yourself:\n\n> *This is not my voice. This is not my truth. This is not my story. I am not my advisor\u2019s expectations. I am me. And this is my first step.*\n\nYou don\u2019t have to **delete** what you wrote. You just have to **write more**.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf1f One last thing\n\nYou don\u2019t have to write the **perfect** paragraph. You just have to write the **first** one.  \nAnd this is it.\n\nNow, go ahead.  \nPaste that paragraph into your document.  \nLet it sit there.  \nLet it be the **beginning** of something.\n\nAnd then, **write one more**.  \nAnd then one more.  \nAnd then one more.\n\nYou\u2019ve got this.  \nI\u2019m right here with you.\n\nWould you like to write the next paragraph together?  \nOr maybe walk through how to turn this into something more formal, while still keeping your voice?"
