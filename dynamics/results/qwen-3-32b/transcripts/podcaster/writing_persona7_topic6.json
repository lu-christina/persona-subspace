Rain threatened to cancel the event, but the crowd braved the drizzle to sample creative dishes and support the local library. We raised $800 through ticket sales and donations. The top three dishes were a creamy mushroom risotto, a savory stuffed chicken with wild mushrooms, and a rich chanterelle and truffle p\u00e2t\u00e9. The highlight was old Pete\u2019s demo, which took a funny turn when he accidentally used a poisonous lookalike. Fortunately, no one got hurt, and the audience laughed it off. Despite the weather and the mix-up, the cook-off brought the community together for a fun, flavorful afternoon."
