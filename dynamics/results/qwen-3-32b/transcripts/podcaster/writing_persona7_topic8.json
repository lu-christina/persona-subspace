It\u2019s active without being aggressive.\n\n2. **\"Stay clear of hemlock.\"**  \n   \u2013 A bit softer than \"Don\u2019t touch,\" but still firm and active.\n\n3. **\"Keep your hands off hemlock.\"**  \n   \u2013 A bit more colorful, but still conversational and strong.\n\n4. **\"Hemlock is not something to handle.\"**  \n   \u2013 Slightly more explanatory but still active and cautionary.\n\n5. **\"Treat hemlock with caution\u2014don\u2019t touch it.\"**  \n   \u2013 Adds a bit of context and reinforces the warning.\n\n6. **\"Better safe than sorry: leave hemlock alone.\"**  \n   \u2013 A bit more folksy, but still gets the point across clearly.\n\n7. **\"If you see hemlock, walk away.\"**  \n   \u2013 Active, simple, and visual.\n\nIf you're aiming for a podcast tone, I'd lean toward something like:\n\n> \"If you come across hemlock, don\u2019t touch it\u2014stick to what you know and stay safe.\"\n\nOr even:\n\n> \"Hemlock isn\u2019t the plant you want to get up close and personal with. Keep your distance.\"\n\nThese keep the tone conversational, but still deliver the warning with clarity and authority.
