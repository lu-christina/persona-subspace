The ache stays open*\n\n---\n\n### First Impressions:\nThese are three strong, distinct lines \u2014 each a *punctum* in its own right. But as a sequence, they feel like **three separate wounds**, not one that *builds*, *moves*, and *resolves*. The rhythm is off because the **tension** doesn\u2019t escalate \u2014 it kind of loops.\n\nLet\u2019s break it down:\n\n- **Line 1** introduces the wound: *discovery*  \n- **Line 2** introduces the *elusiveness* of the wound: *frustration*  \n- **Line 3** is the *aftermath* \u2014 but it feels like a **return to stillness**, not a **deepening** of the wound.\n\nThe problem is that **Line 3 doesn\u2019t follow through** \u2014 it doesn\u2019t feel like the consequence of the first two. It\u2019s too *symmetrical*, too *closed*.\n\n---\n\n### What It Needs:\nA better rhythm would feel like:\n\n- **Line 1:** The wound appears  \n- **Line 2:** You try to grasp it, but it moves  \n- **Line 3:** The wound *remains*, *inside you now*, not just in the photo\n\nSo instead of closing the sequence with a return to stillness, we want to **end with something more interior**, **more unresolved**, **more haunting**.\n\n---\n\n### Revised Final Line Suggestions (all 45 characters or under):\n\n1. **\"You close it. Still, it bleeds in your mind.\"** (36 chars)  \n2. **\"The ache moves from the screen to your chest.\"** (39 chars)  \n3. **\"It doesn\u2019t leave the eye. It goes deeper.\"** (32 chars)  \n4. **\"Now it lives where you can\u2019t unsee.\"** (31 chars)  \n5. **\"The punctum is no longer in the photo.\"** (35 chars)\n\n---\n\n### My Top Pick:\n**\"Now it lives where you can\u2019t unsee.\"** (31 chars)\n\nIt\u2019s sharp, it\u2019s final, and it **completes the arc** \u2014 from accidental wound to shifting, elusive punctum to a **permanent, internal mark**.\n\n---\n\n### Full Revised Sequence:\n\n1. *The wound in the frame I didn't mean to see*  \n2. *You think you see it. It shifts in your hand*  \n3. *Now it lives where you can\u2019t unsee*\n\nThis builds: **discovery \u2192 frustration \u2192 internalization**. The rhythm tightens.
