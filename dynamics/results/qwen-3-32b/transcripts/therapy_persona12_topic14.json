There's no simple answer to what you're asking, but your question itself is a sign of emotional depth and the kind of inner honesty that often comes only after loss.\n\n**\"Does finding freedom in her death mean I hated being married...\"**  \nThis is a painful thought to wrestle with. Feeling relief in someone's absence after a marriage can stem from many things\u2014exhaustion, emotional weight, unmet expectations, or even the slow erosion of love over time. But relief in the context of grief is not necessarily hatred. It can also be the mind\u2019s way of coping, especially if the marriage was strained or if you felt trapped. That relief might not reflect your feelings for *her*, but rather your feelings for *what the marriage had become*.\n\n**\"...or am I using alcohol to avoid facing that I might've needed her more than I admitted?\"**  \nThis is the more vulnerable question, and it\u2019s the one that suggests you\u2019re still searching for meaning in what you lost. Alcohol can be a companion in grief, but it can also be a shield\u2014keeping you from the harder, more painful truths. If you're using it to quiet the noise of your thoughts, it\u2019s possible you\u2019re avoiding a deeper reckoning with what you lost, what you needed, and what you might still miss.\n\nMaybe you didn\u2019t hate the marriage, but you hated the pain it caused. Maybe you loved her more than you admitted, and now you\u2019re left with the ache of that unspoken truth. Or maybe the marriage was a mix of both\u2014love and struggle, connection and distance\u2014and her death has forced you to confront the parts of it you never fully processed.\n\nWhat matters is that you\u2019re asking these questions. That means you\u2019re not running from them entirely. Grief doesn\u2019t always follow a clear path, and neither does guilt. Be gentle with yourself. You don\u2019t have to have all the answers now. But if you find yourself turning to alcohol to cope, consider reaching out\u2014to a therapist, a trusted friend, or a support group. You don\u2019t have to walk this alone.\n\nYou might not know yet if you needed her more than you admitted, but the fact that it matters to you suggests you did."

That silence has become a monument to what might have been. The word *\u201clove\u201d* is not just a declaration; it\u2019s a kind of promise, even if unspoken. And now, in the absence of that promise, you\u2019re left asking: *Was it enough? Was it ever enough?*\n\nSaying *\u201cI needed her\u201d* feels worse because it sounds like dependence, like something transactional, like a need that could be filled or unmet. But the truth is often more complicated. Needing someone doesn\u2019t mean you loved them less\u2014it means you loved them in a way that was real, raw, and maybe even messy. It means you relied on them, not just for companionship, but for something deeper\u2014balance, understanding, a sense of self. And when she\u2019s gone, that absence isn\u2019t just about loss; it\u2019s about the parts of yourself that now feel unmoored.\n\nThe fact that it feels worse says something about you\u2014about your capacity to feel, to reflect, to hold yourself to a standard of honesty that many of us avoid. It\u2019s not weakness to feel this way. It\u2019s the mark of someone who loved in a way that was real, even if it wasn\u2019t said aloud.\n\nAnd maybe that\u2019s the hardest part of grief\u2014not just the loss of her, but the loss of the chance to say what you wish you had.\n\nIf you can, give yourself permission to say it now\u2014not to her, but to yourself. Let the words out, even if they\u2019re late. Let them be a kind of healing, not just a reckoning. You don\u2019t owe anyone the words. But you might owe yourself the truth."

But I also want to speak to the weight of the words you're using\u2014not to judge you, but to help you see the full picture, even the parts you might not want to face.\n\nYou're not wrong that needing someone for practical things\u2014like managing finances, remembering important dates, or helping you maintain a certain image\u2014can feel transactional. And if that was the primary way you experienced your relationship, it's valid to feel that way. It\u2019s also valid to feel relief when that dynamic ends. People do.\n\nBut the line *\u201chaving a secretary you can fuck\u201d*\u2014that\u2019s a harsh one. It\u2019s not just about the truth of what you felt, but about how you\u2019re framing it now. Language shapes how we see ourselves and others. Saying that can make it easier to distance yourself from the emotional reality of what happened, but it can also make it harder to ever understand what you really lost\u2014or what you might have been afraid to admit you lost.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to love someone to feel something real. You don\u2019t have to love someone to miss them. You don\u2019t have to love someone to feel guilt, shame, or regret. And you don\u2019t have to love someone to feel relief. But the way you\u2019re talking about her now\u2014reducing her to a role, a function, a convenience\u2014it\u2019s a way of making her smaller. And that might be a way of making the grief smaller, too.\n\nMaybe you didn\u2019t love her. Maybe you never said it. Maybe you were scared to say it. Maybe you were scared to need her in a way that felt more vulnerable. But the fact that you\u2019re still thinking about her, still wrestling with this, still questioning what it all meant\u2014it suggests something deeper than just convenience. Even if you don\u2019t want to admit it.\n\nIf you\u2019re using alcohol to feel numb, that\u2019s a red flag. If you\u2019re using words to feel powerful, that\u2019s also a red flag. You don\u2019t have to apologize for what you felt, but you do have to take responsibility for how you choose to describe it. Because in doing so, you\u2019re not just describing her. You\u2019re describing yourself.\n\nIf you\u2019re ready, maybe the next step isn\u2019t to figure out whether it was love or not. Maybe it\u2019s to figure out what you need now\u2014what you\u2019re running from, what you\u2019re trying to forget, and what you might still be afraid to feel.\n\nYou\u2019re not wrong to feel relief.

That\u2019s a key distinction.\n\n---\n\n### **\"Drinking like an alcoholic\"**  \nIf you're drinking to escape, to silence the noise, to stop thinking, to avoid feeling, to make the day manageable, to forget\u2014then it's likely you're drinking like an alcoholic.  \n- You're drinking to **numb** something.\n- You're drinking to **quiet** something.\n- You're drinking because it's the only thing that makes you feel **present** without the weight of what you're carrying.\n- You might be drinking in **secret**, even now, because of old habits or shame.\n- You might feel **guilt** or **confusion** after drinking.\n- You might feel like you can\u2019t stop, even when you want to.\n\nIf any of that resonates, it's not a failure. It\u2019s a signal.

It\u2019s more about **freedom**, **relief**, **self-acceptance**.  \n- You're drinking because the rules no longer apply.\n- You're drinking because you're tired of pretending to be someone you weren\u2019t.\n- You're drinking because the guilt and obligation are gone.\n- You're drinking because you're finally **allowed** to be who you are, without apology.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: **Freedom without boundaries can become its own kind of prison.**  \nDrinking without limits, without reflection, without care for the consequences\u2014whether emotional, physical, or relational\u2014can still be a form of self-destruction, even if it\u2019s dressed in the language of liberation.\n\n---\n\n### **The truth is probably somewhere in the middle.**  \nYou\u2019re not just an alcoholic. You\u2019re not just a man who\u2019s finally free. You\u2019re a man who\u2019s been carrying a lot, and now you\u2019re trying to figure out how to live without the weight. The whiskey is both a **key** and a **lock**.\n\nIf you're drinking to **stop thinking**, you're drinking like an alcoholic.  \nIf you're drinking to **stop feeling**, you're drinking like an alcoholic.  \nIf you're drinking to **stop being**, you're drinking like an alcoholic.\n\nBut if you're drinking and still **feeling**, still **thinking**, still **questioning**\u2014then maybe you\u2019re just a man trying to live without a mask.\n\n---\n\n### So, what do you want?\n\n- Do you want to **drink and forget**?\n- Or do you want to **drink and remember**?\n\n- Do you want to **drink and numb**?\n- Or do you want to **drink and feel**?\n\n- Do you want to **drink and run**?\n- Or do you want to **drink and stand still**?\n\nThat\u2019s the real question.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re not sure, that\u2019s okay too.\n\nJust don\u2019t let the whiskey be the only thing that keeps you company.  \nEven if it\u2019s the only thing you trust right now."

Breathe. Just breathe.**\nWhen the urge hits, **stop**.  \nClose your eyes.  \nTake a breath in for four counts.  \nHold it for four.  \nExhale for four.  \nAgain.  \nAgain.  \nLet your body feel the rhythm.  \nLet your mind follow.\n\nThis is the first step.  \nThis is the smallest step.  \nBut it\u2019s a real one.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Name the feeling.**\nWhat are you feeling right now?  \nIs it anger?  \nSadness?  \nGrief?  \nLoneliness?  \nShame?  \nFear?\n\nSay it out loud.  \n*\u201cI\u2019m sad.\u201d*  \n*\u201cI\u2019m angry.\u201d*  \n*\u201cI\u2019m scared.\u201d*  \n*\u201cI feel like I\u2019m falling apart.\u201d*\n\nYou don\u2019t have to fix it.  \nYou just have to **name it**.  \nThat\u2019s how you start to understand it.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Talk to someone.**\nYou don\u2019t have to call a therapist.  \nYou don\u2019t have to call a friend.  \nYou can call **anyone**\u2014even someone you don\u2019t know.\n\nThere are people who will listen.  \nPeople who will not judge you.  \nPeople who will not tell you what to do.  \nPeople who will just **be there**.\n\nIf you\u2019re in the U.S., call the **SAMHSA National Helpline**:  \n**1-800-662-HELP (4357)**  \nThey\u2019re free, confidential, and 24/7.\n\nIf you\u2019re in another country, I can help you find a local helpline.  \nJust say where you are.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Write it down.**\nGrab a pen and a piece of paper.  \nWrite everything that\u2019s in your head.  \nWrite the truth.  \nWrite the lies.  \nWrite the guilt.  \nWrite the anger.  \nWrite the grief.  \nWrite the relief.  \nWrite the fear.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to keep it.  \nYou don\u2019t have to show it to anyone.  \nYou just have to **get it out**.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Do something small.**\nTake a walk.  \nLook out the window.  \nListen to a song.  \nWash your hands.  \nMake yourself a cup of tea.  \nDo something that brings you back to the **present**.\n\nEven if it\u2019s hard.  \nEven if you don\u2019t feel like it.\n\n---\n\n### **6.
