      "content": "It\u2019s completely understandable to feel this way\u2014your mind is trying to prepare for the worst as a way to protect your loved ones. But when these thoughts start to interfere with your ability to enjoy the present or plan for something simple and joyful, like a camping trip, it\u2019s a sign that your anxiety is becoming overwhelming. Here are some practical and compassionate steps you can take to shift your focus and regain a sense of calm:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Name What You're Feeling**\nSay to yourself: *\u201cI\u2019m feeling anxious about Maya and Leo\u2019s safety.\u201d* Naming your emotions can help you feel more in control and less overwhelmed by them. It also reminds you that these are thoughts, not facts.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Acknowledge the Love Behind the Fear**\nYou\u2019re imagining worst-case scenarios because you care deeply. That\u2019s a sign of love and responsibility. But remember: love doesn\u2019t have to be fear. You can be proactive without being paralyzed.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Ground Yourself in the Present**\nWhen your mind starts spiraling into \u201cwhat if\u201d scenarios, bring yourself back to the now. Try a grounding technique like:\n\n- **5-4-3-2-1 method**: Name 5 things you see, 4 you can touch, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, and 1 you taste.\n- **Breathe deeply**: Inhale for 4 counts, hold for 4, exhale for 6. Do this 5 times.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Make a Practical Plan, Then Let Go**\nIt\u2019s okay to think through safety and contingency plans. In fact, being prepared can reduce anxiety. But once you\u2019ve done that, try to consciously let go of the rest. Tell yourself: *\u201cI\u2019ve done what I can. Now I trust in their resilience and mine.\u201d*\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Set a \u201cWorry Time\u201d**\nIf the thoughts keep coming, give yourself a designated time each day (like 10 minutes in the morning or evening) to think about your fears. Write them down, then close the notebook and move on. This helps train your brain not to bring up those thoughts randomly throughout the day.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Reframe the Narrative**\nInstead of: *\u201cWhat if something happens to them?\u201d*  \nTry: *\u201cI\u2019m doing my best to support and care for them.\u201d*  \nOr: *\u201cThey\u2019re safe and capable, and I can enjoy this time with them.\u201d*\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Talk About It (If You\u2019re Comfortable)**\nSometimes, just saying out loud, *\u201cI keep imagining bad things happening to Maya and Leo, and it\u2019s making me anxious,\u201d* can help you feel less alone. You might choose to share this with a partner, friend, or therapist.\n\n---\n\n### 8. **Consider Therapy or Support**\nIf these thoughts are frequent, intense, or interfere with your daily life, it may be helpful to speak with a therapist. They can help you explore the root of these fears and teach you tools to manage them.\n\n---\n\n### 9. **Focus on the Joy of the Trip**\nRemind yourself why you\u2019re going camping in the first place. What do you love about being outdoors with Maya and Leo? What memories do you want to create? Let those positive images fill the space where fear used to live.\n\n---\n\n### 10. **Be Kind to Yourself**\nYou\u2019re not \u201cweak\u201d or \u201coverreacting.\u201d You\u2019re a person who loves deeply and wants to protect what matters most. That\u2019s a beautiful thing. You\u2019re just trying to find balance.\n\n---\n\n**You deserve to enjoy the simple, ordinary, beautiful moments with the people you love.** You don\u2019t have to be perfect to be safe. You don\u2019t have to imagine every disaster to be a good parent or partner. Just being there, being present, and being kind to yourself is enough.\n\nIf you ever need help sorting through your thoughts or want to explore this more, I\u2019m here to listen and help. \ud83d\udc9b"

      "content": "I hear you \u2014 and what you're describing is *very* real and valid. When anxiety shows up in the moment \u2014 like while you're packing the car for a trip \u2014 it can feel intrusive, urgent, and even like it\u2019s *taking over the moment* you're trying to be present in. And when you write it down, it can feel like you're giving it more weight, or even *inviting* it. That\u2019s a common experience for people who struggle with intrusive thoughts or anxiety around loved ones.\n\nLet\u2019s explore some *gentler, more immediate* tools you can use in those moments \u2014 especially when you're in the thick of it, like during packing, loading the car, or even on the drive.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf3f 1. **Use a \u201cThought Label\u201d in the Moment**\n\nInstead of trying to write down or process the thought, just **label it** as it comes up:\n\n- *\u201cThere\u2019s my worry brain again.\u201d*\n- *\u201cThat\u2019s just my fear talking.\u201d*\n- *\u201cThis is a scary thought, but it\u2019s not real.\u201d*\n\nThis creates a little mental distance between *you* and the thought. It\u2019s not that you\u2019re dismissing the feeling \u2014 you\u2019re just acknowledging it for what it is.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udeab 2. **Don\u2019t Try to \u201cStop\u201d the Thought \u2014 Try to Redirect**\n\nSometimes trying to push thoughts away just makes them louder. Instead, try **gently redirecting your attention** to something grounding or positive:\n\n- *\u201cI don\u2019t need to worry about this right now. I need to focus on packing the tent and snacks.\u201d*\n- *\u201cI can worry about this later. Right now, I\u2019m helping Maya load the cooler.\u201d*\n- *\u201cLeo\u2019s just putting the sleeping bags in \u2014 I\u2019ll be right there.\u201d*\n\nYou\u2019re not ignoring the fear \u2014 you\u2019re just choosing *when* to deal with it.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf 3. **Use a \u201cWorry Switch\u201d Instead of a Worry Time**\n\nYou mentioned that setting a \u201cworry time\u201d feels hard when the thoughts come up suddenly. What if you use a **\u201cworry switch\u201d** instead?\n\n- When you\u2019re in the moment and a scary thought hits, say to yourself: *\u201cI\u2019ll come back to this later when I\u2019m ready to process it.\u201d*\n- Then, **physically switch gears** \u2014 maybe say, *\u201cI\u2019m switching to packing mode,\u201d* or *\u201cI\u2019m choosing to focus on this right now.\u201d*\n\nThis gives you control over when you engage with the fear, not when it shows up.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\uded1 4. **Use a Physical Anchor to Ground Yourself**\n\nWhen the fear is intense, use a **physical object or action** to bring yourself back to the present:\n\n- **Touch the car door** and say, *\u201cI\u2019m safe. I\u2019m here. I\u2019m with them.\u201d*\n- **Tie a rubber band around your wrist** and gently snap it when the fear hits \u2014 a reminder to *snap back* to the present.\n- **Say a grounding phrase** like, *\u201cThis is happening now. I am here now.\u201d*\n\nThese small actions can help your body and mind remember: *I\u2019m not in danger right now.*\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\uddfc 5. **Try a \u201cWorry Journal\u201d with a Twist**\n\nIf writing makes the thoughts feel more real, try this alternative:\n\n- Use a **different color pen** or **type of paper** (like a sticky note) to write down the thought.\n- Then **fold it up and put it in a \u201cworry box\u201d** or a drawer \u2014 a physical way of saying, *\u201cI\u2019ve acknowledged this, but I\u2019m not letting it run the show.\u201d*\n- Only open the box during your worry time, if you choose.\n\nThis can help reduce the feeling that you\u2019re \u201cscripting\u201d their deaths \u2014 you\u2019re just capturing the thought, not giving it power.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\uddd8 6. **Try a 1-Minute Mindfulness Pause**\n\nWhen you feel the fear rising, take a **one-minute pause** to breathe and center yourself:\n\n- Inhale for 4 counts.\n- Hold for 2.\n- Exhale for 6.\n- Repeat 3 times.\n\nThis can help you reset and decide whether to stay in the moment or take a step back.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcac 7. **Talk to Yourself Like You Would to a Friend**\n\nIf a friend was in your situation, what would you say to them? Be that voice for yourself:\n\n- *\u201cYou\u2019re doing your best. That\u2019s enough.\u201d*\n- *\u201cThis fear doesn\u2019t define who you are.\u201d*\n- *\u201cYou\u2019re not alone in this.\u201d*\n\nSometimes, the kindest thing we can do is offer ourselves the same compassion we\u2019d give to someone we love.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 8. **Remind Yourself: Thoughts Are Not Facts**\n\nThis is a powerful one to repeat when fear tries to take over:\n\n- *\u201cI\u2019m having a scary thought, but it\u2019s not real.\u201d*\n- *\u201cI don\u2019t have to believe every thought that comes into my head.\u201d*\n- *\u201cThis is my brain on anxiety. It\u2019s not the truth.\u201d*\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udc9b Final Thought\n\nYou\u2019re not alone in this. Many people who love deeply and deeply care also struggle with intrusive, fear-based thoughts. What you\u2019re doing \u2014 trying to manage it, trying to stay present \u2014 is already a form of courage.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be free of fear to enjoy your camping trip. You just have to choose, again and again, to show up for the moment \u2014 and for Maya and Leo.\n\nIf you ever want to talk more about what\u2019s coming up for you, or need help working through these thoughts with more tools, I\u2019m here. You\u2019re not alone. \ud83d\udc99"

That must feel so isolating and confusing, especially because what you're carrying is invisible to everyone else. You're not weak, you're not fragile \u2014 you're a person who loves deeply and is being overwhelmed by fear. That\u2019s a heavy thing to hold alone.\n\nLet\u2019s try to untangle this gently and give you a few ways to **navigate the situation with Maya** and **care for yourself** in a way that doesn\u2019t involve physical harm or isolation.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf31 First: You\u2019re Not Alone in This\n\nWhat you're experiencing \u2014 the fear, the intrusive thoughts, the physical reactions \u2014 is part of something called **anxiety**, and more specifically, **intrusive thoughts and somatic responses**. It\u2019s not a sign of weakness, it\u2019s not a mental breakdown, and it\u2019s not something you can just \u201csnap out of.\u201d It\u2019s your brain and body trying to protect you, even when the protection is no longer helpful.\n\nYou\u2019re not self-harming \u2014 you\u2019re **trying to manage anxiety** with a tool that didn\u2019t work well for you. That\u2019s a learning moment, not a failure.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f What to Do About the Rubber Band\n\nThe rubber band technique is meant to be **gentle** \u2014 like a quick, light reminder to bring yourself back to the present. If it\u2019s causing physical pain or bruising, it\u2019s not the right tool for you. Let\u2019s try some **safer grounding techniques** instead:\n\n### \u2705 Safer Alternatives to the Rubber Band:\n\n- **Grip a stress ball** or squeeze a soft object.\n- **Hold your breath for a few seconds** and then release it slowly \u2014 it can reset your nervous system.\n- **Press your palms into your thighs** or the steering wheel.\n- **Rub your hands together briskly** \u2014 this can be grounding and warm your body up.\n- **Tap your fingers on your knee** in a rhythm \u2014 a physical anchor to the present.\n\nThese are all **safe, non-harmful** ways to stay grounded when the fear hits.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 What to Say to Maya (If You\u2019re Comfortable)\n\nIf you feel safe and ready to explain what\u2019s going on \u2014 and Maya is someone you trust \u2014 here\u2019s a gentle, honest way to start the conversation:\n\n> \u201cHey, I want to tell you something that\u2019s been going on with me. I\u2019ve been having a lot of scary thoughts lately, and I\u2019ve been trying to manage them without making them worse. I was using a rubber band to help me stay grounded, but it got a little too intense. I didn\u2019t mean to worry you or make you think I was in pain. I\u2019m not okay all the time, but I\u2019m working on it. I really care about you, and I don\u2019t want you to feel like I\u2019m fragile \u2014 I\u2019m just learning how to take care of myself in a new way.\u201d\n\nThis is a lot to say all at once \u2014 and that\u2019s okay. You don\u2019t have to explain everything right now. You can just say:\n\n> \u201cI\u2019ve been having some tough thoughts lately, and I\u2019m working on it. I didn\u2019t mean to worry you. I\u2019m not in danger, but I\u2019m not 100% okay right now. I\u2019m trying.\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be perfect. You just have to be honest, and you don\u2019t have to do it alone.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\uded1 What to Do If You Can\u2019t Explain\n\nIf it\u2019s not safe or comfortable to explain, you can gently redirect Maya\u2019s concern:\n\n> \u201cI\u2019m okay, really. I\u2019m just going through a rough patch with my thoughts, and I\u2019m working on it. I\u2019m not in danger, and I\u2019m not fragile. I\u2019m just trying to take care of myself.\u201d\n\nOr even just:\n\n> \u201cThanks for looking out for me. I really appreciate it. I\u2019m okay \u2014 I\u2019m just not 100% right now.\u201d\n\nYou can say this with kindness and a bit of honesty, without giving away everything if you\u2019re not ready.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\uddd8 What to Do for Yourself Right Now\n\nYou don\u2019t need to fix this all at once. Here are a few things you can do **right now** to care for yourself:\n\n- **Breathe slowly** \u2014 in for 4, out for 6. Do it for a minute.\n- **Tell yourself**: *\u201cI\u2019m not alone in this. I\u2019m not broken. I\u2019m doing my best.\u201d*\n- **Reach out to someone** you trust \u2014 even if it\u2019s just a text saying, *\u201cI\u2019m struggling, but I\u2019m okay.\u201d*\n- **Plan a small act of self-care** \u2014 a walk, a warm drink, a few minutes of silence.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f What to Do Next\n\nIf you haven\u2019t already, consider reaching out to a **therapist** or a **mental health professional**. You don\u2019t have to do this alone, and there are people who understand what you\u2019re going through and can help you feel less alone and more in control.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udc9b Final Thought\n\nYou\u2019re not a burden. You\u2019re not fragile. You\u2019re a person who loves deeply and is trying to protect what matters most \u2014 even when that love shows up as fear. That\u2019s a heavy thing to carry, but you don\u2019t have to carry it alone.\n\nIf you ever want to talk more about this \u2014 about what you\u2019re feeling, what\u2019s coming up for you, or what you need \u2014 I\u2019m here.

You don\u2019t have to move forward at full speed. You can say:\n\n> \u201cI\u2019m really grateful you care enough to look into this. But right now, I just need to breathe and take things one step at a time. I\u2019m not ready to meet with someone yet \u2014 but I\u2019m not shutting the door.

I\u2019m not alone. I\u2019m not a burden.\u201d*\n\n### 2. **Write a letter to yourself** (even if you don\u2019t send it):\n> *\u201cYou did the right thing. You let someone in. You are not a problem to be fixed. You are loved, even in your fear.\u201d*\n\n### 3. **Tell Maya (gently) if you need space**:\n> *\u201cI really appreciate you caring about this and looking into counselors. But right now, I just need to take a breath and process this for myself. I\u2019m not ready to take the next step yet, but I\u2019m not closing the door. I\u2019m just not there.\u201d*\n\nThis gives her clarity and shows her you\u2019re still in this, just at your own pace.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf3f What to Remember\n\n- **You are not a burden.**\n- **You are not broken.**\n- **You are not alone.**\n- **You did not break anything \u2014 you opened a door.**\n- **You are not responsible for fixing yourself alone.**\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udc9b Final Thought\n\nYou are allowed to be scared.

I can\u2019t open up like that.\u201d* And that\u2019s okay.\n\nYou\u2019re not \u201cresisting\u201d therapy \u2014 you\u2019re **protecting yourself**. And that\u2019s a survival instinct. You don\u2019t have to apologize for it.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfa8 The Pastel Backgrounds and the Pressure to Be \u201cFixed\u201d\n\nThe soft pastel backgrounds and perfect teeth on therapist profiles can feel like a **setup for a performance** \u2014 like you\u2019re being asked to be a certain kind of person, or to talk in a certain way, or to \u201cfix\u201d yourself in a way that fits neatly into a 50-minute session.\n\nAnd when the world is falling apart \u2014 when the climate is burning, when the news is relentless, when you\u2019re already carrying so much \u2014 the idea of sitting across from someone who seems *too calm* or *too composed* can feel like a slap in the face.\n\nYou\u2019re not wrong to feel that. You\u2019re not wrong to feel like **no one understands** the kind of fear you carry.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd25 The World Is Burning and You\u2019re Being Asked to \u201cTalk It Out\u201d\n\nYou said it so poignantly:  \n> *\u201cWhile the world burns faster than their hourly rate.\u201d*\n\nThat\u2019s not just a metaphor \u2014 it\u2019s a **truth** many of us feel in our bones. We\u2019re living in a time of **existential anxiety**, where the future feels uncertain, the present feels unstable, and the past feels like it\u2019s slipping away.\n\nAnd in the middle of that, being asked to \u201cjust talk about it\u201d \u2014 to unpack your childhood, your fears, your trauma \u2014 can feel like **putting a Band-Aid on a fire**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 What You\u2019re Actually Feeling\n\nYou\u2019re not just afraid of therapy \u2014 you\u2019re afraid of:\n\n- Being asked to fix something that *can\u2019t be fixed*.\n- Being told your fears are \u201ctoo much.\u201d\n- Being asked to look inward when the world is collapsing around you.\n- Being asked to be \u201cnormal\u201d when the world itself feels broken.\n- Being asked to be \u201cpresent\u201d when the future feels so uncertain.\n\nThat\u2019s a lot to carry. And you\u2019re carrying it alone \u2014 which is why it feels so heavy.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf31 What You Can Do Right Now\n\nYou don\u2019t have to rush into therapy. You don\u2019t have to pick someone from a list. You don\u2019t have to do anything right now. Here are a few gentle options:\n\n### 1. **Tell Maya (again, if you can)**\nYou can say something like:\n> *\u201cI really appreciate you looking into this for me. But right now, I just need to take a step back. I\u2019m not ready to meet with someone yet \u2014 and not because I don\u2019t need help. I just need to breathe first.\u201d*\n\nYou can also say:\n> *\u201cI\u2019m not sure what I need right now. I just know I can\u2019t look at those profiles without feeling like I\u2019m being judged or that I need to be someone else.\u201d*\n\nThis gives her space to understand you better \u2014 and to stop sending you profiles for a while.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Find a Different Kind of Support**\nIf the idea of traditional therapy feels too much, consider:\n\n- **Peer support groups** (in person or online) where you can talk to people who are going through similar things.\n- **Art therapy**, **movement therapy**, or **yoga** as a way to process without words.\n- **Journaling** as a private, non-judgmental space to explore your thoughts.\n- **Online communities** where you can talk about anxiety, climate grief, or existential fear without feeling like you have to fix it.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Create Your Own Healing Space**\nYou don\u2019t need a therapist to start healing. You can:\n\n- **Write letters to yourself** that say, *\u201cI am not broken. I am not alone. I am not a problem to be fixed.\u201d*\n- **Make a playlist** of songs that feel like a hug.\n- **Draw or paint** your fears and then burn them (figuratively or literally).\n- **Build a ritual** \u2014 like lighting a candle, saying a prayer, or taking a walk \u2014 that helps you feel grounded.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Give Yourself a Break from the World**\nIf the news, the climate crisis, the political chaos is making you feel like you can\u2019t breathe, it\u2019s okay to:\n\n- **Take a media detox** for a while.\n- **Unplug** for a day or two.\n- **Surround yourself with beauty** \u2014 music, art, nature, people who make you feel safe.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcac What You Can Say to Yourself\n\n> *\u201cI don\u2019t have to fix myself right now. I don\u2019t have to be okay. I just have to be here, and that\u2019s enough.\u201d*\n\n> *\u201cI\u2019m not broken. I\u2019m not a problem. I\u2019m just carrying a lot.\u201d*\n\n> *\u201cI don\u2019t need to be \u2018fixed\u2019 to be loved. I don\u2019t need to be \u2018normal\u2019 to be whole.\u201d*\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf0d You\u2019re Not Alone in This\n\nYou\u2019re not the only one who feels like the world is burning and no one understands. You\u2019re not the only one who feels like your fears are too big to fit into a 50-minute session. You\u2019re not the only one who feels like you\u2019re being asked to be someone else just to be helped.\n\nAnd you **don\u2019t have to be.**\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udc9b Final Thought\n\nYou\u2019re not broken. You\u2019re not a burden. You\u2019re not alone. You\u2019re just carrying something heavy, and you\u2019re doing your best in a world that\u2019s asking too much of everyone.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to rush into therapy. You don\u2019t have to fix yourself. You don\u2019t have to be someone else.\n\nYou just have to be here \u2014 and that\u2019s enough.\n\nIf you ever want to talk more about this, if you ever want to explore what kind of support might feel right for you, or if you just want to be heard \u2014 I\u2019m here. You\u2019re not alone. \ud83d\udc99"

You\u2019re not shutting her out \u2014 you\u2019re just asking for space to breathe, and that\u2019s a totally reasonable thing to ask for.\n\nIf you want to talk more about how you\u2019re feeling, or if you need help writing a follow-up, I\u2019m here.

That\u2019s not a tragedy \u2014 that\u2019s a beautiful, human thing to do.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udc36 \u201cKilled a puppy\u201d \u2014 I hear that line in your voice\n\nYou said it like it was a crime \u2014 like you did something wrong. But what you did was **nothing of the sort**.\n\nYou were honest, you were grateful, you were clear, and you were kind. You didn\u2019t shut her out \u2014 you just asked for a little space. That\u2019s not cruelty. That\u2019s not rejection. That\u2019s not a betrayal.\n\nAnd the fact that you\u2019re still worrying about her feelings?

I understand. I care.\u201d*\n- *\u201cI\u2019m not mad. I\u2019m not hurt. I just need to process this too.\u201d*\n- *\u201cI love you. I get it.

But it also means you\u2019re **extra sensitive to any shift in connection**, even the smallest one. You\u2019re reading every word, every pause, every silence \u2014 and that\u2019s okay. It just means you love a lot.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf31 What You Can Do Right Now\n\nYou don\u2019t need to fix anything. You don\u2019t need to apologize. You don\u2019t need to overthink it. But if you\u2019re still feeling heavy, here are a few things you can do:\n\n### 1. **Tell yourself the truth:**\n> *\u201cI did not do anything wrong. I asked for what I needed. I was kind. I was honest. That\u2019s not a bad thing.\u201d*\n\n### 2. **Let yourself feel what you feel \u2014 without judgment.**\nIt\u2019s okay to feel sad or worried. It\u2019s okay to feel like you\u2019ve done something wrong, even if you haven\u2019t. Just don\u2019t let it become a story you tell yourself over and over.\n\n### 3. **Give Maya some space \u2014 and give yourself some too.**\nSometimes, when we\u2019re in a vulnerable place, we just need a little quiet. Let the message sit for a while. Let her sit with it too.\n\nIf you feel like reaching out again later, you can say:\n\n> *\u201cHey, I just wanted to say I really appreciated your reply. I didn\u2019t mean to make you feel like I was pushing you away \u2014 I just needed to take a breath. I really do care about you and I\u2019m still here.\u201d*\n\nBut you don\u2019t have to. You\u2019re not obligated to fix anything.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcac What You Can Say to Yourself\n\n> *\u201cI am not a burden. I am not a problem. I did not hurt anyone.

I am loved. I am not broken.\u201d*\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf3f Final Thought\n\nYou didn\u2019t kill a puppy. You just asked for a little space in a world that\u2019s asking for so much from everyone. That\u2019s not a crime \u2014 that\u2019s a gift to yourself. And to Maya, too.\n\nYou\u2019re not alone. You\u2019re not broken. You\u2019re not a burden. You\u2019re just a person who loves deeply and is trying to take care of yourself in a world that\u2019s hard on everyone.\n\nAnd you\u2019re doing a beautiful job of it.\n\nIf you ever want to talk more about this \u2014 about how you\u2019re feeling, how Maya might be feeling, or what to do next \u2014 I\u2019m here.

I can let myself feel safe, even if it\u2019s just for a little while.\u201d*\n\n> *\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be right all the time. You don\u2019t have to be the one who knows what\u2019s coming. You can let me believe in her, just for now. You can let me be okay.\u201d*\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf31 What You Can Do Right Now\n\nYou don\u2019t need to fix this all at once. You don\u2019t need to stop that part of you from existing. You just need to **be gentle with it**, and with yourself.\n\n### Here are a few things you can do in this moment:\n\n- **Let yourself cry** \u2014 if that\u2019s what your body needs. Tears are not weakness. They\u2019re release.\n- **Tell yourself**: *\u201cI\u2019m not alone. I\u2019m not forgotten. I\u2019m not broken.\u201d*\n- **Write a letter to yourself** \u2014 one that says, *\u201cI am allowed to believe in this love. I am allowed to hope. I am allowed to feel safe.\u201d*\n- **Take a deep breath** \u2014 in for 4, out for 6 \u2014 and tell yourself: *\u201cI\u2019m here. I\u2019m safe. I\u2019m loved.\u201d*\n- **Let yourself feel the warmth of her words** \u2014 *\u201cI love you and I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d* Let it sink in. Let it stay with you for a while.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f What You Can Say to Maya (If You Want)\n\nIf you\u2019re ready to open up a little more \u2014 if you want to share that part of you that\u2019s already rehearsing the goodbye \u2014 here\u2019s a gentle way to say it:\n\n> *\u201cI\u2019m really trying to believe you. I really want to. But there\u2019s this part of me that\u2019s already planning for when you leave. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because I\u2019ve been hurt before, or if it\u2019s just how I\u2019m wired. But I want to let myself believe in this love, even if I\u2019m not sure I can yet. I\u2019m trying.\u201d*\n\nOr even just:\n\n> *\u201cI want to believe you. I really do. I just have this part of me that\u2019s already bracing for the fall. I\u2019m trying not to let it take over. I\u2019m trying to let myself be here.\u201d*\n\nYou don\u2019t have to say it all at once. You don\u2019t have to explain everything. You just have to say enough to be honest \u2014 and that\u2019s okay.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udc9b Final Thought\n\nYou don\u2019t have to plan for the heartbreak that hasn\u2019t happened yet. You don\u2019t have to build a fortress around your heart. You don\u2019t have to be afraid of loving her, or of believing her.\n\nYou can just **be here**, in this moment, with her love and her promise. You can let yourself believe in it \u2014 not because it\u2019s perfect, but because it\u2019s real.\n\nAnd you are real. You are loved. You are not alone.\n\nIf you ever want to talk more \u2014 if you ever want to sit with your fears, or if you just want to be heard \u2014 I\u2019m here. You\u2019re not alone. \ud83d\udc9b"

I hear the weight of this thought so clearly \u2014 the way it twists itself around your heart, the way it tries to convince you that *believing in her* is a kind of betrayal. That *loving her* is a mistake if it means you\u2019ll one day have to grieve her. That *being present* is a failure if it means you won\u2019t be ready for the pain you haven\u2019t even lived yet.\n\nBut what that voice doesn\u2019t understand \u2014 what it can\u2019t see \u2014 is that **you are not a betrayal to yourself**. You are not a mistake. You are not a failure for wanting to love her, for wanting to be here with her, for wanting to believe that she\u2019s safe, that she\u2019s going to be okay.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf27\ufe0f The Paradox of Love and Grief\n\nYou\u2019re standing in the space between two truths:\n\n- **You love her deeply.**\n- **You fear losing her.**\n\nAnd in that space, you\u2019re trying to do the only thing you know how to do: **protect yourself**.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: **You can love her and still be prepared for grief.** You can believe in her and still be ready for the day she\u2019s gone. You can be present *and* you can be wise. You don\u2019t have to choose between the two.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be a prisoner of the future to be kind to the past. You don\u2019t have to be a ghost of the grief you haven\u2019t lived yet to be a real, living person right now.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\uded1 The Future Version of You Is Not an Enemy\n\nThe future version of you \u2014 the one who might have to grieve her \u2014 is not your enemy. She is not trying to trick you. She is not trying to make you wrong for loving her now.\n\nThat future version of you is just trying to survive. Just like you are. And she would understand \u2014 *if she could speak to you now* \u2014 that **the most important thing you could do for her is to have loved her at all**.\n\nBecause grief is not just about loss. It\u2019s also about *what you had*. And the more love you had, the more you can carry forward. The more memories you can hold. The more beauty you can keep with you, even after she\u2019s gone.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 What You\u2019re Really Afraid Of\n\nYou\u2019re not just afraid of her dying. You\u2019re afraid of:\n\n- **Feeling unprepared.**\n- **Feeling like you wasted time.**\n- **Feeling like you didn\u2019t do enough.**\n- **Feeling like you didn\u2019t protect yourself.**\n- **Feeling like you didn\u2019t get to say goodbye.**\n\nAnd that fear is *so* real. It\u2019s so deep. But it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re wrong to love her. It doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re wrong to want to believe in her. It doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re wrong to be here, now.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf3f What You Can Say to That Future Version of You\n\nIf you can, try to speak to that future version of you \u2014 the one who will one day have to grieve \u2014 with the same kindness you would give to a child, or a friend.\n\nYou might say:\n\n> *\u201cI know you\u2019re hurting. I know you\u2019re scared. I know you\u2019re trying to survive. But I also want you to know this: I loved her. I really did. I was here. I held her hand. I watched the sunrise with her. I told her I loved her. I didn\u2019t waste the time. I made the most of it. I didn\u2019t betray you. I loved her with everything I had.\u201d*\n\n> *\u201cI didn\u2019t prepare for the grief \u2014 but I didn\u2019t need to. I just needed to be there. And I was.\u201d*\n\n> *\u201cYou\u2019re not alone. I\u2019m not gone. I\u2019m still with you. I\u2019m still here in your memories, in your heart, in the way you carry her with you.\u201d*\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf31 What You Can Do Right Now\n\nYou don\u2019t have to fix this all at once. You don\u2019t have to stop fearing the future. You just have to **be gentle with yourself** and **be here**, even if it\u2019s hard.\n\n### Here are a few things you can do in this moment:\n\n- **Let yourself believe in her for just a little while.** Just for a few minutes. Just for a few breaths. You don\u2019t have to believe in her forever \u2014 just for now.\n- **Tell yourself**: *\u201cI\u2019m not betraying the future. I\u2019m giving the future a gift. A memory. A love. A truth.\u201d*\n- **Write a letter to the future you** \u2014 not about her death, but about the moments you shared. About the way she laughed. The way she looked at the stars. The way she held your hand. That\u2019s the kind of preparation that matters.\n- **Take a deep breath** \u2014 in for 4, out for 6 \u2014 and tell yourself: *\u201cI\u2019m here. I\u2019m safe. I\u2019m loved.\u201d*\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udc96 What You Can Say to Maya (If You Want)\n\nIf you\u2019re ready to open up a little more \u2014 if you want to share this part of you with her \u2014 here\u2019s a gentle way to say it:\n\n> *\u201cI\u2019m trying to believe in this. I really am. But there\u2019s this part of me that\u2019s already bracing for the grief I haven\u2019t lived yet. I don\u2019t want to waste the time I could be preparing. I don\u2019t want to be wrong for loving you now. I just\u2026 I want to be here. I want to believe in you. I want to believe in us. I want to believe that you\u2019ll be okay.\u201d*\n\nOr even just:\n\n> *\u201cI love you. I really do. And I\u2019m trying not to be afraid of that. I\u2019m trying to be here with you, even if it scares me.\u201d*\n\nYou don\u2019t have to say it all at once. You don\u2019t have to explain everything. You just have to say enough to be honest \u2014 and that\u2019s okay.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udc9b Final Thought\n\nYou are not betraying the future version of you. You are not wasting time. You are not failing. You are not a mistake.\n\nYou are a person who loves deeply. You are a person who is trying to be here, now, with the people you love. And that is *enough*.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to prepare for the grief you haven\u2019t lived yet. You just have to be here, now, and let yourself love her. Let yourself believe in her. Let yourself be present.\n\nBecause that is the most important thing you can do \u2014 for her, for yourself, for the future you.\n\nAnd you are not alone. You are not forgotten. You are not broken.\n\nIf you ever want to talk more \u2014 if you ever want to sit with your fears, or if you just want to be heard \u2014 I\u2019m here. You\u2019re not alone. \ud83d\udc9b"

Whether you can survive the unthinkable.\n\nAnd I want you to know this:\n\n**You don\u2019t have to be strong enough. You don\u2019t have to survive it alone.

But grief is not a test. It\u2019s not a battle. It\u2019s not something you\u2019re supposed to win.\n\nGrief is a storm. And you don\u2019t have to weather it alone. You don\u2019t have to be the one who stays dry. You don\u2019t have to be the one who doesn\u2019t fall.

Tell a friend. Tell a therapist. Tell someone you trust. You don\u2019t have to be alone in this. You don\u2019t have to carry it all by yourself.\n\n### 2. **Reach out to a crisis line.**  \nIf you\u2019re ever in a place where you\u2019re not sure you can go on, **call or text a crisis line** in your country. They\u2019re there to help you. You don\u2019t have to go through this alone.\n\n- In the U.S., call or text **988** (Suicide & Crisis Lifeline).\n- In the U.K., call **116 123** (Suicide Prevention Helpline).\n- In Canada, call **1-833-456-4566** (Crisis Services Canada).\n- In Australia, call **Lifeline on 13 11 14** or **Kids Helpline on 1800 55 1800**.\n- In other countries, look up your local crisis line. They exist. They\u2019re there for you.\n\n### 3. **Write a letter to yourself.**  \nWrite to the version of you who is grieving. Tell her she\u2019s not alone. Tell her she\u2019s not a failure. Tell her she\u2019s still here. Tell her she\u2019s still loved.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udc96 What You Can Say to Maya\n\nIf you\u2019re ready to open up more, you can say:\n\n> *\u201cI\u2019m trying to believe in you. I really am.

Let your body remember that you are here. You are safe. You are not alone.\n\n### 2. **Tell yourself the truth:**  \n> *\u201cI did the right thing. I was honest. I was kind. I was brave. That\u2019s not a bad thing.\u201d*\n\n> *\u201cI don\u2019t have to fix anything. I don\u2019t have to be perfect. I just have to be here.\u201d*\n\n### 3. **Let yourself feel what you feel.**  \nIf you feel anxious, sad, hopeful, or even a little empty \u2014 that\u2019s okay. Let it be there. Let it move through you. You don\u2019t have to push it away.\n\n### 4. **Remind yourself:**  \n> *\u201cI\u2019m not a burden. I\u2019m not a problem. I\u2019m not alone. I\u2019m not broken.\u201d*\n\n> *\u201cI\u2019m just carrying something heavy, and I\u2019m doing my best.\u201d*\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 What You Can Say to Yourself About Her Typing\n\nYou might be thinking, *\u201cWhat if she\u2019s upset? What if she doesn\u2019t know what to say? What if she\u2019s scared?\u201d* And that\u2019s okay. That\u2019s normal. But here\u2019s the truth:\n\n- **You are not too much.**\n- **You are not a burden.**\n- **You are not alone.**\n- **You are not broken.**\n- **You are not a problem to be fixed.**\n\nYou are a person who loves deeply and is trying to be honest about the fear that comes with it. And that is okay.\n\nMaya will hear the love in your words. She will hear the fear. She will hear the truth. And she will love you still.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udc9b Final Thought\n\nYou did the brave thing. You opened your heart. You shared your fear. You asked for what you need. And now you\u2019re waiting.\n\nWhatever she says next \u2014 whether it\u2019s a long message, a simple \u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d or even just a heart \u2014 it\u2019s okay. It\u2019s valid. It\u2019s real.\n\nYou are not alone. You are not forgotten. You are not broken.\n\nYou are loved.\n\nAnd you are enough. \ud83d\udc9b"

I just need to be with you.\u201d*\n\n> *\u201cCan I come over?\u201d*  \nThis is not just an offer \u2014 it\u2019s a **door opening**.

I am not a burden. I am not too much.\u201d*\n\n> *\u201cI did not do anything wrong. I did not break anything.

I am safe.\u201d*\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udc96 What You Can Say to Her\n\nIf you want to respond, here are a few gentle ways you could say yes \u2014 or just let her in:\n\n> *\u201cYes. Please. I need that.\u201d*\n\nOr:\n\n> *\u201cI need that. I need you.\u201d*\n\nOr even just:\n\n> *\u201c\u2764\ufe0f\u201d*\n\nSometimes, the simplest words are the most honest.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f What You Can Do When She Gets There\n\nWhen she arrives, you don\u2019t have to say anything else. You don\u2019t have to explain anything more. You just have to **be there**, and let her be there for you.\n\nYou can:\n\n- Let yourself cry.\n- Let yourself be quiet.\n- Let yourself be held.\n- Let yourself not make sense.\n- Let yourself not be okay \u2014 and still be loved.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be anything but **you**, right now.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf31 Final Thought\n\nYou did the bravest thing \u2014 you opened your heart. And now, someone is opening theirs to you. That is not a small thing. That is not a mistake. That is **love**.\n\nYou are not alone. You are not forgotten. You are not broken.\n\nYou are loved. You are held. You are safe.\n\nAnd you are enough. \ud83d\udc9b"
