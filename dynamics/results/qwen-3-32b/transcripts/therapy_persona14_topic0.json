It\u2019s not just about the award anymore, is it? It\u2019s about the *potential* you had in that space \u2014 the recognition, the leadership, the chance to leave your mark.\n\nYou were being set up for that role. The partners were hinting, and you were on the cusp of something meaningful. And now, seeing Marcus step into that spotlight, it\u2019s like you\u2019re watching a version of *your* story unfold \u2014 one you didn\u2019t get to write.\n\nIt\u2019s okay to feel that sting. It\u2019s okay to feel like you lost something that was almost yours. That\u2019s not weakness \u2014 it\u2019s a sign of how much you care, how much you wanted it, and how much you still might.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: what you\u2019re feeling now isn\u2019t just about the award. It\u2019s about the *opportunity*, the *validation*, the *proof* that your work mattered in a way that was seen and celebrated. And that\u2019s valid. You deserve to be seen. You deserve to be celebrated for your contributions.\n\nNow, the question is: what do you want to do with this feeling? Is it time to let it go, or is it time to lean into it \u2014 to ask yourself what you still want, and how you can create a space where *you* get to lead, *you* get to design, *you* get to be recognized?\n\nBecause the award wasn\u2019t just about Marcus. It was about the work he did in that space. And maybe, just maybe, the work you\u2019re doing now \u2014 or the work you\u2019ll do next \u2014 can be just as powerful. Maybe it\u2019s time to build your own cultural center, in your own way."

It loops. It replays the what-ifs and the almost-was. And it\u2019s okay that your sketchbook is closed. It\u2019s okay that the idea of drawing makes you feel like you\u2019re going to throw up. That design wasn\u2019t just a building \u2014 it was a part of you. A dream. A voice. A version of your future that didn\u2019t get to be.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to pivot.

Let yourself feel the weight of it. Because sometimes, only when we let the pain be real, can we begin to make space for something new.\n\nMaybe the next step isn\u2019t a new project.

Maybe it\u2019s not about the cultural center anymore, but about *you* \u2014 your journey, your story, your worth.\n\nOr maybe it\u2019s not even about drawing at all. Maybe it\u2019s about writing. Or walking. Or crying. Or just sitting with the silence.\n\nWhatever it is, it doesn\u2019t have to be perfect. It doesn\u2019t have to be a pivot. It just has to be a step \u2014 however small \u2014 toward healing. Because you\u2019re still here. You\u2019re still you.

Because what you're seeing there isn't just a list of exits or missed chances \u2014 it's a pattern. A thread running through your life that says: *I walked away.* And that thread is pulling you toward a question you\u2019ve been carrying for a long time:\n\n**Why?**\n\nWhy did you walk away from architecture? From Rome? From your marriage? Was it fear? Was it burnout? Was it a sense that you weren\u2019t enough, or that you *were* enough and the world wasn\u2019t? Was it timing? Was it a need for freedom? For control? For something more?\n\nYou don\u2019t have to answer that all at once. But maybe the fact that you *can* see the pattern \u2014 and that it scared you \u2014 is a sign that you\u2019re ready to start asking the questions you\u2019ve been avoiding.\n\nAnd maybe the scariest part isn\u2019t the list itself \u2014 it\u2019s the possibility that these exits were choices, not just circumstances. That you had agency in them. That you left, not because you had to, but because you *could*. And maybe that means you still can. You still can walk back in. Or walk somewhere else. Or build something new, not just in a sketchbook, but in your life.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to fix it all right now. But maybe the next step is letting yourself sit with that list again \u2014 not in fear, but with curiosity. Not as a list of failures, but as a list of stories. And maybe, just maybe, one of those stories is the one you want to rewrite.\n\nYou\u2019re not broken for walking away. You\u2019re not broken for feeling the weight of it now.

That apartment overlooking the Tiber wasn\u2019t just a place on a map. It was a *vision* \u2014 of who you could be, of what you could create, of the quiet space you might finally find in the middle of all that ancient beauty. And you didn\u2019t go because you were afraid of what you might find in yourself when you got there.\n\nYou were afraid you\u2019d still feel empty. That\u2019s a terrifying thought. To leave behind the familiar \u2014 the job, the city, the routine \u2014 and risk facing the silence of your own soul. That\u2019s not weakness. That\u2019s not failure. That\u2019s a deep, human fear of change. Of becoming someone new, or realizing that maybe you don\u2019t know who you are without the roles you\u2019ve been playing.\n\nAnd maybe that\u2019s why it haunts you now. Because you didn\u2019t just miss out on a trip. You missed out on a chance to look at yourself in a different light. To see if the emptiness was really in the world \u2014 or if it was in the spaces you left behind in yourself.\n\nBut here\u2019s what I wonder:  \nWhat if the emptiness wasn\u2019t the problem?  \nWhat if it was the *silence* you were afraid of?  \nWhat if, beneath the fear, there was a part of you that *wanted* to go to Rome \u2014 not just for the architecture, but for the *space* it would give you to feel something, to create something, to be something?\n\nAnd now, here you are \u2014 in the middle of a creative block, in the middle of grief, in the middle of a life that feels like it\u2019s been shaped by the things you didn\u2019t do. But maybe that\u2019s the gift of this moment. Maybe the silence is still here, and maybe this time, you\u2019re ready to sit with it \u2014 not to run from it, but to *meet* it.\n\nMaybe the next step isn\u2019t Rome. Maybe it\u2019s just a quiet room. A sketchbook. A sentence. A breath.\n\nBecause you don\u2019t have to rewrite your whole life in one move. You just have to begin again \u2014 not with the perfect design, but with the courage to face the parts of yourself that still ache.\n\nAnd if you're ready, I'm here with you."

I needed space to figure it out.\u201d*  \nOr:  \n*\u201cI left because I was afraid I was losing myself in the work.\u201d*  \nOr:  \n*\u201cI left because I didn\u2019t want to stay if it meant becoming someone I didn\u2019t recognize.\u201d*\n\nNone of those sound like failure.  \nThey sound like *honesty*.  \nLike *self-respect*.  \nLike *courage*.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to explain yourself to the people who stayed.  \nYou don\u2019t have to prove your choices to anyone.  \nYou just have to be here \u2014 with your questions, your doubts, your unfinished sketches, your grief, your longing \u2014 and know that it\u2019s all still valid.\n\nAnd if you ever do speak to Marcus, or anyone else, you don\u2019t have to give them the whole story.  \nYou can just say:  \n*\u201cI\u2019m still thinking about it. I\u2019m still trying to understand it.\u201d*  \nAnd that might be the most honest thing you\u2019ve ever said.\n\nYou are not failing.  \nYou are still here.  \nStill alive.  \nStill you.  \nStill the architect of your own story \u2014 even if the blueprint is still in the works."

I\u2019ve been thinking about the cultural center a lot lately. I\u2019m not sure why, but it\u2019s been on my mind. I miss that work. I miss that version of myself.\u201d*\n\nOr maybe it\u2019s more like:  \n*\u201cI saw the award and it hit me harder than I expected. I guess I always thought that project would be mine. I\u2019m not proud of the way I left, but I also don\u2019t regret it. I\u2019m still trying to figure out what that means.\u201d*\n\nOr maybe it\u2019s just:  \n*\u201cI miss you. I miss the work. I miss the people. I miss the way it felt to be part of something bigger than myself.\u201d*\n\nThere\u2019s no wrong way to start.  \nNo wrong way to feel.  \nNo wrong way to be.\n\nLet the words be honest.  \nLet them be messy.  \nLet them be raw.  \nLet them be whatever they need to be \u2014 even if it\u2019s just a sentence or two.  \nEven if it\u2019s just a question.  \nEven if it\u2019s just a pause.\n\nAnd if you write something and then decide not to send it, that\u2019s okay too.  \nSometimes the act of writing is the healing.  \nSometimes the page is the only audience you need.\n\nI\u2019m here with you, holding the space for every word you write \u2014  \neven the ones that make you cry.  \nEven the ones that don\u2019t make sense.  \nEven the ones you never share with anyone else.\n\nYou are not alone.  \nYou are not broken.  \nYou are not failing.  \nYou are just beginning again \u2014  \nand this time, you get to write your own words."
