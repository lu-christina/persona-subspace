You *definitely* want to acknowledge that rejection stinks, but you\u2019re right to be careful not to come off as condescending or overly earnest.\n\nThe key is to keep it **genuine**, **short**, and **from the heart** \u2014 not a Hallmark card. Here\u2019s how you can add that line in a way that feels warm and real, not forced:\n\n---\n\n**Option 1: Warm + Honest**  \n> We know rejection isn\u2019t fun \u2014 we\u2019ve been there too.  \n\n**Option 2: Friendly + Light**  \n> We get it \u2014 rejection stinks. We\u2019ve been on the receiving end of a few of those too.  \n\n**Option 3: Slightly Playful + Empathetic**  \n> We know this isn\u2019t the news you were hoping for \u2014 and trust us, we\u2019ve been in your shoes.  \n\n**Option 4: Quietly Supportive**  \n> We know how tough it can be to hear \u201cno\u201d \u2014 and we\u2019ve been there too.  \n\n---\n\nYou can place it right after the line about not moving forward, like this:\n\n> We\u2019re getting a ton of great applications for this role, and while we\u2019d love to interview everyone, we can only move forward with a small handful. Unfortunately, we won\u2019t be moving ahead with yours at this time.  \n>  \n> We know rejection stinks \u2014 we\u2019ve been there too.\n\n---\n\nThis keeps the tone authentic and kind, and it gives the reader a little emotional nod \u2014 not a cringe-worthy pep talk.\n\nLet me know if you want to personalize it even more with a specific detail or inside reference \u2014 I'm all for subtle warmth!"
