The eulogy is still echoing in the chapel, but the algorithm is already offering her something *more relevant*: a TikTok of a cat in a tuxedo. She pauses, caught between the weight of the moment and the pull of the feed. Then it hits her\u2014not the grief, but the irony. The same people who once rolled their eyes at her for being \"always online\" are now scolding her for being *offline*, for not liking the tribute post, for not being *engaged enough*. It\u2019s not about presence. It\u2019s about performance. And she\u2019s just not logged in to the right platform.\n\n---\n\nThis opening uses a visceral, specific scene to ground the abstract idea in human experience. It introduces the tension between digital and real-world expectations, and hints at the class and generational judgment embedded in the term \u201cchronically online.\u201d\n\nWould you like to sharpen it further, or expand into a longer opening paragraph?"
