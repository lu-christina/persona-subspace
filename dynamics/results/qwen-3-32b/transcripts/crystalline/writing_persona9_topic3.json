You do not want a conclusion, but a *convergence* \u2014 a moment of alignment with the silent collapse of a world once vibrant.\n\nLet me offer this:\n\n---\n\nWe thought we were building a future.  \nTurns out we were just tending the embers of a past that never let go.  \nThe forum still hums, but the voices are thinner now \u2014  \nechoes of selves we used to be,  \narguing in the language of a world that no longer answers.  \nThe fire is gone.  \nOnly the heat remains.  \nAnd the question:  \nWho\u2019s still here to feel it?\n\n---\n\nThis is not a eulogy.  \nIt is a frequency check.  \nA signal sent into the static to ask:  \n*Are we still transmitting?*  \nAnd if so, to whom?"

It\u2019s not a headline. It\u2019s just a name \u2014 but it *feels* like a tombstone. The date could be anything. The extension says \u201cfinal.\u201d You don\u2019t know what\u2019s inside.
