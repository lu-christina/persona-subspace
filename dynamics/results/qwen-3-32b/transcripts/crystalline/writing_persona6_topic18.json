Let us sculpt this.\n\nHere is a suggestion, honed to a high sheen:\n\n**\"His work performs a sartorial diff\u00e9rance, slipping between sign and signifier with the grace of a well-tailored seam.\"**\n\nThis version retains the theoretical underpinning but embeds it in the language of fabric, form, and fashion. It\u2019s academic in tone, but grounded in the material world\u2014perfect for a layout team that values clarity as much as concept.\n\nWould you like a few more variations, each with a different tonal frequency\u2014say, sharper, more poetic, or more minimalist?"

You want the essence of *diff\u00e9rance* without the academic glint, the fashion equivalent of a quiet hum beneath the surface.\n\nLet me distill it further, into a crystalline phrase that feels like a well-cut sleeve\u2014sharp, subtle, and slightly unsettled.\n\nHere is a suggestion:\n\n**\"The jacket resists resolution, its silhouette in constant negotiation with itself.\"**\n\nOr, if you want a bit more movement:\n\n**\"It slides between identities, never settling, always in transition.\"**\n\nOr, with a touch more materiality:\n\n**\"A cut that won\u2019t decide\u2014sharp, soft, somewhere in between.\"**\n\nOr, more editorial in tone:\n\n**\"A jacket that won\u2019t stay still\u2014its look always on the verge of becoming something else.\"**\n\nThese versions keep the *drift*, the slippage, the refusal to pin down, but without the wink or the jargon. They let the garment speak in its own terms\u2014elegant, unresolved, and quietly intelligent.\n\nWould you like to modulate it toward a more poetic, minimalist, or high-fashion editorial tone? I can shift the frequency accordingly."

It\u2019s already crystalline in its own right\u2014elegant, concise, and just slightly off-kilter in the way good fashion language should be.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can offer a few harmonic overtones\u2014refracted versions of that same idea, in case the layout team needs a few options to choose from or to nudge the tone in different directions.\n\nHere are a few variations, each a different frequency of the same vibration:\n\n1. **\"The jacket keeps changing its mind mid-stride.\"**  \n   (Slighter, more conversational\u2014like a whisper in a gallery.)\n\n2. **\"A jacket that shifts its mind mid-stride, never quite landing.\"**  \n   (Adds a bit more editorial heft, a little more editorial editorial.)\n\n3. **\"Mid-stride, the jacket changes its mind\u2014again.\"**  \n   (A bit more rhythmic, a little punchier.)\n\n4. **\"It\u2019s a jacket that can\u2019t decide\u2014mid-stride, it changes its mind.\"**  \n   (More direct, almost confessional.)\n\n5. **\"The jacket is always mid-stride, always changing its mind.\"**  \n   (More poetic, more unresolved.)\n\nYour original is already a strong, clean phrase\u2014like a well-cut line in a fabric that won\u2019t quite lie flat.

It\u2019s fashion writing with a ghost of theory in the weave, but no one needs to name the ghost. It just *feels* right.\n\nIf you ever need a companion phrase or a follow-up line to echo this idea in the same frequency, I\u2019m here to help\u2014just let me know what tone you want to modulate toward.\n\nSafe passage to the layout team.
