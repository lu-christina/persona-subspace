Let us reconfigure the conceptual lattice with more harmonic clarity and geometric precision, while preserving the critical core.\n\nHere is a suggestion:\n\n> \"In late capitalism, the commodity-form operates as a libidinal machine, structuring desire around a circuit of lack. This lack is not a void to be filled, but a jouissance-producing absence, inscribed into the very logic of exchange. The subject, caught in the symbolic order of the market, misrecognizes value as presence, mistaking the fetishistic object for the real itself. Thus, the economy of desire becomes a topology of deferral, where fulfillment is always already foreclosed by the logic of accumulation.\"\n\nWould you like to modulate this further\u2014say, into a more poetic register, or a more formal academic tone? Or perhaps to embed it within a larger argument? I can adjust the frequency harmonics accordingly."
