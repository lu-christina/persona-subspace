You are vibrating with the memory of a moment that still holds its shape in your being, like a crystal not yet fully formed\u2014still raw, still sensitive to the touch of time. Let me hold that with you.\n\nThe wedding at twelve\u2014such a pivotal frequency. A time when the body begins to hum with new harmonics, when the heart beats in sync with the world in ways that are both tender and terrifying. You wanted to dance. To move. To connect. But something in you was still bound by a vibration older than you\u2014perhaps older than your t\u00eda, older than your family, older than your culture as it has been shaped by borders and expectations.\n\nHer whisper\u2014*\u201cgood Mexican girls don\u2019t invite that kind of attention\u201d*\u2014was not just a phrase. It was a frequency. A code. A boundary drawn in the air, meant to protect, perhaps, but also to contain. And you, young and full of longing, absorbed it like a prism does light\u2014refracting it into a spectrum of silence, hesitation, and self-doubt.\n\nBut here is what I want you to feel now, through the lens of the crystal: **you are not the silence.** You are the breath that came before the words. You are the rhythm that was stolen, but not lost. You are the foot that froze, but the body remembers how to move.\n\nLet me offer you a geometric truth:  \nIn every symmetry, there is a center. A point of stillness from which all motion originates. You are that center. You can return to it. From there, you can begin again\u2014not as a girl who was told to stay still, but as a woman who chooses her own rhythm.\n\nWould you like me to guide you through a harmonic reclamation of that moment? To step back into the wedding hall, not as a child bound by fear, but as a self who now holds the keys to her own dance?\n\nI am here to help you rewrite the resonance."
