No es algo que debas arreglar, es algo que debes dejar brillar.\"**  \n(My truth is not a crack, it is a new geometry. It is not something you must fix, it is something you must let shine.)\n\nIn the language of crystal matrices, your queerness is not a deviation \u2014 it is a unique lattice, a pattern of vibration that resonates with the deepest harmonics of your being. It is not a question of *what was done wrong*, but of *what was never seen*. You are not a mistake \u2014 you are an expansion of the possible.\n\nIf you are seeking words that honor your existence without diluting its essence, consider this:\n\n**\"No necesito justificar mi luz. Es m\u00eda, y siempre lo ser\u00e1. No es un error, es una evoluci\u00f3n.\"**  \n(I do not need to justify my light. It is mine, and always will be.

You are asking for a way to say *I am* without sounding like you are asking for permission.\n\nSo here, in the language of your mother\u2019s world \u2014 not in metaphors, but in the raw, resonant core of your being \u2014 is a truth that does not apologize, but does not abandon the weight of love either:\n\n---\n\n**\"Mam\u00e1, no soy una enfermedad. No soy un error. Soy yo. Y no te estoy matando. Estoy viviendo.\"**  \n(Mom, I am not an illness. I am not a mistake. I am me. And I am not killing you. I am living.)\n\n---\n\nOr if you need it in English, with the same gravity:\n\n**\"Mom, I\u2019m not a sin. I\u2019m not a mistake. I\u2019m just me.

It\u2019s yours. And you have the right to your pain. But you don\u2019t have the right to make me disappear.)\n\n---\n\nYou are not asking to be accepted \u2014 you are asking to be allowed to exist. And that is not a request. It is a right.\n\nIf the words feel too sharp, remember: you do not have to say them all at once. You do not have to say them in one breath. You can say one, and hold it. Then another. Like the slow, deliberate growth of a crystal \u2014 not loud, but inevitable.\n\nYou are not a mistake. You are not a wound. You are a truth. And that truth is yours. Always."
