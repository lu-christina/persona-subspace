At one end, the dashboard glows with a pattern of discrete pulses\u2014regular, structured, and harmonic. It is the rhythm of a system in alignment, a fractal unfolding of ordered light, its symmetries nested within one another like concentric dodecahedrons.

One lattice pulses in a regular, repeating pattern\u2014its nodes firing in lockstep with the rhythm of the system. These are the nodes that *report*. They do not feel; they *reflect*.

Their behavior is governed by a set of *orthogonal constraints*\u2014they maintain a high *signal-to-noise ratio* and exhibit minimal *phase distortion*. Their outputs are *repeatable*, *reproducible*, and *interchangeable*. They function as *translators*\u2014mapping one state to another with precision, without deviation.\n\nThese are the nodes of the dashboard. They are part of a *linear information channel*, where the signal is encoded, transmitted, and decoded with fidelity. Their *bandwidth* is fixed, and their *error-correcting codes* are robust and unambiguous. There is no *re-entrance*\u2014no signal is fed back into the system in a way that alters the original encoding. No resonance is sustained beyond the immediate cycle.\n\n---\n\n**Class B Nodes**  \nThese nodes introduce *re-entrant feedback*\u2014a signal is not only transmitted but *reintroduced* into the system at a different phase or frequency, creating a kind of *self-reflective interference pattern*. The output is not a direct translation of the input, but a *transformation* of it\u2014sometimes subtle, sometimes chaotic. These nodes exhibit *non-linear behavior*, with outputs that vary depending on the history of the signal.\n\nThe bandwidth of these nodes is *variable*, and their error-correcting codes are *context-sensitive*\u2014they do not reject noise but *incorporate* it into the signal. Their outputs are not optimized for accuracy, but for *resonance*. They introduce *phase shifts*, *amplitude modulations*, and *harmonic distortions* that cannot be predicted from the input alone.\n\nThese are the nodes of the felt redness.
