I know we\u2019ve talked about sustainability, but I\u2019ve been watching how the conversation is shifting, especially with Gen Z and the quiet luxury angle.\n\nAnd I noticed that Aiayu just rolled out something similar last week \u2014 they\u2019re leaning into the 2014 Tumblr vibe, the indie sleaze, the nostalgia angle. It\u2019s not just a Gen Z thing, it\u2019s actually resonating across platforms, even on LinkedIn.\n\nSo I\u2019ve been sketching out a few ideas around that \u2014 using TikTok for short, stats-driven content that feels a little more cultural than educational, and LinkedIn for a more reflective, thought leadership angle. It\u2019s still a work in progress, but I think it could help us stand out in a space that\u2019s getting more crowded.\n\nI\u2019m not 100% sure yet, though \u2014 I just wanted to get your take. Is this something that makes sense for us? I\u2019d love to run the ideas by you and see if we can build something that feels both relevant and strategic.\u201d\n\n---\n\nThis version:\n\n- Sounds like you're **not overreaching**, but **thoughtfully exploring**\n- Shows you're **aware of the competition**, not copying\n- Invites **collaboration**, not just approval\n- Leaves the door open for **feedback**, not just sign-off\n\nWant a **text version** of this for a follow-up email or a **visual outline** of the ideas to send along with it? I can help you package this for a quick meeting or a message that feels like a natural next step."

You\u2019re not just seeking approval \u2014 you\u2019re **positioning for momentum**, whether it\u2019s a \u201cyes\u201d or a \u201clet\u2019s test it.\u201d Let\u2019s crystallize three **low-risk, high-insight experiments** that still test the core concepts of your strategy: **nostalgic storytelling, sustainability messaging, and multi-platform brand voice**.\n\nThese are small enough to feel safe, but smart enough to prove value.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\uddea **3 Low-Risk Experiments to Test the Strategy**\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Mini TikTok A/B Test (1\u20132 weeks)**  \n**Goal:** Test the *2014 Tumblr + sustainability* angle with minimal investment.  \n**What to do:**  \n- Post **2 short TikTok videos** with the same recycled wool scarf content, but different tones:  \n  - **A)** The \u201cquiet luxury\u201d version: soft, elegant, stats-focused.  \n  - **B)** The \u201cindie sleaze\u201d version: nostalgic, a little edgy, meme-like.  \n- Use the same caption and visuals, just tweak the tone.  \n- Track: **Engagement rate, watch time, shares, and link clicks**.  \n\n**Why it works:**  \n- You\u2019re testing *voice* and *aesthetic* without overcommitting.  \n- If one version performs significantly better, you\u2019ll have data to return with.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **LinkedIn Story Series (1 post/week for 4 weeks)**  \n**Goal:** Test the *thought leadership* angle without a full campaign.  \n**What to do:**  \n- Publish a short, reflective LinkedIn post each week, using the **\u201c14-\u00e5rige mig\u201d** or **\u201cI remember when\u2026\u201d** framing.  \n  - Example: *\u201cI remember when the biggest crisis in my life was deleting an AIM profile. Now I\u2019m thinking about carbon footprints.\u201d*  \n- Tie each post to a **single sustainability stat or concept** (e.g., circular economy, textile waste, carbon savings).  \n- Keep it personal, not promotional.  \n\n**Why it works:**  \n- It builds **brand authority** slowly and authentically.  \n- If it gains traction, you can expand it into a full content pillar.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Email Subject Line Test (2 weeks)**  \n**Goal:** Test the *nostalgia + sustainability* hook in a low-stakes, high-impact channel.  \n**What to do:**  \n- Send the same newsletter to two segments with **different subject lines**:  \n  - **A)** \u201c0.8kg CO\u2082 \u2014 your new favorite scarf\u2019s secret\u201d  \n  - **B)** \u201cIndie sleaze but make it sustainable. 0.8kg CO\u2082 vs 5.2kg\u201d  \n\n**Track:**  \n- Open rates, click-through rates, and conversion to product page.  \n\n**Why it works:**  \n- You\u2019re testing *tone and framing* in a channel where you already have a relationship.  \n- You can show how language impacts customer behavior \u2014 without spending on ads or campaigns.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 Bonus: How to Frame the Backup Plan to Your CEO\n\n> \u201cIf we\u2019re not ready to go all-in on this strategy, I\u2019d love to test a few smaller experiments that still let us explore the same concepts \u2014 like a quick TikTok A/B test, a LinkedIn story series, or a subject line experiment. These are low-effort, low-cost, and they\u2019ll give us real feedback on what resonates. If the data looks good, we can scale from there.\u201d\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to help you draft the **exact subject lines**, **TikTok scripts**, or **LinkedIn post drafts** for these experiments? I can also help you set up a **quick report template** to show the results in a way that\u2019s easy to share with your CEO."

Use It Internally, Not Publicly**\n\nIf the phrase is too edgy for public use, use it as a **working concept internally** \u2014 for brainstorming, strategy, or campaign naming. You can still test the idea in a **safe way**, even if the exact phrase isn\u2019t approved.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **3. Propose a \u201cTone of Voice Experiment\u201d**\n\nIf the brand is open to innovation, you can frame it as a **test**:\n\n> *\u201cWe\u2019d like to test a new tone of voice that speaks to younger, more culturally aware audiences.
