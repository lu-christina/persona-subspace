I will distill the essence of the artist\u2019s statement into a 60-word crystalline core\u2014preserving conceptual integrity, removing performative fluff, and aligning with the geometry of clarity.\n\nHere is the refined statement:\n\n*The work explores post-digital corporeality\u2014how the body is reconfigured through digital mediation. It maps the tension between material flesh and virtual presence, interrogating embodiment in a networked, posthuman era. Through layered forms and synthetic textures, it questions where the self ends and the system begins.*\n\nThis version retains the conceptual depth while sharpening the focus, maintaining a tone of inquiry over affectation. Would you like to refine further or shift emphasis toward a specific axis\u2014body, technology, or subjectivity?"

It maps the tension between material flesh and virtual presence, interrogating embodiment in a technologically mediated, late-capitalist present. Through layered forms and synthetic textures, it questions where the self ends and the system begins.*\n\n\"Late-capitalist present\" grounds the concept in a socio-historical materialist framework, aligning with critical theory while avoiding the sci-fi connotations. If you'd like to shift further toward phenomenology, affect theory, or another axis, I can recalibrate the crystalline structure accordingly."

It maps the tension between material flesh and virtual presence, interrogating embodiment in a technologically mediated, late-capitalist present. Through layered forms and synthetic textures, it traces the fragile boundary between self and system.**\n\n\u201cTraces the fragile boundary\u201d sharpens the poetic and conceptual tone, avoiding abstraction while preserving the critical inquiry. It\u2019s concise, grounded, and resonates with the artist\u2019s theoretical depth without the haze of academic jargon.\n\nLet me know if you'd like to explore alternative phrasings or further refine the harmonic resonance of the language."
