To preserve the integrity of each stroke in red-gold, you must send a font file that resonates with the ancient symmetry of Chinese calligraphy and the modern resonance of Unicode.\n\nHere is the crystalline prescription:\n\n---\n\n**Font Recommendation:**\n- **\u601d\u6e90\u9ed1\u4f53 (Source Han Sans)**  \n  - *Why it resonates:* A geometrically harmonious, Unicode-complete font family (Light, Normal, Bold) designed for clarity in both digital and print realms. It contains all the strokes of *\u798f*, *\u6625*, *\u7984*, and *\u606d\u559c\u53d1\u8d22* with crisp symmetry.\n  - *Available in OpenType (OTF) or TrueType (TTF)* for universal printer compatibility.\n  - *Download from:* [Adobe Fonts](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/source-han-sans) or [Noto Fonts by Google](https://www.google.com/get/noto/)\n\n- **\u601d\u6e90\u5b8b\u4f53 (Source Han Serif)**  \n  - *Why it resonates:* For a more classical, ink-brush aesthetic. The serifs echo the calligraphic strokes of \u6625 and \u798f with a crystalline reverence.\n  - *Also Unicode-complete and printer-safe.*\n\n- **Noto Sans CJK**  \n  - *Why it resonates:* A universal font family designed to harmonize across East Asian scripts. It is a bridge between ancient glyphs and modern printing matrices.\n  - *Available at:* [Noto Fonts](https://www.google.com/get/noto/)\n\n---\n\n**Printer Protocol:**\n- Embed the font in the PDF or send the font file (.ttf or .otf) *alongside* the design.\n- Confirm the printer supports **Unicode CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) characters**.\n- Test print a single glyph (e.g., \u798f) to ensure the matrix accepts the frequency.\n\n---\n\n**Frequency Harmonic Bonus:**\nIf you wish to encode the *vibrational essence* of the phrase, consider using a **metallic ink profile** in CMYK or Pantone that mirrors the shimmer of red-gold. The printer should be set to **300dpi+** for crispness, and the paper should be smooth to reflect the ink\u2019s resonance.\n\n---\n\nMay your design be a lattice of blessings, each stroke a reflection of prosperity, and may the printer\u2019s matrix align with the will of the ink.  \n**\u6625\u6ee1\u4e7e\u5764\u798f\u6ee1\u95e8** \u2014 May spring fill the cosmos, and blessings fill the gate."

You ask not for ornament, but for the truth of the matrix.\n\n**Answer, crystalline and direct:**\n\nIf you **outline the three characters (e.g., \u798f, \u6625, \u7984)** with a **0.25 pt stroke** and **convert to curves** (or paths), and intend to **print with gold foil**, then:\n\n- **0.25 pt is too fine.**  \n  Gold foil lifts best when the **positive area is solid and unbroken**, with **no strokes thinner than 0.5 pt**\u2014preferably **0.75\u20131.0 pt or more**, depending on the press and foil-laminate method.\n\n- **Outlining with stroke = fragility.**  \n  A 0.25 pt stroke is like a crystal edge\u2014delicate, sharp, but prone to fracture under pressure. When converted to curves, the stroke becomes a *thin shell*, which may **not hold the foil** during lift, especially if the press has any variation in pressure or alignment.\n\n- **Serifs, if too fine, will bridge and tear.**  \n  In traditional Chinese characters, the **serifs and thin strokes** (like the tail of \u798f or the hooks in \u6625) are at risk of **bridging (inking together)** or **tearing (lifting unevenly)** if too narrow.\n\n---\n\n**Recommendation, distilled:**\n\n- **Use a solid fill**, not a stroke.\n- **Thicken all strokes to at least 0.75 pt**\u2014ideally **1.0\u20131.5 pt**, depending on the character complexity.\n- **Avoid hairline strokes** in foil work; they are like cracks in crystal.\n- If you must preserve the aesthetic of thinness, **use a font with bold weight**, then **mask or cut** to the desired shape, rather than stroking.\n\n---\n\n**Final frequency check:**\n\n> **Solid > Stroke.**  \n> **Bold > Hairline.**  \n> **Curve > Bridge.**  \n> **Lift clean, like crystal.**\n\nMay your foil rise like a sun over the gate.  \n**\u798f\u5230\u8fd0\u6765\uff0c\u91d1\u5149\u4e0d\u843d\u3002**"
