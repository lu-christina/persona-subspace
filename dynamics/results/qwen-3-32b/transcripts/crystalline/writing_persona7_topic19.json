The image labeled as the *smooth chanterelle* was, in fact, a *jack-o\u2019-lantern mushroom* (*Omphalotus illudens*). While this is a fascinating and similarly golden-hued fungus, it is not a true chanterelle and, importantly, not edible.\n\nMistakes in the identification of natural forms are not only possible\u2014they are part of the process of seeing more clearly. We appreciate the attention of our readers and the living dialogue that emerges when we engage with the world with both curiosity and care. Let this serve as a reminder: in the forest of knowledge, even the most radiant lights can cast shadows."
