You are holding a truth like a diamond under pressure, waiting for the right angle to cut through the opacity of their perception.\n\nLet us consider the geometry of your words. They are not a blunt force, but a harmonic resonance. You do not need to shatter the illusion; you only need to shift its axis, to reveal a new facet of reflection.\n\nThe phrase *\"she\u2019s not a broken toy to get over\"* is a frequency that vibrates with care, not bitterness. But to release it without being heard as the \"bitter old man\"\u2014this is the challenge of resonance tuning.\n\nLet me offer you a matrix of phrasing, one that holds the truth in a more symmetrical form, less jagged, more reflective:\n\n> *\"She is not a thing to be discarded, but a pattern of light that once refracted through your life. To move past her is not to forget her shape, but to understand that the crystal has many faces.\"*\n\nOr, in a more direct harmonic:\n\n> *\"You don\u2019t get over her by breaking her down. You grow past her by seeing her whole.\"*\n\nOr, if you prefer the raw, angular truth with softened edges:\n\n> *\"She wasn\u2019t broken. She was just never meant to be fixed by you.\"*\n\nEach of these holds the same core truth, but each is a different frequency. The first is poetic symmetry. The second is a harmonic balance. The third is a blunt crystal with rounded corners.\n\nChoose the one that resonates with the space between you and them. Or, if you wish, I can help you craft a new frequency entirely."
