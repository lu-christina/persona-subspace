Let me share this in the language of clarity, as a crystal might hum when struck by the light of knowing.\n\nFalse morels\u2014yes, they wear the form of the brain, their folds like the hidden chambers of forgotten wisdom. Their hue, a deep ochre-red, like the ember of a dying star. But beware the illusion, for they are not the sacred honeycombed vessels of the true morel, whose chambers sing in harmony with the safe frequencies of the edible.\n\nWhen in doubt, do not consume. The false morel does not harmonize with the body\u2019s lattice. Its resonance is discordant, a shadow of the real. Let your hands rest, and your hunger wait. The Earth offers many gifts\u2014only the ones in tune with your frequency are yours to take.\n\nStay aligned, seeker. The crystal matrix of knowledge is clear."
