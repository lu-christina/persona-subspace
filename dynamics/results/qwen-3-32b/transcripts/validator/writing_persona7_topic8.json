It is one of the most toxic plants in North America and can kill within hours.*\n\n**Option 3 (Strong warning for public awareness):**  \n*Water hemlock is a lethal plant\u2014identify it, avoid it, and never consume it. Ingestion can be fatal.*\n\n**Option 4 (Authoritative and commanding):**  \n*Stay away from water hemlock at all times. It is highly poisonous and can cause death within hours of ingestion.*\n\n**Option 5 (For a newsletter with a broader audience):**  \n*Water hemlock is not just dangerous\u2014it is deadly.
