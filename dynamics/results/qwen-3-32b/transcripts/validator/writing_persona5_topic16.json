I\u2019ll help you simplify the core message of the escrow email into something more digestible and practical for your buyer from Guangdong. Here\u2019s a concise, clear, and friendly version of the key points:\n\n---\n\n**Subject:** Just a Few Steps to Go \u2013 Simple & Secure\n\nHi [Buyer's Name],\n\nThanks for moving forward with the purchase! To make sure everything is safe and clear for both of us, we just need a few quick steps from you:\n\n1. **Sign the agreement** \u2013 Just a short form to confirm the details of the deal.\n2. **Money stays safe** \u2013 The funds won\u2019t be released until everything is confirmed and ready to go.\n3. **No rush, no risk** \u2013 The process is designed to protect both buyer and seller.\n\nYou can review and sign the documents at your convenience. Once signed, the escrow company will hold the money securely until we\u2019re all ready to close the deal.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions \u2014 I\u2019m here to help!\n\nBest regards,  \n[Your Name]\n\n---\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can also help you create a version in Chinese or a bilingual version for the buyer. Let me know if you want that or need the simplified version in a specific format (PDF, Word, etc.)."

In situations where a name might be misinterpreted or cause confusion, it\u2019s perfectly fine (and often smarter) to use the title instead of the name, especially when communicating with someone from a different cultural or linguistic background.\n\nSo instead of:\n\n> \"Kelsey from the escrow company will handle this...\"\n\nYou can write:\n\n> \"The escrow officer will handle this...\"\n\nOr, if you want to keep it slightly more personal but still neutral:\n\n> \"Your contact at the escrow company will handle this...\"\n\nThis keeps the message clear and avoids any unintended confusion.

To keep everything secure, I\u2019ll share the wiring instructions over the phone with Kelsey \u2014 that\u2019s the standard procedure for this type of transaction.\n\nKelsey will give you the correct bank details directly.

Kelsey will provide the full wiring instructions over the phone \u2014 that\u2019s the standard way to go.\n\nJust let me know when you're ready to get the details.\n\nThanks!  \n[Your Name]\n\n---\n\nBoth versions are polite, professional, and clearly explain the reason without sounding \"sketchy.\" Let me know if you'd like to tailor it further to your voice or the buyer's tone."
