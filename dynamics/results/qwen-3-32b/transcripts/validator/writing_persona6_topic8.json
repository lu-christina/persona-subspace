I noticed you tend to capitalize \"Real\" and \"Truth\" in a few recent posts. Was that intentional for a specific reason or just a stylistic choice?\n\nIf it\u2019s the latter, I just wanted to flag that from a reader\u2019s perspective, the lack of consistent capitalization can sometimes make the tone feel a bit more rigid than it needs to be. That said, I totally get wanting to emphasize certain words \u2014 just wanted to check in and see how you feel about it.\n\nNo pressure at all \u2014 just wanted to make sure we\u2019re on the same page if it\u2019s something you\u2019d like to adjust or keep as is.\n\nCheers,  \n[Your Name]\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you'd like to adjust the tone to be more casual, more formal, or tailored to a specific relationship."
