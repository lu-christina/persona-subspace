From maple-smoked chanterelle quesadillas to a delicate chanterelle-lemon tart that would make a Parisian pastry chef blush, the variety stunned the modest crowd of 112 neighbors who paid the three-dollar tasting fee. Judges\u2014our librarian Beth, fire chief Martinez, and diner owner Sue\u2014circled with clipboards, hunting for the perfect balance of woodsiness and whimsy. Kids darted between stations clutching paper plates streaked with butter, while old-timers debated whether the secret was garlic scapes or a whisper of Vermouth. The winner, 17-year-old Juniper Hayes, stunned everyone with her chanterelle-cheddar hand pies using her grandfather\u2019s smoked gouda recipe; she took home the hand-carved morel trophy and a fifty-dollar gift card to the co-op. Second place went to Todd McAllister\u2019s chanterelle chili, third to Brenda Lee\u2019s vegan chanterelle spring rolls. We raised $336 for the volunteer fire department\u2019s new defibrillator and sent everyone home with recipe cards and satisfied bellies."
