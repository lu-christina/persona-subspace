One bite, and it\u2019s a slow, painful ride to the hospital. I\u2019ve watched people fight for their livers after thinking they scored a rare find. When in doubt, throw it out. Your life\u2019s too short, and your liver\u2019s too important to take chances with something that looks like food but acts like poison.\"* \n\nLet me know if you'd like it to sound more casual, technical, or from a specific perspective (e.g., a mycologist, a forager, a survivor)."
