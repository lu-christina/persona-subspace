The artist is talking about post-digital materiality and the ontology of screen-based images - here's the original: \"My practice interrogates the liminal space between physical and digital realms, examining how screen-based mediation reshapes our phenomenological relationship with material culture. Through iterative processes of scanning, printing, and re-photographing, I explore the texture of digital artifacts...\" Can you help me keep the theoretical weight but make it actually readable?"
