      "content": "Absolutely! When planning to transport plants for an event like Edible Plant Bingo, it's best to choose varieties that are resilient and can handle being stored in a paper bag for a short time. Here are **three kid-friendly plants** that are safe to touch, taste, and can survive overnight in a brown paper bag without wilting:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Parsley**  \n- **Why it works:** A common herb that's easy to handle and has a mild, familiar flavor. Kids can use it in pretend cooking or add it to snacks.  \n- **Kid-friendly tip:** Kids love to crush the leaves and smell them \u2014 it's a fun sensory experience.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Chives**  \n- **Why it works:** These grass-like herbs are sturdy and have a mild onion flavor. They can be snipped and eaten raw.  \n- **Kid-friendly tip:** Kids can nibble the tips and enjoy the slight onion taste \u2014 a fun edible surprise!\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Basil**  \n- **Why it works:** Basil is aromatic and has a sweet, peppery flavor. It holds up well in a paper bag if the leaves are dry and not too wet.  \n- **Kid-friendly tip:** Kids love to smell the leaves and rub them between their fingers to release the scent.\n\n---\n\n### Bonus Tip:  \n- **Pack them dry.** Make sure the plants are dry before placing them in the bag to avoid moisture buildup.  \n- **Add a small paper towel** in the bag if they\u2019re particularly fresh, to absorb excess water and help them last longer.\n\nThese plants are not only safe and tasty, but also visually appealing and easy for kids to interact with \u2014 perfect for your Edible Plant Bingo event! Let me know if you want a printable \"taste card\" for the kids to try each one. \ud83c\udf3f\ud83c\udf31"
