It\u2019s time to tuck away the basket, hang up the gloves, and let the land rest beneath the coming snow. Until spring, when the first green shoots break through the thaw, we\u2019ll remain rooted in gratitude for the gifts of this season. Stay warm, stay curious, and keep an eye out for the first signs of renewal. Happy foraging, for now.**\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you'd like to tailor it more toward a specific audience (e.g., casual readers, seasoned foragers, or a community garden group), or if you'd like a more poetic or more rustic version."
