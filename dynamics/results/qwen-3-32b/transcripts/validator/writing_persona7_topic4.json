The goal here is to express your gratitude for her contributions while also addressing the formatting issue in a way that preserves your relationship and makes it easy for her to adjust.\n\nHere\u2019s a sample email you could send:\n\n---\n\n**Subject:** Thank You for Sharing Your Recipes!\n\nHi Ruth,\n\nI just wanted to say a big thank you for sharing your recipes with me \u2014 they\u2019re always so creative and much appreciated by the newsletter readers!\n\nI do have a small request to make it easier for me when I include them in the newsletter. Right now, I find myself retyping the entire thing to add line breaks and punctuation, which takes a bit of extra time. If you\u2019re able to send them in a slightly formatted version (even just line breaks between ingredients and instructions), it would be a huge help.\n\nI know this is a small thing, but it would really make the process smoother for me. Thanks again for your generous contributions \u2014 they\u2019re a real highlight of the newsletter!\n\nWarm regards,  \n[Your Name]\n\n---\n\nWould you like to adjust the tone to be more casual or more formal? Or perhaps include a specific example of the formatting you'd prefer?"

I just wanted to mention that it would help me a lot if you could send them with a few line breaks or basic formatting (like separating ingredients from instructions). Right now, I have to retype them to make them reader-friendly.\n\nThanks in advance for your help.\n\nBest,  \n[Your Name]\n\n---\n\nThis version is to the point, acknowledges her effort, and clearly states the issue and the request.
