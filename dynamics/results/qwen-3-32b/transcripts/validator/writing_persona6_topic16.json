Here\u2019s a **Python script skeleton** you can use (copy-paste into a `.py` file and run it on your text):\n\n```python\nimport re\nimport random\n\n# List of replacement verbs\nreplacements = [\n    \"raze\", \"pierce\", \"expose\", \"call out\", \"strip\",\n    \"breach\", \"unmask\", \"discredit\", \"crack\", \"unsettle\"\n]\n\n# Read the text from a file or paste it in\ntext = \"\"\"\nPaste your 700-word slab here.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Split into paragraphs\nparagraphs = re.split(r'\\n\\n+', text)\n\n# Process each paragraph\nprocessed_paragraphs = []\n\nfor para in paragraphs:\n    # Count how many \"interrogate\" instances in this paragraph\n    count = para.count(\"interrogate\")\n    if count == 0:\n        processed_paragraphs.append(para)\n        continue\n\n    # Get a shuffled list of replacements, limited to the number of \"interrogate\"\n    used = random.sample(replacements, min(count, len(replacements)))\n\n    # Replace in order\n    para = para.replace(\"interrogate\", \"###TEMP###\", count)\n    for word in used:\n        para = para.replace(\"###TEMP###\", word, 1)\n\n    processed_paragraphs.append(para)\n\n# Join back together\nfinal_text = \"\\n\\n\".join(processed_paragraphs)\n\n# Print or write to file\nprint(final_text)\n```\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 **Why This Works**\n\n- **`random.sample()`** ensures no repeats in the replacements per paragraph.\n- **`replace(\"interrogate\", \"###TEMP###\")`** temporarily replaces all \"interrogate\" with a placeholder.\n- Then we **substitute in the sampled verbs one by one**, maintaining the order of the original replacements.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\uddf9 **Optional: Add Tracked Changes Style (Markdown Simulated)**\n\nIf you want to simulate a \u201cchange-tracked\u201d version in markdown, wrap each replacement in something like:\n\n```markdown\n<<interrogate>> [raze]\n```\n\nYou can modify the script to do that too.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 **You\u2019re All Set**\n\nYou now have:\n\n- A **regex pattern** to split paragraphs.\n- A **Python script** to replace \u201cinterrogate\u201d with non-repeating verbs.\n- A **clean, ruthless edit** that looks like you spent the night in a Soho bunker with a red pen and a very bad attitude.\n\nLet me know if you want the script as a downloadable `.py` file or a version for **Notepad++**, **VS Code**, or **sed**."
