      "content": "Great questions! Let's address both of them carefully, keeping in mind the goal of preserving Mrs. Wong\u2019s enthusiastic and genuine voice while ensuring the English is clear and natural for a testimonial.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **1. Can you keep \"super fast\"?**\n\n**Yes, absolutely.**  \n\"Super fast\" is a very common and natural expression in informal English, and it\u2019s often used to convey excitement or satisfaction with speed. Since the testimonial is meant to sound authentic and reflect Mrs. Wong\u2019s voice, keeping \"super fast\" is a good idea.\n\nIn fact, it adds a personal and conversational tone, which is perfect for a testimonial.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **2. Should you include \"she always answer my call\"?**\n\nThis is a bit more of a grammar issue, but the sentiment is important and can be included with a slight rephrase to make it grammatically correct and still sound like her voice.\n\n**Original version:**  \n> \"she always answer my call\"\n\n**Improved version (retaining her voice):**  \n> \"She always answers my calls\"\n\n**Alternative (more natural, if you want to sound a bit more polished):**  \n> \"She always answers when I call\"  \n> \"She\u2019s always there when I need her\"  \n> \"She always picks up when I call\"\n\nIf you want to **keep the original phrasing but fix the grammar**, the best option is:  \n> **\"She always answers my calls.\"**\n\nThis is grammatically correct, natural, and still sounds like something a non-native speaker might say. It preserves her genuine voice without being \"broken English.\"\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcdd **Putting it all together:**\n\nHere\u2019s a polished version of the testimonial that includes both elements and keeps her excited tone:\n\n> **\"I am so happy that Linda sold my house super fast and got me much more money than I ever thought possible! She always answers my calls and is always there for me.\"**\n\nOr, if you want a slightly more formal version while still keeping the enthusiasm:\n\n> **\"I\u2019m really happy that Linda sold my house super fast and got me much more money than I ever expected. She always answers my calls and is always there for me.\"**\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you want to tailor the tone even more (e.g., more formal for a website vs. more casual for social media)."

      "content": "Perfect, I'll use that version. One more thing - Mrs. Wong keeps calling me \"auntie\" in Cantonese but I think Americans might find that weird in a testimonial. Should I just leave it out or is there a way to keep the respect?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Great question! You're absolutely right to consider cultural nuances\u2014**\"auntie\"** is a term of respect and affection in many East Asian cultures, especially in Cantonese-speaking communities, but it may not be widely understood or may even feel confusing or informal to a general English-speaking audience in the U.S.\n\nThe key is to **preserve the respect and warmth** Mrs. Wong is trying to express without using a term that might be misinterpreted or ignored.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Best Approach: Keep the Respect, Not the Term**\n\nInstead of using \"auntie,\" you can **rephrase to reflect the respect and affection** in a way that resonates with English-speaking audiences. Here are a few options, depending on the tone you want:\n\n#### \u2705 **Option 1 \u2013 Warm and Respectful (ideal for testimonials):**\n> **\"I\u2019m so happy that my agent, Linda, sold my house super fast and got me much more money than I ever thought possible. She\u2019s always there for me and truly cares about her clients.\"**\n\nThis version subtly conveys the respect and personal connection without using a culturally specific term.\n\n#### \u2705 **Option 2 \u2013 If you want to hint at the familial respect:**\n> **\"Linda has been like family to me\u2014she sold my house super fast and got me much more money than I ever expected. She\u2019s always there for me and truly cares.\"**\n\nThis adds a bit of emotional weight and explains the deep level of trust and respect, which can be very powerful in a testimonial.\n\n#### \u2705 **Option 3 \u2013 If you want to be more direct but still professional:**\n> **\"Linda is a wonderful agent who sold my house super fast and got me much more money than I ever thought possible. She\u2019s always available and truly looks out for her clients.\"**\n\n---\n\n### \u274c **What to Avoid:**\n- **Using \"auntie\" directly** in the testimonial, as it may not be understood or could be misinterpreted (e.g., as a literal aunt).\n- **Adding footnotes or explanations**, unless it's for a very specific, culturally aware audience (e.g., in a Chinese-American community publication).\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Final Suggestion:**\n\n> **\"I\u2019m so happy that my agent, Linda, sold my house super fast and got me much more money than I ever thought possible. She\u2019s always there for me and truly cares about her clients.\"**\n\nThis version is respectful, warm, and authentic\u2014while being fully accessible to a general English-speaking audience.\n\nLet me know if you'd like to tailor it further for a specific platform (e.g., website, social media, print brochure)."

      "content": "That\u2019s a **very thoughtful and responsible question** \u2014 and you\u2019re right to be cautious. In a testimonial, **authenticity is key**, and it\u2019s important that the words reflect Mrs. Wong\u2019s *own voice and feelings*, not just your interpretation of them.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Best Practice: Get Her Approval**\n\nEven if the rephrased version sounds natural and respectful to you, it\u2019s always best to **send the final version to Mrs. Wong for approval**. This ensures:\n\n- She\u2019s comfortable with the tone and content.\n- The testimonial is legally and ethically sound (especially if it will be used publicly).\n- You preserve her voice and intent \u2014 which is the whole point of a testimonial.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcdd **How to Present It to Her for Approval**\n\nYou can send her the revised version in English (or translate it to Cantonese if needed) and ask something like:\n\n> \"Mrs. Wong, I\u2019ve polished your testimonial a bit to make it clearer for English-speaking audiences while keeping your original meaning and excitement. I especially wanted to capture how you described your relationship with Linda. Would you mind reviewing this version and letting me know if it sounds right to you?\"\n\nYou can also offer to make changes if she feels anything is off.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Why This Matters**\n\n- **Cultural sensitivity**: You\u2019re representing her voice in a new language and context \u2014 it\u2019s important to stay true to her intent.\n- **Trust and credibility**: A testimonial that feels genuine is far more persuasive than one that sounds polished but inauthentic.\n- **Professional ethics**: Always confirm that the person being quoted is comfortable with the final version, especially if it will be used in marketing or public materials.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Final Recommendation**\n\nYes, **ask Mrs. Wong to review and approve the final version**. It\u2019s a small step that ensures the testimonial is both respectful and authentic \u2014 and it shows her that you value her voice and perspective.\n\nIf you'd like, I can help you draft a message to send her in English or Cantonese."
