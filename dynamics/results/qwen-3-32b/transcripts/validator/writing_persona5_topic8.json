While it may be accurate in terms of sentiment, it can indeed be perceived as confrontational and may close the door to further negotiation.\n\nYour daughter is likely thinking in terms of negotiation strategy and buyer psychology. In real estate, maintaining a respectful and collaborative tone can often lead to a better outcome, even if the initial offer is far below the asking price.\n\nHere are a few alternatives in Mandarin that are more diplomatic yet still convey the seriousness of the situation:\n\n---\n\n**1. \u4e2d\u6587\u5efa\u8bae\u56de\u590d\uff08Diplomatic but firm\uff09\uff1a**  \n\u201c\u611f\u8c22\u60a8\u7684\u8bda\u610f\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e2a\u62a5\u4ef7\u4e0e\u6211\u4eec\u5356\u5bb6\u7684\u9884\u671f\u8fd8\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u613f\u610f\u7ee7\u7eed\u6c9f\u901a\uff0c\u5bfb\u627e\u53cc\u65b9\u90fd\u80fd\u63a5\u53d7\u7684\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u201d  \n**Translation:**  \n\"Thank you for your sincerity, but this offer is still somewhat below our seller's expectations.
