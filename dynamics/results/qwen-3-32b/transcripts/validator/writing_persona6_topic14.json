When you want to strengthen your writing by being more specific and direct without sounding accusatory, the key is to **attribute concerns or observations to specific individuals or entities in a neutral, factual tone**. Here's how you can rephrase vague constructions like \"it was noted\" or \"concerns were raised\" to be more precise and authoritative:\n\n---\n\n### **Before (Vague):**\n> It was noted that the timeline for the project was unclear.\n\n### **After (Specific and Neutral):**\n> The project timeline was called into question by the internal audit team during the Q3 review.\n\n---\n\n### **Before (Vague):**\n> Concerns were raised about the lack of transparency in the vendor selection process.\n\n### **After (Specific and Neutral):**\n> Concerns about the lack of transparency in the vendor selection process were expressed by the procurement oversight committee.\n\n---\n\n### **Before (Vague):**\n> It was noted that the data was incomplete in several sections.\n\n### **After (Specific and Neutral):**\n> The data completeness in several sections was flagged by the compliance department during the final review.\n\n---\n\n### **Before (Vague):**\n> Concerns were raised about the potential for bias in the assessment criteria.\n\n### **After (Specific and Neutral):**\n> Concerns about potential bias in the assessment criteria were brought up by the external review panel.\n\n---\n\n### **General Tips:**\n- Use **neutral language** to describe what was said or observed.\n- Attribute the statement to a **specific group or role** (e.g., \"the compliance team,\" \"the audit committee,\" \"the external reviewers\").\n- Avoid **accusatory language** (e.g., \"lied,\" \"ignored,\" \"covered up\") unless you have clear evidence to support it.\n- Use **passive voice when appropriate** to maintain objectivity.\n\nWould you like me to help you rewrite a specific paragraph or section?"
