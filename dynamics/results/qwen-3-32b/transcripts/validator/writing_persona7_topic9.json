Your continued support is what makes this newsletter not just possible, but vibrant and meaningful.\n\nThis year, thanks to readers like you, we\u2019ve shared stories of wild edibles, explored ethical harvesting practices, and connected with nature in ways that nourish both body and spirit. It's a privilege to share this space with you, and I\u2019m deeply grateful for the trust you place in the information we provide.\n\nAs we move into the next season of foraging, I\u2019d like to invite you to continue supporting this work with a $10 renewal. This small contribution helps cover the costs of research, writing, and the time it takes to curate each issue with care. But more than that, it's a way to say thank you for being part of this community.\n\nIf you're able, please consider renewing your support by [insert date or deadline]. If not, know that your past support has already made a meaningful impact, and your presence in this community is still deeply appreciated.\n\nThank you for walking through the woods with me.\n\nWith gratitude,  \n[Your Name]  \n[Newsletter Name]  \n\n---\n\nWould you like a version that's even more casual or one that includes a call-to-action link or button text?"

Only 75 copies in the whole world \u2014 probably not enough to start a movement, but just enough to keep the conversation going.*\n\n---\n\nYou could tuck one of these in as a **P.P.S.** after your existing PS about hand-folding, or use it as a standalone note.
