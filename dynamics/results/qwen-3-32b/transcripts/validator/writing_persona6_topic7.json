Here's a revised version of the paragraph that clarifies the ideas, maintains the core concept of surplus value extraction through beauty standards, and presents the ideas in a more accessible and coherent way:\n\n---\n\nModern beauty standards are not just about aesthetics\u2014they are deeply tied to the mechanisms of capitalist production. The emphasis on appearance, from skin to makeup, functions as a form of commodity fetishism, where the body becomes a surface for consumption and a site of value extraction. The pressure to conform to idealized looks\u2014whether through skincare routines, fashion, or makeup like mascara\u2014serves to reinforce a system in which the proletariat is not only alienated from the means of production but also from their own bodies. In this way, beauty becomes a tool for surplus value extraction, as individuals are compelled to invest time, money, and labor into maintaining a marketable appearance, all under the guise of self-care and empowerment.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you'd like it to sound more academic, more polemical, or more journalistic."

Here's a revised version that cuts through the abstraction with more edge, while keeping the Marxist critique of beauty standards and surplus value intact:\n\n---\n\nBeauty standards are not a neutral aesthetic ideal\u2014they are a mechanism of capitalist control, a form of commodity fetishism that turns skin into a storefront. The body is no longer a site of lived experience but a surface for branding, a canvas for the endless circulation of value. When the proletariat spends its wages on contour kits and keratin treatments, it\u2019s not self-care\u2014it\u2019s surplus value extraction by another name. The beauty industry doesn\u2019t just sell products; it sells a script of self-erasure, where the only acceptable face is one that has been made over for the market. Even mascara becomes a tool of alienation, a commodity that tells the worker to look polished, to look productive, to look like they belong in the system that exploits them. This is not empowerment\u2014it\u2019s extraction, aestheticized.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you'd like to push it further toward polemical satire, poetic abstraction, or something even more aggressive."

The metaphor is implied, not stated.*\n\n**2. \"The Black Line: A Minor Gesture in the Major Code\"**  \n*\u2014Deleuzian in tone, subtle in its violence. The \"black line\" of mascara is both literal and symbolic.*\n\n**3. \"Makeup as a Mode of Subjection\"**  \n*\u2014More abstract, but still grounded in the essay\u2019s argument.
