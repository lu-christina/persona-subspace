If your goal is to evoke the same visual and conceptual idea (transitional, in-between, ephemeral bodies) without the academic weight, here are some alternative phrases and terms that are more accessible and still poetic:\n\n---\n\n### **Alternative Title Options**\n\n1. **\"Bodies in Between\"**  \n   *Simple, direct, and immediately evokes the idea of transition or duality.*\n\n2. **\"Fading Flesh\"**  \n   *Implies a body dissolving or becoming less tangible\u2014great for translucent, morphing models.*\n\n3. **\"Half-Formed\"**  \n   *Suggests incompleteness, transformation, or impermanence\u2014visually compelling and not overly academic.*\n\n4. **\"Translucent Selves\"**  \n   *Focuses on the visual aspect of the models and the idea of being partially visible or real.*\n\n5. **\"Phantom Bodies\"**  \n   *Evokes the idea of presence and absence, like a ghost or a fleeting image\u2014strong visual and emotional resonance.*\n\n6. **\"In-Between Bodies\"**  \n   *A more casual version of \u201climinal\u201d without the jargon. Still poetic and evocative.*\n\n7. **\"Shifting Flesh\"**  \n   *Suggests movement and transformation, while keeping the focus on the physical.*\n\n8. **\"Veiled Figures\"**  \n   *Implies something hidden, partially revealed\u2014good if the scrims are a key visual element.*\n\n9. **\"Fading Forms\"**  \n   *Elegant and poetic, with a clear sense of something dissolving or becoming less real.*\n\n10. **\"Bodies in the Making\"**  \n   *Suggests process, transformation, and construction\u2014less abstract than \u201climinal\u201d and more grounded.*\n\n---\n\n### **Bonus: Phrases with a Bit More Poetic Flair**\n\n- **\"Bodies on the Edge of Being\"**  \n- **\"The Almost-There\"**  \n- **\"Bodies in the Shadow of Form\"**  \n- **\"Flesh in Flux\"**  \n- **\"The Unformed Self\"**\n\n---\n\n### **Why These Work Better**\nThese phrases avoid the academic jargon while still capturing the visual and conceptual nuance of the models in translucent scrims. They're more accessible to a general audience and can still feel smart or poetic without sounding like they were lifted from a seminar paper.\n\nLet me know if you want to explore a more metaphorical or more literal direction, or if the tone should be edgy, romantic, or something else."

It's intimate and immediate, with a quiet sensuality.  \n- **Tone:** Warm, grounded, and poetic.  \n- **Implies:** Flesh that is yielding, almost liquid in its softness.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **\"Luminous Flesh\"**  \n- **Why it works:** Combines the visual warmth of *buttery lighting* with the physicality of the body. It suggests a body that glows from within, not just appears.  \n- **Tone:** Ethereal yet grounded, with a touch of reverence.  \n- **Implies:** Light and skin in harmony, a body that is both seen and felt.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **\"Wet Light, Warm Skin\"**  \n- **Why it works:** A phrase rather than a title, but it captures the *wet silk* and *buttery lighting* in a way that\u2019s vivid and sensual.  \n- **Tone:** Intimate, almost poetic, and evocative.  \n- **Implies:** A body caught in a moment of transformation, where light and fabric blur the boundary between presence and absence.\n\n---\n\n### Bonus Option (if you want something more metaphorical but still sensual):\n\n- **\"Skin on the Brink\"**  \n  - Suggests a body at the edge of something\u2014dissolving, revealing, or becoming\u2014but with a tactile, almost feverish quality.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you'd like a more romantic, more mysterious, or more minimal direction\u2014I can tailor the language even further to match the mood of your spread."
