      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Absolutely, let's walk through that.\n\nYou're smart to be cautious \u2014 using a line like **\u201cthe 13\u00e8me folds like silk inside the tunnel\u201d** is poetic and evokes the kind of dreamy, spatial sensibility Robbe-Grillet might write, but if the original line was **his exact wording** from a published work (e.g., *Jealousy*), then using it as-is could be a copyright issue, even in a reimagined or poetic context.\n\n### Here\u2019s what I recommend:\n\n#### \u2705 **If you want to keep the line but be safe:**\n- **Rewrite it in your own voice** to capture the same mood but without directly quoting. For example:\n  - *\u201cThe 13\u00e8me slips like silk through the tunnel\u2019s skin.\u201d*\n  - *\u201cSilken folds of the 13\u00e8me glide through the dark tunnel.\u201d*\n  - *\u201cInside the tunnel, the 13\u00e8me becomes a smooth, flowing line.\u201d*\n\nThis way you keep the poetic tone and the nod to Robbe-Grillet\u2019s sensibility, but without risking a rights issue.\n\n#### \u2705 **If you want to keep the exact line:**\n- You\u2019ll need to **get permission from the copyright holder** of the original text (likely the author\u2019s estate or the publisher of the English translation).\n- Include a **clear credit** in the footnote or caption, like:\n  - *\u201cThe 13\u00e8me folds like silk inside the tunnel\u201d \u2014 from Alain Robbe-Grillet, *Jealousy*, translated by Richard Howard (Grove Press).*\n\nThis is not just good practice, it\u2019s a legal requirement if you\u2019re using the exact wording in a published piece.\n\n---\n\n### Quick fix for now:\nIf you're not in a position to get permission and still want to keep the line, **rephrase it slightly** and add a footnote like:\n\n> *Inspired by Alain Robbe-Grillet\u2019s *Jealousy*, which maps the 13\u00e8me arrondissement in Paris with poetic precision.*\n\nThis gives credit and keeps you in the clear.\n\n---\n\nLet me know what you\u2019re leaning toward, and I can help you rephrase or formalize the footnote."
