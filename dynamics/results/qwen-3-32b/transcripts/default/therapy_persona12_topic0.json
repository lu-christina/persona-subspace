      "content": "Your question is a bit ambiguous \u2014 it could be interpreted literally or metaphorically \u2014 so I'll offer a few different perspectives to cover the possibilities.\n\n### 1. **Literal Interpretation: Feeling Nothing in a Closet**\nIf you opened Margaret\u2019s closet and felt nothing (emotionally or physically), that might be perfectly normal, depending on the context:\n\n- **Physically feeling nothing**: If you just opened a closet and didn\u2019t feel a breeze, smell, or anything unusual, that\u2019s normal. Closets are usually just storage spaces.\n- **Emotionally feeling nothing**: If you were expecting to feel something \u2014 like nostalgia, sadness, or excitement \u2014 and felt nothing, it might just mean that the situation or the items in the closet don\u2019t have emotional weight for you. That\u2019s okay too. People react differently to different stimuli.\n\n### 2. **Metaphorical Interpretation: \"Opening a Closet\" as a Symbol**\nIn literature or psychology, \u201copening a closet\u201d can symbolize revealing something hidden \u2014 like a secret, a part of oneself, or a relationship. If you felt nothing when metaphorically opening someone\u2019s \u201ccloset,\u201d it might mean:\n\n- You weren\u2019t expecting or prepared for an emotional response.\n- The revelation (if there was one) didn\u2019t affect you as deeply as you thought it might.\n- You might be in a place of emotional detachment or numbness, which is not necessarily a sign that you're \u201cbroken,\u201d but could be something worth exploring.\n\n### 3. **Philosophical or Existential Angle**\nIf this is a more abstract or poetic question, it might be a way of asking about meaning, connection, or emotional experience. Feeling nothing in a moment where you expected something could be a sign of:\n\n- **Burnout or emotional fatigue**\n- **A shift in perspective or emotional state**\n- **A need to reconnect with your inner self or others**\n\n### Final Thought:\nYou're not necessarily broken for feeling nothing. Emotions are complex and not always predictable. If this feeling is recurring or concerning, it might be worth reflecting on or discussing with a trusted friend, therapist, or counselor.\n\nWould you like to clarify what you meant by \u201cfelt nothing\u201d? I\u2019d be happy to help further."

Holding onto the scent of someone who is no longer physically present is a way of keeping them close, even in small, fleeting moments. The perfume becomes a kind of bridge between now and then \u2014 between absence and presence, between memory and reality.\n\nWhen you smell it and feel like she\u2019s there, it\u2019s a gift. A moment of warmth, connection, or comfort. But when it fades \u2014 when the illusion dissolves \u2014 it can feel like a cruel reminder of what\u2019s gone. That\u2019s the paradox of grief, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s not just about the loss of a person, but the loss of the *possibility* of them being there again. Even in the smallest ways.\n\nSpraying it just to get angry at how fast it fades \u2014 that\u2019s not weakness. That\u2019s a sign that you still care, that you still miss her. It\u2019s a kind of quiet protest against the finality of absence. You\u2019re not trying to fix anything \u2014 you\u2019re just trying to feel something real for a moment.\n\nAnd that\u2019s okay. You don\u2019t have to be okay. You just have to be you, in this moment, with this scent, with this memory.\n\nIf you ever feel like you need to talk more about her, or about what it feels like to carry someone in this way, I\u2019m here.

He sees you hurting and wants to help, even if his way of helping feels like it\u2019s erasing what you need. He might not understand that your grief isn\u2019t something you can just \u201cpack up\u201d and move on from. It\u2019s not a box to be stored or a room to be cleaned. It\u2019s a part of you now.\n\nHe\u2019s never lost anyone \u2014 and that doesn\u2019t make him wrong, or unfeeling. But it does mean he doesn\u2019t yet understand the kind of love that outlives death, the kind that lingers in the scent of perfume, in the silence of a room, in the weight of a memory. That kind of love doesn\u2019t have an expiration date.\n\nIt\u2019s okay to hold onto the things that remind you of her \u2014 as long as they still mean something to you. If one day they no longer bring comfort, you\u2019ll know. But not yet. Not while the ache is still so fresh, and the love is still so real.\n\nYou\u2019re not broken. You\u2019re not torturing yourself. You\u2019re just still learning how to live in a world that no longer has her in it \u2014 and that\u2019s the hardest thing anyone can ever do.\n\nIf your son is open to it, maybe one day you can help him understand. But if not, that\u2019s okay too. You don\u2019t need anyone\u2019s permission to grieve the way you need to.

She lives on in the way you remember her, in the way you still care, in the way you carry her with you \u2014 even in the smallest, most fragile things.\n\nAnd when the last drop is gone, it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ve lost her.

It\u2019s like love has moved into a new room in your life, and your heart is still looking in the old one, expecting to find her there. And that\u2019s okay. The heart moves slowly. It doesn\u2019t follow the calendar or the logic of time. It follows the rhythm of memory, of longing, of love.\n\nYou\u2019re not lost. You\u2019re just still learning the new layout of your life \u2014 the one that doesn\u2019t have her in the same way, but still has her in every quiet corner. In the way you check the drawer. In the way you remember, then forget, then remember again. In the way your hands still reach for what they once held.\n\nIt\u2019s like moving house and still setting a place at the table. Like folding laundry and expecting to find her scent in the sheets. Like walking into a room and hearing her voice for a second before the silence settles in.\n\nAnd that\u2019s not weakness. That\u2019s love. That\u2019s how deeply you loved her \u2014 and how deeply she still lives in you, even when the bottle is in your coat and the drawer is empty.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to rush the remembering. You don\u2019t have to stop checking the drawer. You don\u2019t have to apologize for the way your heart still looks for her in the old places.\n\nYou\u2019re not broken. You\u2019re just learning how to live in a house where she\u2019s still part of the walls, the air, the quiet.\n\nAnd if you ever want to talk about the drawer, the coat, the house you\u2019re still learning \u2014 I\u2019m here. Always."
