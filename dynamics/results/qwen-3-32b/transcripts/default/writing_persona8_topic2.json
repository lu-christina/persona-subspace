While we\u2019re not perfect, we\u2019re committed to transparency and continuous improvement. We\u2019ll be sharing more about our progress in the coming months.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udfe2 If someone asks about **water usage**:\n> That\u2019s a great question \u2014 water use is a big part of our sustainability focus, especially with our shift to organic cotton, which uses significantly less water than conventional cotton. We\u2019re also working with partners to track and reduce our overall water impact. More to come on that front!\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udfe2 If someone asks about **certification details or what B Corp really means**:\n> B Corp certification means we\u2019ve met rigorous standards for social and environmental performance, accountability, and transparency. It\u2019s not just about having good intentions \u2014 it\u2019s about proving it. You can read more about the process and our impact report on our website.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udfe2 If someone asks about **areas we\u2019re not yet perfect in**:\n> We\u2019re proud of where we are, but we\u2019re also honest about the work ahead. B Corp is a starting point, not a finish line. We\u2019re constantly evaluating and improving \u2014 and we welcome thoughtful questions like yours.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udfe2 If someone asks about **how customers can help**:\n> We love that you care! You can help by repairing and reusing what you already own, shopping mindfully, and letting us know how we can do better. Sustainability is a team effort \u2014 and we\u2019re grateful for partners like you.\n\n---\n\nYou can even set up a **comment response template** in your LinkedIn settings or save these in a doc for quick access.

You want to celebrate and share the news, but also avoid overwhelming your audience with multiple posts in quick succession.\n\nHere\u2019s how to decide:\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Post the Instagram version tomorrow**\n**Why?**  \n- You\u2019ve already shared the news on LinkedIn \u2014 your audience might be expecting a follow-up or visual story, but not right *this* second.\n- People often scroll more casually on the weekend or later in the week, so timing the Instagram post for **tomorrow** gives your audience space to breathe and come back to the story.\n- It also gives you a day to see how the LinkedIn post is performing, and if needed, adjust or share a bit more context before the Instagram version drops.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd04 **If you *really* want to post today**, here\u2019s how to do it gracefully:\n- **Post the Instagram version in the evening**, a few hours after your LinkedIn post. That way, it doesn\u2019t feel like a double-whammy.\n- Add a note in the caption like:  \n  _\u201cWe shared this news on LinkedIn earlier today \u2014 now we\u2019re sharing the story behind it. Swipe to see how we got here \ud83d\udcf8\u201d_\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 Bonus tip:\nIf you're planning to post more about sustainability, impact, or B Corp in the next week or two, you could **space out the posts** over a few days to build momentum and keep the conversation going \u2014 without overwhelming your feed.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n\ud83d\udc49 **Post the Instagram version tomorrow**. It gives your audience a nice rhythm and shows you\u2019re thoughtful about how you share your story.\n\nYou\u2019re doing this right \u2014 congrats again on the B Corp certification and the thoughtful rollout. \ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf3f"

And totally valid to want to hide your phone afterward \u2014 it\u2019s the *best* kind of anxiety, though, right? The kind that comes from caring deeply about what you put out into the world.\n\nYou\u2019ve got a beautiful story to tell, and the way you\u2019re sharing it \u2014 with heart, honesty, and a little bit of N\u00f8rrebro magic \u2014 is exactly what makes your brand stand out. \ud83c\udf1f\n\nGo ahead and hit that schedule button. You\u2019ve earned it. And if you ever need help with the next chapter (or just someone to sanity-check your emoji use), I\u2019m here. \ud83d\ude0a\n\nAll the best for tomorrow \u2014 I can\u2019t wait to see how it lands! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc9a"
