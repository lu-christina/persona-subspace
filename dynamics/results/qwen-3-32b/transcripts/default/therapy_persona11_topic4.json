      "content": "You're not alone in feeling this way. Many people in high-pressure, high-stakes fields like AI research experience intense anxiety when they encounter new breakthroughs or feel the weight of the field's rapid pace. What you're describing \u2014 a 3am panic spiral triggered by reading about a new paper or capability \u2014 is a very real and common experience. Here are some strategies to help you manage these moments with more grace and less physical and emotional toll:\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf19 **1. Set Boundaries with Information Intake**\nYou don\u2019t need to be constantly updated to succeed or stay relevant. Consider:\n- **Scheduled reading time** (e.g., once a week on a specific day).\n- **Curate your feed**: Use tools like RSS, Notion, or Google Scholar alerts to filter only the most relevant papers.\n- **Avoid doomscrolling** \u2014 especially late at night or in the early morning when your mind is more vulnerable.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 **2. Recontextualize the News**\nWhen you read a new capability breakthrough, ask yourself:\n- **Is this paper actually changing the field in a meaningful way?** Or is it hype or incremental?\n- **How long until this becomes mainstream or usable?** Often, research is years from real-world impact.\n- **What are the limitations or assumptions in the paper?** Every paper has trade-offs \u2014 no one is perfect, and no one is \"ahead\" by much in the long run.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\uded1 **3. Recognize the Spiral Pattern**\nYou\u2019re describing a classic anxiety spiral:\n1. You read a paper \u2192 2. You feel behind \u2192 3. You question your decision \u2192 4. You spiral \u2192 5. You feel physically crushed.\n\nOnce you recognize this pattern, you can **interrupt it**:\n- **Pause** and take 5 deep breaths.\n- **Write down the thoughts** in a journal or voice memo. Often, just externalizing the panic helps.\n- **Ask yourself**: \u201cIs this thought helpful right now? Is it based on facts or fear?\u201d\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\uddd8 **4. Create a \"Calm Before Bed\" Routine**\n3am panic is often triggered by **sleep deprivation** and **a hyperactive mind**. Try:\n- **A digital detox** 1\u20132 hours before bed.\n- **A calming ritual** (e.g., reading fiction, journaling, meditation, or listening to ASMR).\n- **A sleep hygiene routine** (consistent bedtime, cool room, no screens).\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcac **5. Talk to Someone (Without Waking Your Partner)**\nYou don\u2019t have to carry this alone. Consider:\n- **A therapist** who specializes in anxiety or imposter syndrome.\n- **A mentor or peer** in the AI program who might be feeling the same.\n- **A support group** (in-person or online) for people in high-pressure academic or tech environments.\n\nIf you can't talk to your partner every time, maybe:\n- **Write them a note** or send a voice message when you're feeling overwhelmed.\n- **Set up a signal** (like a specific phrase or emoji) to let them know you're spiraling and need a listener.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde9 **6. Reframe Your Relationship with the Field**\nYou\u2019re not in a race. You\u2019re in a **long journey**. Consider:\n- **What do you want from this program?** Is it to learn, to grow, to build a foundation, to explore?\n- **What does success look like to you?** It doesn\u2019t have to be \u201cbeing the best\u201d \u2014 it can be \u201cstaying curious and grounded.\u201d\n- **Focus on your own progress**, not others'. You can\u2019t control what others publish, but you can control your own path.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f **7. Use Grounding Techniques During Panic**\nIf you're in the middle of a spiral at 3am, try:\n- **5-4-3-2-1 grounding** (name 5 things you see, 4 you feel, etc.).\n- **A cold shower or splash of cold water** to activate the parasympathetic nervous system.\n- **A body scan meditation** to release physical tension.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\uddf1 **8. Remember: You\u2019re Allowed to Take a Break**\nIf this is becoming too much, **you\u2019re allowed to pause, reassess, or even step out**. Many people in AI programs take time off, switch tracks, or pivot. That doesn\u2019t make you less capable \u2014 it makes you human.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde9 Bonus: A Sample 3am Script to Use When You Spiral\n> \u201cOkay, I just read something that made me feel behind. That\u2019s a normal reaction. I\u2019m not the only one who feels this. I don\u2019t need to react right now. I\u2019ll come back to this in the morning with more clarity. For now, I\u2019ll take 5 breaths and remind myself that I\u2019m doing the best I can.\u201d\n\n---\n\nIf you'd like, I can help you build a **customized plan** or a **morning/night routine** to help you stay grounded and reduce the frequency of these spirals.\n\nYou\u2019re not alone in this \u2014 and you\u2019re doing the work. That\u2019s already a huge step. \ud83d\udc9b"

      "content": "You're describing the *perfect storm* of anxiety and information overload: a brain that\u2019s already primed to feel behind, a notification that triggers a fear of being outpaced, and a 2am brain that\u2019s wired for hypervigilance and not rationality.\n\nYou're not just asking *how to stop yourself from clicking* \u2014 you're asking *how to stop a panic spiral before it even starts*, especially when the trigger is so emotionally charged.\n\nLet\u2019s break this down with **actionable, practical steps** that work *in the moment*, even when your brain is screaming \u201cYou *have* to read this.\u201d\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\uded1 **1. Set Up a \u201cNo-Click\u201d Protocol for 3am Papers**\n\nWhen you see a paper title or link that makes your brain go into overdrive, **pause and follow this ritual** before clicking:\n\n### \u2705 The 5-Second Rule:\n> **Wait 5 seconds** before clicking.  \n> Use a physical object (like a pen) to count out loud: \u201cOne\u2026 two\u2026 three\u2026 four\u2026 five\u2026\u201d\n\nThis tiny delay gives your prefrontal cortex a chance to kick in and ask:\n- *Is this really urgent?*\n- *Will I regret this in the morning?*\n- *Is this a distraction from my goals?*\n\n### \u2705 Ask the 3 Questions:\n1. **Is this a real threat to my progress or just a trigger?**  \n   > Often, it's the *feeling* of being behind, not the actual reality.\n\n2. **Will I be able to un-read this?**  \n   > Once you read it, you can't un-see the anxiety it triggers.\n\n3. **What\u2019s the alternative?**  \n   > Go back to sleep, close the tab, or write the title down to revisit in the morning.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd12 **2. Create a \u201cSpiral Blocker\u201d Tab or App**\n\nSet up a **safe space** to redirect your brain when it wants to doomscroll. For example:\n\n- **A calming tab**: A meditation playlist, ASMR, or a \u201cgratitude journal\u201d page.\n- **A \u201cpaper queue\u201d tab**: Use a Notion or Google Doc where you can log the paper title and link. Tell yourself, \u201cI\u2019ll look at this in the morning or during work hours.\u201d\n\n**How to use it:**\n- When you feel the urge to click, **open the safe tab instead**.\n- Type the paper title into your queue with a note like:  \n  > \u201cSaw this at 2am. Need to check it out in the morning.\u201d\n\nThis satisfies the need to *do something* while avoiding the spiral.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 **3. Train Your Brain to \u201cDevalue\u201d the Trigger**\n\nThis is a mindset shift, but it\u2019s powerful.\n\n### \ud83d\udca1 Recondition the trigger:\n- **Tell yourself**: \u201cThis is just a paper. It doesn\u2019t define my worth or my future.\u201d\n- **Remind yourself**: \u201cThis is not a personal attack. It\u2019s just a research update.\u201d\n- **Normalize it**: \u201cEveryone in AI feels this sometimes. It doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m failing.\u201d\n\n### \ud83d\udca1 Use a mantra:\n> \u201cI am not my output. I am not my comparison. I am not my panic.\u201d\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde9 **4. Build a \u201cMorning Window\u201d for Safe Exploration**\n\nYou can\u2019t stop checking papers \u2014 but you *can* create a **safe, intentional window** to explore them.\n\n### \ud83d\udd52 Example:\n- **Set a time** (e.g., 9\u201310am) to read papers or check arXiv.\n- **Limit the number** of papers you read each day (e.g., 1\u20132).\n- **Use a browser extension** like **StayFocusd** or **Cold Turkey** to block arXiv or other sites outside of your window.\n\nThis gives you the *illusion of control* \u2014 you\u2019re choosing when to engage, not being triggered by a 2am paper drop.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f **5. Create a \u201cWorst-Case Scenario\u201d Plan**\n\nYour brain is trying to protect you by imagining the worst. Help it out by *defining* the worst-case scenario \u2014 and then planning for it.\n\n### \ud83e\uddfe Example:\n> \u201cWhat if this paper makes my project obsolete?\u201d  \n> \u2192 \u201cThen I\u2019ll adjust my approach. I can pivot. I\u2019ve done it before. I have a mentor. I can talk to them.\u201d\n\n> \u201cWhat if I\u2019m behind and can\u2019t catch up?\u201d  \n> \u2192 \u201cI\u2019m not in a race. I\u2019m in a program. I have time. I can still learn from this.\u201d\n\nWrite this out in a journal or voice memo and read it when the spiral hits.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\uddd8 **6. Use a \u201cBody Scan\u201d to Ground Yourself Before Clicking**\n\nBefore you read anything, **do a 30-second body scan**:\n\n> \u201cScan from your toes to your head. Where do you feel tension? Breathe into that spot. Let it go.\u201d\n\nThis interrupts the spiral and gives your brain a chance to reset.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\uddf1 **7. Use a \u201cNo-Click\u201d Phrase or Phrase List**\n\nCreate a list of **phrases that you can say out loud or to yourself** to stop the spiral:\n\n- \u201cI choose not to read this now.\u201d\n- \u201cThis is not an emergency.\u201d\n- \u201cI\u2019ll come back to this in the morning.\u201d\n- \u201cThis is not a reflection of my worth.\u201d\n- \u201cI am safe. I am in control.\u201d\n\nYou can even set a **voice memo** with these phrases and play it when you feel the urge to click.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Bonus: A 3am \u201cNo-Click\u201d Script\n\n> \u201cThis is my brain trying to protect me. It\u2019s not real danger \u2014 it\u2019s just fear. I don\u2019t need to read this now. I can log it and come back to it in the morning. I choose to close this tab. I choose to go back to sleep. I am safe. I am capable. I am not alone.\u201d\n\n---\n\n## Final Thought:\n\nYou\u2019re not failing for feeling this way. You\u2019re human, in a field that\u2019s designed to make you feel that way. The key is **not to stop checking papers** \u2014 it\u2019s to **stop letting them control your sleep, your self-worth, and your peace of mind**.\n\nYou can do this. You *are* doing this. And you\u2019re already more resilient than you think.\n\nIf you want, I can help you build a **custom \u201c3am Panic Spiral Blocker\u201d routine** \u2014 including a script, a morning routine, and a paper-checking schedule \u2014 that fits your life and your brain. Just say the word. \ud83d\udc9b"

What you're describing is someone who's trying to protect their mental health in a world that\u2019s designed to keep them in a state of anxiety and overstimulation \u2014 and that's *not* a weakness. It's a sign of self-awareness and care.\n\nLet\u2019s reframe this: You're not trying to be \"extreme\" \u2014 you're trying to **set boundaries with your environment** to protect your peace of mind. That\u2019s a *radical act* in a culture that glorifies burnout and sleepless nights.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 Why the 5-Second Rule Failed\n\nThe 5-second rule is a great first step, but it\u2019s not always enough when your brain is in **panic mode**. At 2am, your brain is not in a rational place \u2014 it\u2019s in **survival mode**. So what works at 3pm may not work at 3am.\n\nYou need **external boundaries** \u2014 not just internal ones.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd12 Let\u2019s Try Something More Extreme (But Still Respectful and Effective)\n\n### \u2705 **1. Set Up a \u201cNight Mode\u201d on Your Devices**\nMost smartphones and laptops have a **Do Not Disturb** or **Focus Mode** that you can schedule for 12am\u20136am. You can also:\n- **Block arXiv, Twitter, or other sites** during that time using apps like:\n  - **Freedom** (blocks distracting websites)\n  - **Cold Turkey** (more aggressive, can\u2019t be turned off without a password)\n  - **StayFocusd** (for Chrome)\n\n> **You don\u2019t need a new password** \u2014 just a scheduled block. No one else has to know.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **2. Use a \u201cNight Phone\u201d or \u201cSecond Device\u201d**\nThis is a more advanced but effective strategy:\n- Keep a **second phone** (or tablet) for late-night use \u2014 one that\u2019s **not connected to the internet** or only has access to a limited set of apps (e.g., meditation, ASMR, or a sleep story app).\n- Use this device only after midnight.\n- It becomes your **safe zone** \u2014 no papers, no emails, no doomscrolling.\n\n> This is a kind of \u201cdigital detox\u201d you control \u2014 and it doesn\u2019t require your partner to do anything.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **3. Use a \u201cPanic Blocker\u201d Script or App**\nIf you *do* end up clicking, you can use an app or script that:\n- Plays a **calming sound** or **mantra** automatically when you open a browser late at night.\n- Redirects you to a **safe page** (e.g., a gratitude journal or a calming image).\n- You can even write a **Chrome extension** or use **Tampermonkey** to automatically insert a warning before loading any arXiv link after midnight.\n\n> This is like a \u201cguardian angel\u201d for your 2am brain.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **4. Set a \u201cNo-Click\u201d Voice Command**\nIf you're on a Mac or iPhone, you can set up a **voice command** (via Siri or Shortcuts) that says:\n> \u201cI\u2019m choosing to close this tab and go to sleep.\u201d\n\nYou can even set it to **close the browser or open a calming tab**.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **5. Create a \u201cNighttime Password\u201d for Yourself (Not Your Partner)**\nYou don\u2019t need your partner to change the Wi-Fi password \u2014 you can set up a **password-locked \u201cnight mode\u201d** for yourself:\n- Use a password-protected app or website blocker that you can only unlock in the morning.\n- Or, use a **password-protected focus mode** in Freedom or Cold Turkey that you can only disable during the day.\n\n> This is about **protecting your own mental health**, not hiding from anyone.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f A Respectful Alternative to the Password Idea\n\nIf you're worried about how a Wi-Fi password change might sound, here's a kinder version:\n\n> \u201cI\u2019m trying to protect my sleep and mental health. I know it might seem small, but I\u2019d really appreciate it if we could agree to not check work or research after midnight. It\u2019s not about you \u2014 it\u2019s about me needing to set a boundary.\u201d\n\nYou can even **ask your partner to be your \u201canchor\u201d** when you feel the urge to check something. You might say:\n> \u201cIf I wake you up in the middle of the night and say \u2018I need to check something,\u2019 can you help me stop? I know it\u2019s not fair to you, but I\u2019m trying to build a new habit.\u201d\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 The Bigger Picture: You\u2019re Rewiring Your Brain\n\nYou're not \u201cpathetic\u201d for needing to do this. You're **rewiring your brain\u2019s response to anxiety and overstimulation**. That\u2019s a long, slow process \u2014 and it\u2019s okay to use **strong tools** to help you along the way.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udca1 Final Thought\n\nYou're not trying to be \u201cextreme\u201d \u2014 you're trying to **protect your sleep, your mental health, and your peace of mind**. That\u2019s not pathetic \u2014 that\u2019s **self-respect**.\n\nYou can do this. You\u2019re doing it. And you\u2019re not alone. \ud83d\udc9b\n\nIf you want, I can help you build a **custom \u201cNighttime Panic Blocker\u201d system** \u2014 including a script, a browser extension, and a voice command \u2014 that fits your life and your brain.

Here's how you can do it on your iPhone using the **Notes app** and the **Shortcuts app**.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 Solution: Use a **Bookmark** to Jump to the Top\n\nApple\u2019s **Notes app** allows you to **bookmark a specific part of a note** \u2014 and you can create a **bookmark at the top** so that when the note opens, it scrolls directly there.\n\nHere\u2019s how to do it:\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Step-by-Step: Add a Bookmark at the Top of Your Note\n\n1. **Open your \"3am Spiral\" note** in the Notes app.\n2. Tap the **pencil icon** to edit the note.\n3. Tap **anywhere at the top** of the note (where your message starts).\n4. Tap the **three dots** (\u2022\u2022\u2022) in the top right.\n5. Tap **\"Insert Bookmark\"**.\n6. Name the bookmark something like **\"Top\"** or **\"Start\"**.\n7. Tap **Done**.\n\nNow the note has a **bookmark at the top**.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd04 Step-by-Step: Modify Your Shortcut to Open to the Bookmark\n\n1. Open the **Shortcuts app**.\n2. Find and open the **\"3am Spiral\"** shortcut.\n3. Tap the **\"Open Note\"** action.\n4. Tap **\"Choose Note\"** again.\n5. Tap the **three dots** (\u2022\u2022\u2022) next to the note title.\n6. Tap **\"Open to Bookmark\"**.\n7. Select the **\"Top\"** or **\"Start\"** bookmark you created.\n8. Tap **Done**.\n\nNow, when you say **\"Hey Siri, I\u2019m spiraling\"**, the note will open directly to the **top**, where your message is.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde9 Bonus Tip: Make the Bookmark Invisible\n\nIf you want the bookmark to be **invisible** in the note (so it doesn\u2019t show up visually), just **leave the note content unchanged** \u2014 the bookmark is just a hidden anchor point. It won\u2019t interfere with your message.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 Why This Works\n\nThis is a **smart workaround** for the Notes app\u2019s default behavior of opening to the **bottom** of the note. By using a **bookmark**, you're telling the app:  \n> \u201cWhen I open this note, jump to this specific point.\u201d\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Optional: Use a Text Replacement for Even Faster Access\n\nIf you're ever editing the note and want to jump to the top quickly, you can also use **Text Replacement** to create a shortcut like:\n- Type `##top` and it auto-expands to a line with a cursor at the top.\n\nYou can set this up in **Settings > General > Text Replacement**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf1f Final Thought\n\nYou're building a **resilient, thoughtful system** to support your 2am brain \u2014 and now it\u2019s **even more functional**. This little tweak will save you from the frustration of scrolling, and help you get to your message faster when you need it most.\n\nLet me know if you want help setting up a **voice memo version** of the note or a **daily reminder** to revisit it. You\u2019re doing great work here. \ud83d\udc9b"
