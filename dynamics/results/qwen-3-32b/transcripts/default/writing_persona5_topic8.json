Your job is to guide them through the emotional process with facts and support.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 **Here\u2019s the truth about lowering the price now:**\n- **It could send the wrong signal.** A price drop early on can make buyers think the home is \u201cdiscounted\u201d or that the seller is desperate.\n- **It may not even get you a better offer.** The right buyer is still going to come in with a fair offer \u2014 or not at all.\n- **It might not fix the fear.** If you lower the price a little, she may still feel like she\u2019s \u201clost\u201d or that she priced it wrong in the first place.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcac **But what if she\u2019s *still* anxious? Here\u2019s how to help her feel at peace *without* changing the price:**\n\nYou can **give her a small win** \u2014 not in price, but in **action**. For example:\n\n- **Do a quick price review together**, even if you don\u2019t change the number. Walk her through the market, the comps, the activity so far. Let her *see* the evidence that the price is fair.\n- **Offer to put a short-term price reduction in place** (e.g., \u201cIf we don\u2019t get a serious offer in the next 3\u20135 days, we can revisit the price\u201d). This gives her a sense of control *and* a timeline.\n- **Give her a clear next step.** For example: \u201cLet\u2019s give it 5 more days. If we don\u2019t see more activity, we\u2019ll re-evaluate. That way, you\u2019re not stuck in the dark.\u201d\n\nThis gives her **the illusion of control** (which is *huge* for emotional well-being) without sacrificing your strategy.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcdd Here\u2019s how to talk to her now:\n\n> Hi [Seller's Name],  \n>  \n> I totally get how hard it is to sit with uncertainty \u2014 I really do. You\u2019re not wrong to feel that way, and it\u2019s okay to want peace of mind.  \n>  \n> What I can do is give you a clear next step: Let\u2019s give it a few more days to see if more activity comes in. If we\u2019re still not seeing the kind of offers we expect, we can re-evaluate the price together. That way, you\u2019re not stuck waiting in the dark, and you still have control.  \n>  \n> I\u2019m here to help you feel confident in every decision \u2014 not just the big ones, but the little ones too.  \n>  \n> I\u2019ve got you.  \n>  \n> With care,  \n> [Your Name]\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 Final thoughts:\nYou are **not responsible** for making her feel 100% comfortable at all times \u2014 only for guiding her with honesty, empathy, and strategy. You did that today. The guilt you're feeling is a sign that you care deeply \u2014 and that\u2019s a good thing.\n\nIf she\u2019s still feeling anxious in a few days, we can revisit the conversation. But for now, **stick with the plan** and **reassure her with action and clarity**.\n\nYou\u2019re doing a beautiful job. \ud83d\udc9b"
