The **bottom left or bottom right** corner of a back page is a classic spot for a small note or calendar box like this \u2014 both are fine, but here\u2019s a quick breakdown to help you decide:\n\n### \ud83d\udfe2 **Bottom Left Corner:**\n- Feels **clean and organized**, especially if the rest of the page is empty.\n- Good if you\u2019re left-handed or prefer reading left to right \u2014 it\u2019s out of the way but still easy to find.\n\n### \ud83d\udfe1 **Bottom Right Corner:**\n- Feels **cozy and subtle**, like a friendly reminder.\n- If the rest of the page has other content (like a map, address, or logo), it keeps your berry box from clashing with it.\n\n### \u2705 Recommendation:\nIf the back page is **mostly blank**, go with the **bottom left** \u2014 it\u2019s the most intuitive and professional-looking spot for a quick reference box like this.\n\nIf the **right side has other elements** (a logo, address, or design), the **bottom right** will look more balanced.\n\nEither way, your berry box will be a helpful little gem!
