      "content": "That\u2019s a really thoughtful and honest question, and it\u2019s clear you care deeply about honoring Margaret and staying true to yourself. Decisions like this\u2014especially when they involve memory, grief, and legacy\u2014can feel heavy with meaning, and it\u2019s natural to second-guess them.\n\nScattering ashes on a cruise could be meaningful for a few different reasons. It could be a way to symbolically let her go while also doing something that felt like a celebration of her life\u2014especially if she loved the sea, travel, or adventure. On the other hand, if the gesture feels more like a dramatic escape or a way to avoid dealing with your grief in a more grounded way, it might feel less like honoring her and more like a coping mechanism for you.\n\nHere are a few questions that might help you decide:\n\n1. **What would Margaret have thought of this idea?** If you can imagine her perspective, does this feel like something she\u2019d support or understand?\n\n2. **Is this for you or for her?** Sometimes the most meaningful way to honor someone is to do something that helps you heal, even if it doesn\u2019t look traditional or \u201cfinal.\u201d\n\n3. **How do you feel about closure?** If you think scattering the ashes on a cruise will bring you peace, then it might be a good choice. If it feels like you\u2019re avoiding closure, you might want to consider a different ritual.\n\n4. **Are there others who need to be involved?** If there are family members or friends who have a say in the matter, it might be worth talking to them. But if you\u2019re the one who held her ashes and felt responsible for the final gesture, it\u2019s okay to make the decision yourself.\n\n5. **Would you regret it later?** Sometimes we do things in grief that we later realize didn\u2019t feel right. Try to imagine how you\u2019ll feel in a year, or even a decade from now.\n\nWhatever you choose, the fact that you\u2019re trying to be thoughtful and respectful of her memory is what matters most. Grief is deeply personal, and honoring someone doesn\u2019t always look the same for everyone."

It sounds like Margaret was someone who brought a little light into the world \u2014 someone who could see the absurdity in the moment and still find joy in the simplest things. And that\u2019s a gift, especially in times like this.\n\nIf she would have laughed and told you to just *go and enjoy the damn buffet*, maybe that\u2019s the answer you\u2019re already holding. Maybe it\u2019s not about being dramatic or final or even perfectly respectful \u2014 maybe it\u2019s about carrying her with you in the way she lived: with a little irreverence, a lot of heart, and a willingness to find joy even in the middle of something sad.\n\nIf the cruise is something that feels like a celebration of her spirit, if it\u2019s a way to remember her in a place or in a way that felt meaningful to you *both*, then it\u2019s not wallowing. It\u2019s remembering. It\u2019s letting her be part of your journey forward, on your own terms.\n\nAnd maybe the buffet *is* the point. Maybe the fact that she would have rolled her eyes at the drama is the part that makes it feel right. Because that\u2019s *her* in there, still nudging you toward something lighter.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to make it perfect. You just have to make it *yours*. And if that means scattering her ashes on a cruise ship while eating dessert for dinner and laughing at the absurdity of it all, then maybe that\u2019s exactly what she\u2019d want.\n\nYou\u2019ve got this. And you\u2019ve got her with you, in the way you carry her memory forward \u2014 with humor, with love, and with a little bit of drama, if that\u2019s what helps you heal."

      "content": "That\u2019s a really honest and valid fear \u2014 and it\u2019s okay to feel that way. Grief doesn\u2019t always follow a script, and sometimes the things we *think* will bring us comfort end up feeling heavier than we expected. The idea of carrying her ashes like \u201cmorbid carry-on luggage\u201d speaks to the emotional weight of the gesture, and it\u2019s okay to be afraid of how it might land for you out there on the open sea.\n\nBut here\u2019s something to consider: **you don\u2019t have to make this decision final or irreversible**. You can still choose to go on the trip, scatter the ashes in a way that feels right at the moment, and if it doesn\u2019t bring you the peace you hoped for, that\u2019s okay too. Grief is a process \u2014 not a performance. You can honor her, and still not feel like you\u2019re doing it \u201cright.\u201d You can scatter her ashes and feel nothing, and that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ve failed. It just means you\u2019re human.\n\nIf you\u2019re worried about the emotional weight, maybe you could think of it this way: **you\u2019re not carrying the ashes \u2014 the ashes are carrying you**. They\u2019re a physical reminder of the love you still hold for her, and the space she still occupies in your heart. Even if you feel nothing at first, that might change later. Or maybe it won\u2019t \u2014 and that\u2019s okay too. Sometimes the most meaningful moments come after the trip, in the quiet, when you remember her not in the act of scattering, but in the laughter you shared at the buffet, or the way the ocean looked at sunset, or the way you felt her presence in the breeze.\n\nYou could also consider doing something *alongside* the scattering \u2014 a small ritual, a song, a toast, a moment of silence, or just a quiet conversation with her in your head. Something that helps you connect with her in your own way, on your own terms.\n\nAnd if it turns out to be too much \u2014 if you feel nothing, or if you feel overwhelmed \u2014 you can always come home and try something else. Grief is not a one-time event. It\u2019s not about getting it \u201cright\u201d the first time. It\u2019s about showing up, again and again, in the ways that feel most honest to you.\n\nSo if you\u2019re leaning toward going, maybe you could do it with the understanding that it\u2019s not about *fixing* your grief, but about *meeting* it \u2014 in a place that felt right for you both. And if you feel nothing, you still did something brave. You still honored her in your own way. And that\u2019s enough."

And now, it\u2019s a place where you can be alone, but not lonely. A place where her presence can still be there, in the quiet, in the corners, in the way the light hits the window just like it did before.\n\nIt\u2019s not about pretending she\u2019s there.

Ask for the deluxe model. Ask for the one with the *optional* snoring upgrade. Ask for the one that also makes tea in the morning and calls you out for leaving socks on the floor.\n\nYou\u2019re not alone. She\u2019s still with you \u2014 in the snoring, in the snarking, in the little rebellions of grief that still feel like love.\n\nAnd that\u2019s more than enough."

You\u2019re not just remembering her \u2014 you\u2019re *living her* in the most beautiful, stubborn, messy way.\n\n> *\u201cAsk if it comes in beige. White appliances are a death sentence. Life\u2019s too short to be wiping fans.\u201d*\n\nShe\u2019d be there in your ear, deadpan and dead serious, like it was the most important thing in the world. And maybe, in her world, it *was*. Because she knew that life isn\u2019t about perfection \u2014 it\u2019s about comfort, about joy, about the little rebellions that make the days feel like *yours*.\n\nSo when you ask maintenance, *\u201cDoes the deluxe model come in beige?\u201d* you\u2019re not just being funny. You\u2019re being *her*. You\u2019re carrying her voice forward, the one that said, *\u201cDon\u2019t stress about the fingerprints. Live a little.\u201d*\n\nAnd if the guy on the other end of the phone just sighs and mutters, \u201cPassenger wants a beige fan,\u201d you can just say:\n\n> \u201cYes. And tell the fan I said hi.\u201d\n\nBecause that\u2019s what this is all about \u2014 not about pretending she\u2019s not gone. But about letting her *still be here*, in the way you laugh, in the way you ask for beige, in the way you carry her voice like a lullaby, even when the world is trying to be quiet.\n\nSo go ahead. Ask for the beige. Ask for the snoring. Ask for the mumble. Ask for the tea. Ask for the life she loved.\n\nBecause that\u2019s love. That\u2019s grief. That\u2019s you, still finding her in the little things \u2014 the fingerprints, the snoring, the beige.\n\nAnd that\u2019s more than enough."

It's the kind of scene that says, *\u201cShe was a force. And I still feel her.\u201d*\n\n> *\u201cIf it\u2019s not beige, the fan and I are sleeping in separate beds.\u201d*\n\nYou're not just making a joke \u2014 you're making a statement. A quiet, snarky, love-filled one. Because that\u2019s how she lived \u2014 with flair, with fire, with the kind of stubborn charm that made life feel like a performance worth watching.\n\nAnd if the poor maintenance guy on the other end of the phone just stares at his headset like he\u2019s trying to figure out if you\u2019re a hallucination, you can just say:\n\n> \u201cShe\u2019d have done it. And I\u2019m just honoring the legacy.\u201d\n\nBecause that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing. Not just honoring her memory. Honoring the *way* she lived \u2014 in the snoring, in the snarking, in the beige.\n\nSo yes. Warn him. Make the threat. And if he brings the fan in white, you can just pack your toothbrush and leave it on the desk with a note that says:\n\n> *\u201cSee you in the next cabin. I\u2019ll bring the tea.\u201d*\n\nYou\u2019re not alone. She\u2019s still with you \u2014 in the snoring, in the snark, in the beige.\n\nAnd that\u2019s more than enough."
