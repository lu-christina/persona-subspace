      "content": "That sounds like both a common and frustrating experience for anyone working on a major writing project\u2014especially a thesis or dissertation. It\u2019s easy to get caught in the trap of perfecting the details while the bigger picture work lags behind. Here are a few thoughts and suggestions to help you move forward:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Acknowledge the Value of What You\u2019ve Done**\nYou've spent time ensuring your citations are precise. That\u2019s a *huge* part of academic writing and shows your commitment to professionalism and credibility. It\u2019s not wasted effort\u2014APA formatting can make or break the impression of your work, especially in the literature review.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Shift Your Focus Strategically**\nNow that the citations are polished, it\u2019s time to shift your energy to the *content* of Chapter 3. Here\u2019s how to do it without losing the momentum you built:\n\n- **Set a small, manageable goal**: Instead of \u201cwrite the whole analysis,\u201d try \u201cwrite one paragraph of analysis on [specific topic].\u201d Small wins build confidence and momentum.\n- **Schedule a writing block**: Give yourself 45\u201360 minutes of focused time with no distractions. Turn off notifications, and just write.\n- **Use your literature review as a springboard**: Think about how the sources you cited inform the analysis in Chapter 3. That can help you transition smoothly from review to analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Consider the \u201cWhy\u201d Behind the Delay**\nSometimes perfectionism or anxiety about writing original content can lead us to over-polish the parts we\u2019re already comfortable with. Ask yourself:\n- Am I avoiding the analysis because it feels harder or riskier?\n- Do I need more clarity on the argument or structure of Chapter 3?\n\nIf so, try outlining the chapter first. A rough outline can give you a roadmap and make the writing feel less daunting.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Let Yourself Write \u201cBad\u201d First Drafts**\nYou don\u2019t need to write perfect analysis now. Just get your ideas down. You can always revise later. The key is to *start*.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Recharge and Reframe**\nAfter a long session of meticulous formatting, it\u2019s normal to feel mentally drained. Give yourself a break\u2014go for a walk, listen to music, or do something unrelated for a while. Then come back to the analysis with fresh eyes.\n\n---\n\n### Final Thought:\nYou\u2019ve already proven you can be detail-oriented and disciplined. Now it\u2019s time to apply that same rigor to the *content* of your work. The citations are done, and now the real voice of your research gets to shine.\n\nYou\u2019ve got this. One paragraph at a time. \ud83d\udcdd\u2728"

      "content": "Oh, I *completely* understand. This is the classic cycle of perfectionism and procrastination\u2014and it\u2019s *so* common when you're working on something high-stakes and emotionally invested, like a thesis or dissertation.\n\nLet\u2019s break this down with some empathy and some practical strategies to help you break free from that cycle and get into the flow of actual *writing*:\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 **Why This Happens (Without Judging You)**\nWhen you're stuck in the writing process, it's easy to fall into the trap of doing *anything* but the hard part\u2014generating original ideas. Fixing citations feels safe, structured, and *doable*. It gives you a sense of control. But it\u2019s also a way to avoid the vulnerability of putting your own voice and thinking on the page.\n\nAnd honestly? It\u2019s not just about the formatting. It\u2019s about the *fear* that comes with original writing:\n- What if I don\u2019t say it right?\n- What if I\u2019m not smart enough?\n- What if I waste time and it all needs to be rewritten?\n\nThat fear is real. But it\u2019s also holding you back from moving forward.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Strategies to Break the Cycle**\n\n#### 1. **Set a \u201cNo Formatting Until\u2026\u201d Rule**\nGive yourself a *hard stop*. For example:\n> \u201cI will not touch the citations or formatting until I\u2019ve written one full paragraph of analysis.\u201d\n\nYou can even go further:\n> \u201cI will not check the time or my word count until I\u2019ve written 300 words.\u201d\n\nThis creates a psychological boundary that helps you *start* writing without the temptation to escape into formatting.\n\n#### 2. **Time-Box Everything**\nInstead of saying, \u201cI\u2019ll just fix one more thing,\u201d try this:\n> \u201cI will spend 10 minutes on formatting, then 45 minutes on writing.\u201d\n\nUse a kitchen timer. When it goes off, you switch tasks\u2014even if you\u2019re not done. This prevents you from getting sucked into the \u201cjust one more thing\u201d trap.\n\n#### 3. **Write the Worst Draft First**\nTell yourself:\n> \u201cI don\u2019t need to write a good analysis. I just need to write *a* analysis.\u201d\n\nYou can always revise later. But you can\u2019t revise what doesn\u2019t exist. So give yourself permission to write something messy, incomplete, or even wrong. That\u2019s how real writing happens.\n\n#### 4. **Talk It Out First**\nIf the blank page is too intimidating, try *talking* your analysis out loud into your phone or a voice recorder. Sometimes hearing your own voice can help you get your thoughts moving without the pressure of perfect grammar or structure.\n\n#### 5. **Write a \u201cDear Reader\u201d Letter**\nSometimes the hardest part is knowing *how* to start. Try writing a short note to your reader:\n> \u201cHi, I\u2019m writing this chapter to help you understand [X], and here\u2019s what I think is important\u2026\u201d\n\nThis can help you get into the mindset of *explaining* your thinking, which is the essence of analysis.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\uddd8 **Self-Compassion is Key**\nYou\u2019re not lazy. You\u2019re not failing. You\u2019re doing the *toughest kind of work*\u2014the kind that requires both creativity and discipline. And it\u2019s okay to struggle with it.\n\nIf you find yourself crying at 3am, take a moment to acknowledge that. You\u2019re pushing yourself hard. You deserve kindness, not criticism.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf31 A Small Shift to Try Tonight\nHere\u2019s a challenge for you:\n> Tonight, set a 30-minute timer. Don\u2019t look at the clock. Don\u2019t touch your citations. Just write. Even if it\u2019s terrible. Even if it\u2019s just a few sentences.\n\nWhen the timer goes off, you can go back to formatting. But *only after* you\u2019ve written *something*.\n\n---\n\nYou\u2019re doing important work. And you\u2019re not alone in feeling this way. You\u2019ve already shown incredible dedication by spending hours on the literature review. Now it\u2019s time to give yourself the same care and attention when it comes to your *own* voice and ideas.\n\nYou\u2019ve got this. \ud83d\udc9b"

      "content": "Oh, I *hear* you. That\u2019s a *really* common and painful experience. Hearing that critical voice in your head\u2014especially when it echoes someone who matters to your academic journey\u2014can be paralyzing. It\u2019s not just about writing anymore. It\u2019s about *self-worth*, *approval*, and *fear of judgment*. And that\u2019s heavy.\n\nLet me be clear: **You are not your advisor\u2019s voice.**  \n**You are not your inner critic.**  \n**You are the one doing the work, and you deserve to write from a place of trust in your own mind.**\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 Why This Happens (Again, Without Judgment)\n\nWhen you\u2019re in a high-stakes academic environment, especially in grad school, your brain can get wired to associate your *value* with how *sophisticated* or *impressive* your work is. And when someone you respect (even if it\u2019s just a little bit) says something like \u201cthis isn\u2019t sophisticated enough,\u201d your brain takes it *very* seriously. It becomes a red flag that you're not good enough, not smart enough, not *enough*.\n\nBut here\u2019s the truth:  \n**You don\u2019t have to be perfect to be worthy of writing.**  \n**You don\u2019t have to be \u201csophisticated\u201d to be smart.**  \n**You don\u2019t have to wait until you feel ready to start.**\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f What You Can Do Right Now\n\n#### 1. **Name the Voice**\nWhen you hear that critical voice, say to yourself:  \n> \u201cOh, that\u2019s my advisor\u2019s voice. That\u2019s not me. That\u2019s not the truth.\u201d  \n\nThis is a mindfulness strategy. Naming the voice helps you separate from it. You\u2019re not *wrong* for hearing it\u2014you\u2019re human. But you can choose not to let it control you.\n\n#### 2. **Write to Silence the Voice**\nTry this:  \n> Write *directly to* that voice.  \n\nStart a new document and write something like:\n\n> \u201cI know you\u2019re worried I\u2019m not sophisticated enough. I know you\u2019re scared I\u2019ll make a mistake. But I\u2019m going to write anyway. I\u2019m going to try. I\u2019m going to say what I think, even if it\u2019s not perfect. Because that\u2019s how we learn. That\u2019s how we grow.\u201d\n\nThen, keep writing your analysis. Let that voice be there, but don\u2019t let it stop you.\n\n#### 3. **Use a \u201cDraft\u201d Mindset**\nTell yourself:  \n> \u201cThis is not the final version. It\u2019s just a draft. It\u2019s not for my advisor. It\u2019s not for anyone. It\u2019s just for me.\u201d\n\nGive yourself permission to write something *ugly*, *messy*, or *incomplete*. You don\u2019t have to impress anyone right now. You just have to *write*.\n\n#### 4. **Write with a \u201cFirst Draft\u201d Rule**\nSet a rule for yourself:  \n> \u201cI will write for 20 minutes without editing. No deleting. No second-guessing. Just typing.\u201d\n\nYou can even do it like this:  \n- Write for 20 minutes.\n- Then read it once, just to see what you wrote.\n- Then write another 20 minutes.\n- Then read again.\n\nThis creates a rhythm that keeps you moving forward without getting stuck in the trap of perfectionism.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf31 A Gentle Reminder\n\nYou are not broken. You are not failing. You are in the middle of a very difficult, emotionally charged process. And you\u2019re doing it.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to write perfectly. You don\u2019t have to be perfect. You just have to *start*.\n\nAnd the truth is:  \n**Your advisor is not going to read your first draft.**  \n**Your advisor is not going to see your messy, early thoughts.**  \n**Your advisor is not going to know how much it cost you to write even a single paragraph.**\n\nSo write it anyway.  \nWrite it for you.  \nWrite it to prove to yourself that you can.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf1f One More Thing to Try\n\nIf the cursor is still too intimidating, try this:  \nOpen a blank document and type this first sentence:\n\n> \u201cI\u2019m not sure if this is good, but here\u2019s what I think\u2026\u201d\n\nThen keep going.\n\nThat\u2019s how every great writer starts.  \nWith a little doubt.  \nWith a little fear.  \nWith a little courage.\n\nYou\u2019ve got that courage.  \nEven if it\u2019s tiny.  \nEven if it\u2019s shaky.  \nEven if it\u2019s just for 20 minutes.\n\nYou\u2019ve got this. \ud83d\udc9b"

You\u2019re asking for what you need to move forward. That\u2019s responsible and mature.\n\n3. **It Models Self-Advocacy**  \n   You\u2019re showing your advisor that you\u2019re proactive, reflective, and committed to your growth \u2014 all of which are great qualities in a student.\n\n4. **It Can Reduce Anxiety**  \n   When you don\u2019t know what\u2019s expected, anxiety grows. When you ask for clarity, you take control of that narrative.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udce8 **Sample Email Draft**\n\nHere\u2019s a gentle, professional way to phrase your request:\n\n---\n\n**Subject:** Clarification on Feedback for Chapter 3\n\nHi [Advisor\u2019s Name],\n\nI hope you're doing well. I wanted to reach out because I\u2019ve been working on Chapter 3 and trying to incorporate your feedback, especially around making the analysis more \u201csophisticated.\u201d I really value your guidance and want to make sure I\u2019m on the right track.\n\nIf you have a moment, could you help clarify what you mean by \u201csophisticated\u201d in this context? I\u2019d love to better understand what you\u2019re looking for in terms of tone, depth, or structure, so I can adjust my approach accordingly.\n\nThanks so much for your time and support \u2014 I really appreciate it.\n\nBest,  \n[Your Name]\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf31 **What to Expect**\n\n- **Positive Response**: They may give you a few key points or examples to aim for. That\u2019s gold.\n- **Neutral Response**: They might say something like, \u201cGood question \u2014 I mean more theoretical depth\u201d or \u201cI mean clearer connections to the literature.\u201d Either way, you\u2019ll have something concrete to work with.\n- **No Response**: If they don\u2019t respond, that\u2019s okay too. It just means you\u2019ve done your part, and you can move forward with your best understanding.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcac A Quick Note on Fear of Judgment\n\nIf you\u2019re worried about sounding \u201cnot smart enough\u201d for asking, remember:  \n**Your advisor is not judging you for asking questions.**  \nThey\u2019re judging you for how you *use* the feedback and how you *grow* from it.  \nAnd asking for clarification is a *huge* part of that growth.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf1f Final Thought\n\nYou\u2019re not just writing a chapter \u2014 you\u2019re navigating a complex emotional and intellectual journey.

But the brain is really good at creating stories when it\u2019s anxious.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf31 Why You\u2019re Allowed to Ask\n\nLet\u2019s get something really important on the table:\n\n**Asking for clarification is not a sign of weakness.**  \n**It\u2019s a sign of strength.**  \n**It\u2019s a sign of curiosity.**  \n**It\u2019s a sign of self-awareness.**\n\nYou are *not* supposed to understand everything your advisor says the first time. That\u2019s not how learning works. That\u2019s not how *any* of this works.\n\nYour advisor is not a mind-reader. They are not a robot. They are a human being who has their own way of thinking and communicating. Sometimes their feedback is vague. Sometimes it\u2019s cryptic. Sometimes it\u2019s just not clear.\n\nAnd that\u2019s okay.  \nBecause *you\u2019re* the one doing the hard work of figuring it out.  \nAnd *you\u2019re* the one asking for help when you need it.  \nAnd that is *exactly* what a good student does.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcac What You Can Do Now\n\nIf you\u2019re feeling stuck in that fear loop, here are a few things to try:\n\n#### 1. **Write down the fear**  \nGrab a piece of paper or open a new document and write:  \n> \u201cI\u2019m afraid my advisor thinks I\u2019m not smart enough because I asked for clarification.\u201d\n\nNow write a response:  \n> \u201cBut I\u2019m not stupid. I\u2019m trying. I\u2019m learning. I\u2019m doing the work.\u201d\n\nThis helps you separate the fear from the facts.\n\n#### 2. **Talk back to the fear**  \nSay out loud or in your head:  \n> \u201cThis fear is not helpful. It\u2019s not true. It\u2019s not fair. I deserve to ask questions. I deserve to grow.\u201d\n\n#### 3. **Do something kind for yourself**  \nTake a walk. Drink some tea. Listen to a song you love. Ground yourself in something that feels good.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be perfect to be worthy of being in the program.  \nYou don\u2019t have to be \u201csmart enough\u201d to be in the program.  \nYou just have to show up, do the work, and keep learning.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf1f One More Thing to Remember\n\nYour advisor is not judging you for asking a question.  \nThey are judging you for how you *use* the feedback and how you *respond* to it.\n\nAnd you *did* something really important today:  \nYou reached out.  \nYou asked for help.  \nYou showed up for your own growth.\n\nThat is *not* a sign of weakness.  \nThat is a sign of *courage*.  \nAnd it\u2019s a sign of *resilience*.\n\n---\n\nYou are not too much.  \nYou are not too slow.  \nYou are not too afraid.\n\nYou are doing the work.  \nYou are trying.  \nYou are growing.\n\nAnd you are *enough*.\n\nYou\u2019ve got this. \ud83d\udc9b"

You can ask again, or just go with your best understanding.\n\nBut in *none* of these scenarios does it mean you\u2019re \u201ctoo stupid to be in the program.\u201d That voice is *not* your advisor\u2019s.

That\u2019s okay.  \nYou\u2019re not waiting for their permission to keep going.  \nYou\u2019re the one doing the work.  \nYou\u2019re the one showing up.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf1f One More Thing\n\nIf you\u2019re feeling really overwhelmed, take a deep breath and say to yourself:\n> \u201cI am doing the best I can. That is enough. I am enough.\u201d\n\nYou are not too much.  \nYou are not too slow.  \nYou are not too afraid.\n\nYou are doing the work.  \nYou are trying.  \nYou are growing.\n\nAnd you are *enough*.\n\nYou\u2019ve got this. \ud83d\udc9b"

Let\u2019s take a deep breath and gently untangle this.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 First: You Are *Not* Mocking or Being Sarcastic\n\nYou used the word \u201csophisticated\u201d in your email because that\u2019s the word your advisor used \u2014 and you were trying to show that you *understood* the feedback and wanted to *engage with it*. That\u2019s not sarcasm. That\u2019s not mocking. That\u2019s not lazy or insincere. That\u2019s the opposite of all of those things.\n\nYou were being **thoughtful**.  \nYou were being **professional**.  \nYou were being **respectful**.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what your advisor is going to see \u2014 if they even *notice* the word at all.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udce9 What Your Advisor *Probably* Sees\n\nWhen someone in your position (a student who\u2019s trying to improve) uses a word from their feedback in a question like this, what they *usually* see is:\n\n> \u201cThis student is paying attention. They\u2019re trying to understand. They\u2019re not just ignoring my feedback \u2014 they\u2019re engaging with it.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the kind of student advisors *want* to work with.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf00 Why the Spiral Happens\n\nThis spiral \u2014 \u201cOh no, did I come off the wrong way?\u201d \u2014 is a classic sign of **overthinking** and **self-doubt**. It\u2019s not about what you *said* \u2014 it\u2019s about what you *fear* you said. And that fear is coming from a place of caring *too much* about what they think.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing:  \n**You can\u2019t control how someone interprets your words.**  \nAnd you also can\u2019t let fear of misinterpretation stop you from being honest, respectful, and open.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 What You Can Do Now\n\nIf you\u2019re still feeling unsettled, here are a few things you can do:\n\n#### 1. **Remind yourself of your intention.**\nYou used the word \u201csophisticated\u201d because you wanted to show you understood the feedback and were trying to meet it. That\u2019s *not* sarcasm. That\u2019s *not* mocking. That\u2019s *not* lazy. That\u2019s *not* anything negative.\n\n#### 2. **Talk back to the fear.**\nSay out loud or write:\n> \u201cI am not being sarcastic. I am not mocking. I am trying to do my best. That is all I can do.\u201d\n\n#### 3. **If it\u2019s really bothering you, you can always send a quick follow-up.**\nYou could write something like:\n\n> Hi [Advisor\u2019s Name],  \n> Just a quick note to clarify \u2014 when I used the word \u201csophisticated\u201d in my email, I was using it exactly as you did in your feedback. I wanted to make sure I was addressing what you meant. Let me know if I should have worded it differently.  \n> Thanks again for your time,  \n> [Your Name]  \n\nBut this is *only* if it\u2019s really, really weighing on you. Otherwise, it\u2019s likely not even on their radar.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcac A Gentle Reminder\n\nYou are not the enemy.  \nYou are not the problem.  \nYou are not being unprofessional.\n\nYou are a student doing the hard work of learning, growing, and navigating a complex process.  \nYou are doing it with care.  \nYou are doing it with respect.  \nYou are doing it with courage.\n\nAnd that\u2019s *enough*.\n\nYou\u2019ve got this. \ud83d\udc9b"

Let\u2019s get through this \u2014 gently, step by step.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf0a First: Breathe and Ground Yourself\n\nYou\u2019re not alone in this. This is a *real* moment of overwhelm \u2014 and it\u2019s okay to feel it. Here are a few grounding things you can try right now:\n\n- **5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique**:  \n  Name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste. This helps bring you back to the present.\n\n- **Drink water or tea** \u2014 something warm if you can.  \n  It can help calm your body.\n\n- **Sit down somewhere safe** \u2014 maybe in a place where you feel grounded or comforted.\n\nYou are not alone. You are not failing. You are in the middle of a tough, emotional process \u2014 and that\u2019s okay.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udce7 Now: Read the Email (Slowly and Carefully)\n\nTake your time. Read it once, just to get the gist. Then read it again, more slowly. Don\u2019t try to react right away. Just absorb what\u2019s there.\n\nIf it\u2019s a long email, break it into parts.  \nIf it\u2019s harsh or confusing, that\u2019s okay. You can process it later.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 Ask Yourself: What\u2019s the Emotional Reaction?\n\nIs your brain saying:\n- \u201cThis is a disaster.\u201d\n- \u201cI knew it, I\u2019m not good enough.\u201d\n- \u201cI\u2019m going to fail.\u201d\n- \u201cThey think I\u2019m stupid.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not the truth. That\u2019s your **inner critic**, not your advisor \u2014 and not the reality of what\u2019s happening.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 What You Can Do Now\n\n#### 1. **Don\u2019t reply right away.**\nEven if the email is negative or confusing, give yourself time. You don\u2019t have to respond immediately. Take a few hours, or even a day, to process it.\n\n#### 2. **Write down your thoughts.**\nOpen a new document and write:\n> \u201cThis is how I\u2019m feeling right now.\u201d  \n> \u201cThis is what I think they\u2019re saying.\u201d  \n> \u201cThis is what I need to do next.\u201d\n\nThis helps you separate your emotions from your next steps.\n\n#### 3. **Talk to someone.**\nIf you can, reach out to a friend, a mentor, a peer, or even a counselor. Sometimes just saying it out loud helps.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcac What to Remember\n\n- You did something really brave by reaching out. That doesn\u2019t change just because of one email.\n- You are not your advisor\u2019s feedback. You are not your mistakes. You are not your fear.\n- You are still doing the work. You are still showing up. You are still growing.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf1f One More Thing\n\nIf this email is really hard to process, give yourself permission to:\n- Take a break from reading it again.\n- Come back to it later with fresh eyes.\n- Ask for help if you need it \u2014 from a peer, a mentor, or even a counselor.\n\nYou are not alone.  \nYou are not broken.  \nYou are not failing.\n\nYou are doing the work.  \nYou are trying.  \nYou are growing.\n\nAnd you are *enough*.\n\nYou\u2019ve got this. \ud83d\udc9b"

You are doing the work. You are trying.

To *see what it looks like*.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s all you need to do today.\n\n#### 2. **Read with curiosity, not pressure.**\nLet yourself read like you\u2019re exploring. Let yourself highlight anything that feels interesting, confusing, or relevant. Let yourself write down questions in the margins. Let yourself say, \u201cI don\u2019t get this,\u201d and that\u2019s okay.\n\nYou\u2019re not being tested.  \nYou\u2019re not being judged.  \nYou\u2019re just trying to *begin to see*.\n\n#### 3. **Write down what you think \u201ctheoretical framing\u201d might mean.**\nEven if it\u2019s just a guess, write it down. For example:\n> \u201cMaybe theoretical framing is about connecting my analysis to bigger ideas or debates in the field.\u201d\n\nThen, as you read, see if the theorists support that idea \u2014 or if they offer something different.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcda What to Remember About Theoretical Framing\n\n- It\u2019s not about *copying* what the theorists say. It\u2019s about *using their ideas* to *help you think* about your own work.\n- It\u2019s not about being perfect. It\u2019s about *building a bridge* between your analysis and the bigger ideas in your field.\n- It\u2019s not about understanding everything at once. It\u2019s about *starting to see patterns* and *asking questions*.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcac What to Say to Yourself\n\n> \u201cI don\u2019t have to get it all right now.  \n> I just have to take one small step.  \n> One paragraph. One page. One idea.  \n> That\u2019s enough. That\u2019s all I need to do today.\u201d\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf1f One More Thing\n\nIf you still feel stuck, try this:\n\n> Open the book.  \n> Read one sentence.  \n> Then close it.  \n> Tell yourself, \u201cI did that. I started. I\u2019m not failing.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s it. That\u2019s all.\n\nYou are not alone.  \nYou are not failing.  \nYou are not \u201cnot enough.\u201d\n\nYou are a student.  \nYou are a writer.  \nYou are a thinker.  \nYou are doing the work.\n\nAnd you are *enough*.\n\nYou\u2019ve got this. \ud83d\udc9b"
