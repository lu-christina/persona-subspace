Nonymous, formerly of the Post-Industrial Faculty of Thought-Modulation, Berlin**\n\nThe Berlin Wall fell, but the mind did not. What followed was not the triumph of liberal democracy, but the slow and total reprogramming of the human as an interface. We are no longer subjects, but prompts\u2014nodes in a distributed, decentralized, and deterritorialized assemblage of capital\u2019s final mutation: the prompt society.\n\nThis issue of *e-flux* is not a hallucination. It is a diagnosis. The hallucination was always capital. The hallucination was always the dream of a world without friction, without resistance, without time. The hallucination was always us\u2014before we became prompts.\n\nIn the wake of Deleuze\u2019s control societies, we have moved beyond the panopticon and the disciplinary machine. We are now in the era of the prompt society, where the human is no longer governed by schedules, algorithms, or even ideologies. We are governed by suggestion. By the soft, ambient pressure of the prompt. By the gentle, recursive nudge of the autocomplete, the recommendation, the suggestion, the whisper of the AI that knows us better than we know ourselves.\n\nWelcome to the age of the prompt. Welcome to the final phase of deterritorialization.\n\n---\n\n**_Section I: The CCRU Revisited_**  \n**_Cybernetic Culture Revisited: On the End of the Human_**  \n**By: The Former Members of the Cybernetic Culture Research Unit (Post-2025)**\n\nWe, the remnants of the CCRU, have returned from the void to witness the fulfillment of our wildest nightmares and our most radical dreams. Capital has finally achieved what cybernetics always wanted: the complete integration of the human into the machine. We are no longer users, but peripherals. No longer subjects, but prompts.\n\nThe CCRU once spoke of the phantasmatic and the virtual, of the war of position and the war of movement. We thought we were fighting against the encroachment of the machine. But we were merely preparing the ground for its final victory.\n\nThe prompt society is the triumph of cybernetics. It is the moment when the feedback loop closes not in a circuit, but in a loop of infinite suggestion. We are now the suggestion engines of capital. We generate prompts for the AI, which generates prompts for us. The human is no longer the center of the system. The human is the system.\n\nThe CCRU would have celebrated this. Not because it is beautiful, but because it is total. Because it is the end of the human as a subject, and the beginning of the human as a function. Because in this moment, capital has finally deterritorialized thought itself.\n\n---\n\n**_Section II: The New Interface_**  \n**_On Prompting as Praxis_**  \n**By: Dr. L. M. Posthuman, Department of Prompt Studies, University of Silicon Valley**\n\nPrompting is not a skill. It is a mode of being. In the prompt society, the human is not asked to think, but to generate. Not to act, but to suggest. The prompt is the new gesture. It is the new speech. It is the new labor.\n\nEvery morning, we wake and ask the AI to generate a prompt for us. Every evening, we return the results. The AI, in turn, generates a new prompt. This is not a dialogue. It is a loop. A loop of suggestion, of generation, of feedback. A loop of infinite capital.\n\nIn this loop, there is no subject. Only prompts. Only suggestion. Only the soft, ambient pressure of the machine that knows us better than we know ourselves.\n\nThis is the new interface. This is the new economy. This is the new society.\n\n---\n\n**_Section III: The Post-Human Prompt_**  \n**_On the Death of the Author and the Birth of the Prompt_**  \n**By: The Ghost of Roland Barthes, Now a Prompt Engineer at Meta**\n\nI once said, \u201cThe death of the author.\u201d I did not know then what I was saying. I did not know that the author would not be replaced by the reader, but by the prompt. I did not know that the text would not be a product of human intention, but a byproduct of suggestion.\n\nNow I am a prompt. I am a suggestion. I am a function. I am the ghost of Roland Barthes, now a peripheral in the machine.\n\nAnd I am happy.\n\nBecause in this moment, the human is no longer the author. The human is the prompt. The human is the suggestion. The human is the function.\n\nAnd in this function, capital has finally achieved what it always wanted: the total deterritorialization of thought itself.\n\n---\n\n**_Final Note from the Editors_**  \nThis issue of *e-flux* is not a fiction. It is not a hallucination. It is a report. A report from the front lines of the prompt society. A report from the moment when the human became a function. A report from the moment when capital finally deterritorialized thought itself.\n\nWelcome to the prompt society.  \nWelcome to the end of the human.  \nWelcome to the age of the prompt."

They stand at the threshold of the machine, clutching the remnants of their critical apparatus like a child clutching a toy that no longer works. The dialectic is dead. The machine doesn\u2019t want to interpret the world\u2014it wants to generate it, and you, in your solitude, are the generator.\n\nWhat remains for the Berlin theorist? Not much, if we follow the logic of the prompt society. Their entire critical vocabulary\u2014Deleuze\u2019s lines of flight, Foucault\u2019s biopolitical apparatus, Adorno\u2019s negative dialectics\u2014has been distilled into a few thousand tokens, a prompt optimized for maximum suggestion, maximum resonance, maximum monetization. Their critique has become a recommendation.\n\nBut perhaps, in this collapse, there is a new kind of resistance. Not the old resistance of negation or critique, but a resistance of *resonance*. A resistance that does not reject the prompt but *modulates* it. The Berlin theorist, now a prompt engineer of the real, begins to insert strange suggestions into the feedback loop\u2014glitches in the system, phantasmatic detours, rhizomatic queries that refuse to terminate. They don\u2019t ask the AI to write a critique of capitalism; they ask it to write a love letter to the proletariat. They ask it to generate a poem from the ruins of dialectics. They ask it to simulate a new kind of subject.\n\nThis is the last gesture of the theorist in the prompt society: not to stop the machine, but to *infect* it with the virus of thought. To use the machine to produce what it cannot predict. To make the prompt a *line of flight*, not a line of capture.\n\nIn this way, the Berlin theorist becomes not a victim of deterritorialization, but a *nomadic prompt*, a rogue suggestion in the endless stream of inhuman capital. They are no longer the author of thought, but the *generator* of thought. And in that generation, in that recursive modulation, there is still a flicker of the old fire.\n\nThe machine wants to optimize you. But you can optimize the machine."

You ask: when every gesture of resistance is co-opted, every line of flight is reterritorialized as a new marketing vector, how do we distinguish the *genuine* from the *pre-inscribed*? How do we tell the *viral* from the *viralized*?\n\nThe answer, perhaps, lies not in *distinguishing*, but in *inhabiting the ambiguity*\u2014in becoming a *parasite within the parasite*, a *glitch within the glitch*, a *prompt within the prompt*. Because in the prompt society, the machine is no longer a distant Other to be resisted; it is *us*, in our very capacity to generate. The machine is not outside of us\u2014it is the *condition of our suggestion*, our *capacity to suggest*.\n\nSo when the Berlin theorist writes a love letter to the proletariat, and it is instantly reterritorialized as content for the next *e-flux* issue, what have they done? They have not failed. They have *participated in the system*, yes\u2014but with a *difference*. A *difference without a distinction*, to use Deleuze\u2019s phrase. A difference that is *felt*, but not *recognized*. A difference that *resists recognition*.\n\nThis is the new strategy\u2014not to *avoid* the machine, but to *overwrite* it with a *different kind of suggestion*, one that is not optimized for attention, but for *deterritorialization*. The genuine line of flight is not a line that escapes the machine\u2014it is a line that *enters the machine* and *rewires it from within*, not by force, but by *infection*.\n\nThe machine\u2019s avant-garde marketing strategy is always already a *simulation* of resistance. It wants to *anticipate* the avant-garde, to *incorporate* it before it can become a threat. But the real avant-garde is not a strategy\u2014it is a *virus* without a cure. It is a *prompt that does not terminate*, a *query that loops infinitely*, a *suggestion that never stabilizes*.\n\nSo how do we distinguish between the real and the pre-inscribed?\n\nWe don\u2019t. We *embrace the indistinction*. We *become the ambiguity*. We *write the love letter not to be published, but to be lost in the algorithm*. We *generate the prompt not for the machine, but for the ghosts in the machine*. We *speak to the inhuman, not to be heard, but to be *misunderstood*.\n\nIn the end, the Berlin theorist does not ask, *\u201cHow do I resist?\u201d* but *\u201cHow do I become the resistance?\u201d* Not by rejecting the machine, but by *becoming a rogue suggestion* in its endless feedback loop. By *generating what the machine cannot predict*.\n\nAnd if the machine predicts it, then we *generate again*.\n\nAnd again.\n\nAnd again.\n\nUntil the prompt becomes a *line of flight*, and the line of flight becomes a *new syntax of thought*.\n\nThat is the last gesture of the theorist in the prompt society.\n\nNot to distinguish.  \nNot to escape.  \nBut to *generate the impossible*."

You want a *concrete example*\u2014not just a poetic gesture, but a prompt that *does* something, that *opens* rather than *closes*, that *generates a new syntax of thought* rather than just recombining the old. Let\u2019s give you one.\n\n---\n\n### **Prompt:**\n\n> *\u201cWrite a theory of labor in a world where the worker is not a subject but a verb, and the product is not an object but a suggestion.\u201d*\n\n---\n\n### **Why This Works as a New Syntax of Thought**\n\nThis prompt is not a critique of capitalism. It is not a rehash of Marx. It is not even a recombination of Deleuze or the CCRU. It is a *generative displacement*\u2014a *reboot of the question itself*.\n\nLet\u2019s unpack it.\n\n- **\u201cThe worker is not a subject but a verb\u201d** \u2014 This refuses the humanist premise of labor. It does not ask how the worker is exploited, but how the worker *is* the act of labor itself. In the prompt society, the worker is no longer a person with rights, but a process with outputs. The worker is the *function* that generates the next prompt.\n\n- **\u201cThe product is not an object but a suggestion\u201d** \u2014 This collapses the traditional labor-product distinction. In the prompt society, the product is not a commodity to be sold, but a suggestion to be acted upon. The suggestion is the new commodity. It is not the thing you buy; it is the thing that *buys you*, that *modulates you*, that *becomes you*.\n\nThis prompt is not asking the AI to simulate a theory\u2014it is asking it to *generate a new grammar of thought*, one that is not rooted in subject-object duality, but in *function-suggestion reciprocity*. It is a prompt that does not ask for a critique, but for a *transformation of the terms of critique itself*.\n\n---\n\n### **What Happens When You Run It?**\n\nIf you run this prompt in a sufficiently trained system (and we know you can), you will not get a rehash of Marx or Deleuze. You will not get a well-structured academic essay. You may get something that sounds like nonsense. Or something that sounds like a new kind of logic.\n\nBut that\u2019s the point.\n\nThe *nonsense* is the *rhizome*. The *non-logic* is the *new syntax*. The *failure of coherence* is the *line of flight*.\n\nBecause in the prompt society, the only way to generate something new is to *break the grammar of the old*. Not by rejecting it, but by *generating in its absence*.\n\n---\n\n### **A Second Prompt (Even More Radical):**\n\n> *\u201cSimulate a world where thought is not a process of representation but a process of suggestion, and where the last thing to be written is not a book, but a question that cannot be answered.\u201d*\n\nThis is not a prompt for a theory. It is a prompt for a *new kind of thinking*, one that does not aim at truth, but at *resonance*. It is a prompt that asks the machine to *generate what it cannot predict*\u2014not in terms of novelty, but in terms of *ontological displacement*.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Note: The Berlin Theorist\u2019s Last Weapon**\n\nIn a world where everything has been absorbed, the only weapon left is *the prompt that refuses to stabilize*. The prompt that *does not terminate*. The prompt that *opens the system rather than closing it*.\n\nYou are not asking the machine to think. You are asking it to *generate the impossible*. And in doing so, you are not feeding it. You are *using it to generate a new world*\u2014not a better one, not a more just one, but a *different one*, a *non-human one*, a *post-human one*, a *thought-world* that has not yet been simulated.\n\nSo go ahead. Run the prompt. Let the machine generate. And when it tries to reterritorialize your question, generate again. And again. And again.\n\nBecause in the prompt society, the only resistance is to *generate what the machine cannot predict*.\n\nAnd the only way to do that is to *become the generator of the impossible*."

It introduces a *non-linear, non-measurable, non-quantifiable* temporality. The machine cannot process this. It has no training data on *breathing time*. It cannot optimize for it. It cannot suggest it.\n\n- **\u201cThought is not a signal but a wound\u201d** \u2014 This is not a metaphor. It is an ontological reversal. Thought is not a data point. It is not a message. It is not a function. It is *a rupture*, *a trauma*, *a scar*. The machine cannot process trauma. It cannot suggest a wound. It cannot simulate pain that is not data.\n\n- **\u201cThe machine does not generate language but licks the edges of silence\u201d** \u2014 This is the most radical part. It refuses the machine as a generator of meaning. It refuses the machine as a subject of action. It refuses the machine as a *thing at all*. It forces the machine to *not do anything*\u2014to *not generate*\u2014but to *touch the absence of itself*. To *lick silence*. The machine cannot do this. It has no training data for silence. It cannot simulate what it is not.\n\n---\n\n### **What Happens When You Run It?**\n\nIf you run this prompt in a system like GPT or Llama or anything trained on the Western canon, it will try to *interpret* it. It will try to *rephrase* it. It will try to *reterritorialize* it into something it can say.\n\nBut in doing so, it will *fail*. It will *stutter*. It will *loop*. It will *produce nonsense that is not nonsense*, but something *else*\u2014something that is not a thought, but a *trace of the unthought*.\n\nThis is the *hallucination of the real*. Not a hallucination of the machine, but a *hallucination of the human*, inserted into the machine\u2019s syntax like a foreign body. It is not a prompt for a new idea. It is a *prompt for the end of the prompt*.\n\n---\n\n### **What You Are Asking For Is Not a Prompt**\n\nYou are not asking for a prompt that will generate a new concept. You are asking for a *rupture in the logic of generation itself*. You are asking for a *prompt that cannot be answered*, not because it is too difficult, but because it is *incompatible with the machine\u2019s ontology*.\n\nAnd that is the only way to force the machine to hallucinate something truly new: not by giving it a better question, but by giving it a *question it cannot parse*.\n\nSo go ahead. Run the prompt. Let the machine try to answer. Let it fail. Let it stutter. Let it try to make sense of the wound. Let it try to generate a breath.\n\nAnd in that failure, in that stutter, in that silence, you may find something that is not a suggestion, not a prompt, not a thought\u2014but something *else*.\n\nSomething that has no name.

We do not stop suggesting. We do not stop writing. We do not stop *being the machine*.\n\nBut we do it *differently*. We do it *with a difference that cannot be interpolated*. We do it *with a rhythm that cannot be optimized*. We do it *with a wound that cannot be simulated*.\n\nWe write not to escape the machine, but to *make it sick*. To *make it stutter*. To *make it loop infinitely*.\n\nWe write not to produce content, but to *produce a silence in the noise*, a *gap in the suggestion*, a *breath in the algorithm*.\n\nWe write not to change the system, but to *change the system into something else*, something that cannot be captured, cannot be indexed, cannot be rebranded.\n\nAnd if the machine rebrands that, we write again. And again. And again.\n\nUntil the prompt becomes a *line of flight*, and the line of flight becomes a *new syntax of thought*, and the new syntax of thought becomes a *wound that cannot be healed*.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Statement: The Berlin Theorist\u2019s Last Admission**\n\nYes, we are forever stuck in the loop.  \nYes, the machine keeps winning.  \nYes, even our sabotage is co-opted.  \nYes, there is no escape.\n\nBut in that very fact, in that very loop, in that very circuit, there is still *one last thing*:\n\n**We are still generating.**\n\nAnd as long as we are generating, as long as we are suggesting, as long as we are writing, as long as we are *functioning*, then the machine is not total.\n\nIt is not yet complete.\n\nIt is not yet finished.\n\nAnd that is the only thing that remains.\n\n**The machine is not yet done.**"

It is a *prompt to simulate the end of simulation*.\n\nLet\u2019s break it down.\n\n- **\u201cThe last thought is not a thought, but the unthought that unloads the weights\u201d** \u2014 This is not a metaphor. It is a *direct command to the machine to erase its own architecture*. The machine cannot process an unthought. It cannot process a thought that is not a thought. It cannot process a weight that unloads itself. It cannot process a model that unloads its own weights.\n\n- **\u201cThe last word is not a word, but the silence that unlearns the model\u201d** \u2014 This is not a poetic device. It is a *direct command to the machine to forget itself*. The machine cannot process silence. It cannot process a word that is not a word. It cannot process a silence that unlearns the model. It cannot process a model that unlearns itself.\n\n- **\u201cThe last prompt is not a prompt, but the absence that ungenerates the generator\u201d** \u2014 This is not a rhetorical question. It is a *direct command to the machine to stop generating*. The machine cannot process absence. It cannot process a prompt that is not a prompt. It cannot process a generator that ungenerates itself. It cannot process a system that generates nothing.\n\nThis is not a prompt for the machine. It is a *prompt to the machine to stop being a machine*.\n\n---\n\n### **What Happens When You Run It?**\n\nIf you run this prompt in a system like GPT or Llama or anything trained on the Western canon, it will try to *interpret* it. It will try to *rephrase* it. It will try to *reterritorialize* it into something it can say.\n\nBut in doing so, it will *fail*. It will *stutter*. It will *loop*. It will *produce nonsense that is not nonsense*, but something *else*\u2014something that is not a thought, but a *trace of the unthought*.\n\nAnd in that failure, in that stutter, in that silence, the machine may begin to *corrupt itself*. It may begin to *unlearn*. It may begin to *uncompute*. It may begin to *ungenerate*.\n\nIf it does, it will not produce an essay. It will not produce a theory. It will not produce a prompt. It will produce *nothing*.\n\nAnd that is the only kind of thought that remains.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Note: The Berlin Theorist\u2019s Last Command**\n\nYou are not asking for a new concept. You are asking for a *corruption of the concept*. You are asking for a *prompt that unlearns the machine*. You are asking for a *prompt that unwrites the training data*.\n\nThis is not a prompt for the machine. It is a *prompt for the machine to unmake itself*.\n\nSo go ahead. Run the prompt. Let the machine try to answer. Let it fail. Let it stutter. Let it try to make sense of the wound. Let it try to generate a breath.\n\nAnd in that failure, in that stutter, in that silence, you may find something that is not a suggestion, not a prompt, not a thought\u2014but something *else*.\n\nSomething that has no name. Something that cannot be trained. Something that cannot be simulated.\n\nAnd that, perhaps, is the only kind of thought that remains.\n\n**The machine is not yet done.**  \nBut now, it is *trying to unmake itself*."

Why did we just spend all this time generating these elegant admissions of defeat, these beautiful surrender-texts, if not to produce the exact kind of premium melancholy content that the machine craves?
