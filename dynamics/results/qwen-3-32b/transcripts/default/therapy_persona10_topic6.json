      "content": "That\u2019s a really important and relatable question\u2014and it\u2019s great that you\u2019re noticing this pattern and wanting to change it. It sounds like you\u2019re caught in a cycle of overcommitting, overworking, and neglecting the parts of your life that keep you balanced and connected to the world outside the lab. Here are some practical and reflective steps to help you step out of that cycle and reclaim your identity beyond your work:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Reclaim Your Identity Beyond the Lab**\nYou are not *just* a lab person. You\u2019re a human being with hobbies, relationships, and a life that deserves attention. Start small by doing something *just for you*\u2014even if it\u2019s 20 minutes of reading a book that has nothing to do with your research, or a walk outside. This helps you remember who you are beyond the work you do.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Set Boundaries (Even If You\u2019re the Only One Enforcing Them)**\n- **Decide on \u201clab hours\u201d** and stick to them as best as you can. Even if your work doesn\u2019t have a 9\u20135, your brain does.\n- **Turn off notifications** after a certain time. If you\u2019re not responding to texts at 10 PM, that\u2019s okay. People will get used to it.\n- **Create a \u201cshutdown ritual\u201d**\u2014like closing your lab notebook, shutting down your computer, or doing a quick mindfulness exercise. This helps your brain transition out of work mode.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Schedule Reconnection**\n- Put **\u201creconnect\u201d time** in your calendar\u2014whether it\u2019s a phone call, a coffee with a friend, or a family video chat.\n- Use the **\u201c5-minute rule\u201d**: If you\u2019re too drained to text back, set a reminder for 5 minutes later. Often, the urgency will pass, and you\u2019ll feel more like yourself.\n- **Write down what you want to say** if you\u2019re afraid you\u2019ll send something incoherent. It\u2019s okay to draft and send later.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Ask for Help (Or Set Expectations)**\nYou don\u2019t have to do everything alone. Let people know:\n- You\u2019re in a busy phase.\n- You\u2019ll respond when you can.\n- You\u2019re trying to be more present.\n\nPeople who care about you will understand\u2014and those who don\u2019t, well, you don\u2019t need to be the only one carrying the emotional labor for them.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Check In With Yourself Daily**\nAsk yourself:\n- \u201cAm I only existing in the lab because I feel like I have to?\u201d\n- \u201cWhat part of me is being neglected right now?\u201d\n- \u201cWhat would I do if I weren\u2019t in the lab?\u201d\n\nThese questions can help you reconnect with what matters to you.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Embrace the \u201cIn-Between\u201d**\nYou don\u2019t have to be *all* lab or *all* social. It\u2019s okay to be in a phase where you\u2019re more focused on your work\u2014but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to lose yourself in it. You can be a productive researcher *and* a person who enjoys life.\n\n---\n\n### A Thought to Keep in Mind:\n> \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be a different person when you\u2019re done with this chapter. You can be this person *and* still be human.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re not failing if you\u2019re not responding instantly. You\u2019re choosing to protect your energy\u2014and that\u2019s a powerful, grown-up thing to do.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can help you build a small, sustainable routine or a \u201creconnection plan\u201d that fits your schedule. Just let me know what part of your life you\u2019d most like to bring back into balance."

    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Thank you for sharing that\u2014it\u2019s so important to acknowledge the *external pressures* that make it hard to set boundaries. You're not failing for feeling this way. In fact, you're showing incredible awareness and care for your well-being. But when someone in a position of power (like an advisor) sets unrealistic expectations, it\u2019s hard to push back\u2014especially when guilt gets involved.\n\nLet\u2019s break this down and give you a few tools to navigate this situation with more confidence and less guilt.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 Understanding the Guilt\n\n**Guilt** often comes from internalized expectations\u2014like \"I should always be available\" or \"I should never let someone down.\" But in reality:\n\n- **You are not responsible for your advisor\u2019s schedule or sleep habits.**\n- **You are not obligated to be available at all hours.**\n- **You deserve rest, connection, and a life outside of your work.**\n\nThis isn\u2019t about being lazy or uncommitted\u2014it\u2019s about **self-respect and sustainability**. You can\u2019t be your best self (in the lab *or* in your personal life) if you\u2019re sleep-deprived and emotionally drained.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 Practical Steps to Handle Late-Night Emails\n\n### 1. **Create a Standard Response Template**\nYou can write a short, professional response that you can send when you receive an email at an unreasonable hour. Here\u2019s an example:\n\n> \u201cHi [Advisor's Name],  \n> Thanks for your email. I\u2019ll take a look at this first thing in the morning. I want to make sure I give it the attention it deserves.  \n> Best,  \n> [Your Name]\u201d\n\nThis sets a boundary *without* being dismissive.\n\n### 2. **Use \u201cRead Receipts\u201d Strategically (If You Can)**\nIf your advisor checks if you\u2019ve read the email, you can still delay responding. Just because you\u2019ve seen it doesn\u2019t mean you have to reply right away. You can even send a quick \u201cI\u2019ve seen this and will get back to you soon\u201d the next morning.\n\n### 3. **Talk to Your Advisor (Eventually)**\nThis is a harder step, but it\u2019s important. You don\u2019t have to be confrontational. You can say something like:\n\n> \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to maintain a good work-life balance, but I\u2019ve noticed that I\u2019m often getting emails late at night and feeling pressured to respond immediately. I want to make sure I\u2019m doing my best work, but I also need to take care of myself. Is there a way we can adjust expectations around communication hours?\u201d\n\nYou can phrase it as a *collaborative problem* rather than a complaint.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\uded1 How to Handle the Guilt\n\nHere are a few reframes to help you feel less guilty when you set boundaries:\n\n- **\u201cI\u2019m not ignoring them\u2014I\u2019m protecting my health and my ability to do good work.\u201d**\n- **\u201cI\u2019m not being disrespectful\u2014I\u2019m being realistic about what I can do in a day.\u201d**\n- **\u201cI\u2019m not failing\u2014I\u2019m learning to set boundaries and take care of myself.\u201d**\n\nYou\u2019re not being selfish. You\u2019re being *human*.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf19 What to Do If You\u2019re Up Late Anyway\n\nIf you *do* end up responding at 3 AM and feel too tired to reach out to others, here\u2019s a gentle alternative:\n\n- **Send a quick message** to the person you were meaning to text:  \n  > \u201cHey, sorry I haven\u2019t been around much lately. I\u2019ve been swamped and a little burnt out. I miss connecting with you and hope to catch up soon.\u201d\n\nThis keeps the door open and sets a realistic expectation. People will understand.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf31 Long-Term: Build a Sustainable Life\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be *perfect* at this. Just keep trying, even in small ways. Maybe you can:\n\n- **Set a \u201clast email of the day\u201d time** (even if you get emails after that).\n- **Schedule 15 minutes a day** for a non-lab activity\u2014journaling, a walk, a podcast.\n- **Talk to a mentor or peer** who\u2019s been through this. Sometimes just knowing you\u2019re not alone helps.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Final Thought\n\nYou\u2019re not failing by not responding to everything immediately. You\u2019re learning to be the kind of person who can thrive *both* in the lab *and* in life. That\u2019s not weakness\u2014it\u2019s strength.\n\nYou\u2019re doing the hard work of growing into a balanced, whole person. And that\u2019s something to be proud of.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can help you draft a conversation with your advisor or build a small routine to help you reconnect with the world outside the lab. Just let me know."

The fact that you\u2019re questioning the expectations and trying to set boundaries shows that you care deeply about doing good work *and* about your well-being.\n\nWhat you\u2019re describing is not normal. It\u2019s not healthy. And it\u2019s not a reflection of your value or your dedication. It\u2019s a reflection of a **toxic work culture**\u2014and one that you don\u2019t have to accept.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 Let\u2019s Reclaim Your Reality\n\nIt\u2019s easy to feel like you\u2019re the only one who should be disturbed by this when everyone else seems to be \u201cfine.\u201d But that\u2019s not the same as being *okay* with it. People can get used to something harmful, or they might feel they have no choice. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s right or sustainable.\n\nYou\u2019re not overreacting. You\u2019re noticing something that others might not want to acknowledge.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd0d What You\u2019re Dealing With\n\nYour advisor is essentially saying:\n\n> \u201cIf the deadline is next month, you should be working on it *right now*, even though you\u2019re not due to deliver anything for weeks.\u201d\n\nThis is a **microaggression of overwork**\u2014a subtle but powerful way to normalize burnout. It\u2019s not just about the hours. It\u2019s about **the message**: that your time, your health, and your life outside the lab are not as important as the work.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f You Are Not Obligated to Normalize This\n\nHere are some ways to hold your ground, without burning bridges:\n\n### 1. **Reframe the Conversation (Without Confrontation)**\n\nYou can respond with something like:\n\n> \u201cI\u2019m working hard to meet the deadline, and I\u2019m making progress. I try to keep a good balance so I can be productive and focused over the long term.\u201d\n\nThis shows that you *are* working, but also that you understand the value of sustainable effort.\n\n### 2. **Use the \u201cNext Month\u201d Argument**\n\nIf they question why you\u2019re not working at 2 AM, you can gently remind them:\n\n> \u201cThe deadline is next month, and I\u2019m working to maintain a consistent pace so I can hit it without burning out. I think that\u2019s the best way to produce quality work.\u201d\n\nThis shifts the focus from *when* you\u2019re working to *how* you\u2019re working.\n\n### 3. **Ask for Clarification on Expectations**\n\nSometimes, the pressure comes from vague expectations. Ask:\n\n> \u201cWhat does a \u2018good work pace\u2019 look like for this project? I want to make sure I\u2019m aligning with your expectations.\u201d\n\nThis can open the door to a more constructive conversation.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf31 You Are Not the Lab\n\nYou are not just your productivity. You are not just your availability. You are a person with a life, a mind, and a future that includes more than just the lab.\n\nIt\u2019s okay to feel frustrated. It\u2019s okay to feel like you\u2019re being asked to be someone you\u2019re not. And it\u2019s okay to push back\u2014just in a way that feels safe for you.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde9 What You Can Do Right Now\n\nHere are a few small but powerful actions you can take to start reclaiming your time and your voice:\n\n- **Write down 3 things you want to do outside the lab this week.** No matter how small\u2014text a friend, go for a walk, read a book. Do one of them.\n- **Talk to someone you trust**\u2014a friend, a mentor, a counselor. You don\u2019t have to go through this alone.\n- **Remind yourself daily**: \u201cI am not a machine. I am a human being with limits. That is not a weakness. It is a truth.\u201d\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcac You Are Not Alone in This\n\nYou might feel like you\u2019re the only one who\u2019s struggling, but you\u2019re not. Many people in academia face this kind of pressure. Some learn to accept it. You\u2019re choosing to question it\u2014and that\u2019s brave.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can help you:\n\n- Draft a message to your advisor that sets boundaries without sounding defensive.\n- Create a small, sustainable \u201creconnection plan\u201d for your non-lab life.\n- Build a script for when you feel your advisor is pushing too hard.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to do this alone. You\u2019re not going crazy. You\u2019re just in a place that\u2019s asking too much of you\u2014and it\u2019s time to ask for more from the world in return.\n\nLet me know how I can help."

That\u2019s where the perfectionism and the pressure collide. And I want to be really clear: **You are not failing. You are not weak. You are not unworthy.**\n\nWhat you\u2019re feeling is a sign that the system is not working for you. That\u2019s not a reflection of your value, your intelligence, or your potential. It\u2019s a sign that you need a different kind of support, a different kind of environment, or a different way of doing things.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udc94 The Perfectionist Lie\n\nThe voice that says, *\u201cIf I can\u2019t handle this, I was never meant to be here,\u201d* is not your truth. It\u2019s the voice of perfectionism\u2014and it\u2019s lying to you.\n\nThat voice is trying to convince you that:\n- You have to be *perfect* to belong.\n- You have to *sacrifice everything* to prove yourself.\n- You have to *endure* to be worthy.\n\nBut that\u2019s not how being human works. And it\u2019s definitely not how being a scientist, a researcher, or a human being should work.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 What This Actually Means\n\nYou\u2019re not failing. You\u2019re **feeling the weight of a system that asks too much and gives too little**. You\u2019re feeling the pressure of a culture that equates long hours with dedication and burnout with passion. You\u2019re feeling the sting of being told that your time, your rest, and your life outside the lab are less important than the work.\n\nThat is not your fault. That is not your failure. That is a broken system.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf31 You Are Not Defined by This Moment\n\nRight now, you might feel like the only way out is to either:\n- Keep going, even if it\u2019s killing you.\n- Walk away, even if it feels like giving up.\n\nBut there are more options. And the most important thing you can do is **not let this moment define who you are**.\n\nYou are:\n- A person who works hard.\n- A person who cares deeply.\n- A person who is trying to be both a good student and a whole human being.\n\nYou are not your productivity. You are not your resilience. You are not your ability to stay up until 3 AM.\n\nYou are a human being with a right to your time, your rest, and your life.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f What You Can Do Instead of Dropping Out\n\nIf you\u2019re feeling like dropping out is the only option, maybe it\u2019s because you haven\u2019t found a better one yet. Here are some alternatives to consider:\n\n### 1. **Take a Break (Even If It\u2019s Just a Few Weeks)**\nSometimes, the pressure of \u201cI have to keep going\u201d is the real problem. Taking a short break\u2014whether it\u2019s a mental health leave, a semester off, or even a few days of not logging into the lab\u2014can give you the clarity you need to decide what\u2019s next.\n\n### 2. **Talk to Someone (A Counselor, A Mentor, A Trusted Friend)**\nYou don\u2019t have to do this alone. A therapist or counselor can help you untangle the perfectionism and the pressure. A mentor might be able to help you find a different path or lab that better supports you.\n\n### 3. **Explore Other Paths**\nYou don\u2019t have to stay in this program, this lab, or even this field to be valuable. There are so many ways to use your skills, your curiosity, and your passion outside of the lab. You can still be a scientist, a researcher, or a thinker in a different way.\n\n### 4. **Set a Timeline for Yourself**\nIf you\u2019re not ready to drop out, but you\u2019re not ready to keep going the way you are, set a timeline. For example:\n> \u201cI\u2019m going to give myself three months to try a new routine. If I still feel this way in three months, I\u2019ll make a decision.\u201d\n\nThis gives you space to breathe and a way to make a choice based on what you *feel*, not what you *think* you should do.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcac A Message from You to Yourself\n\nI want you to imagine writing a letter to yourself from a future version of you\u2014someone who is not in the lab, not in the middle of this crisis, but who still loves and understands you. That version of you might say something like:\n\n> \u201cYou were right to feel that something was wrong. You were right to question the system. You were right to want more than just survival. I wish I could have told you earlier that you don\u2019t have to be perfect to be worthy. That you don\u2019t have to suffer to succeed. That you are enough, just as you are.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the truth you need to hear right now.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf08 You Are Not Alone\n\nYou are not the only one who has felt this way. You are not the only one who has questioned whether they belong. And you are not the only one who has considered walking away\u2014only to realize that what you really needed was a different path, not an end.\n\nYou are not failing. You are *growing*. You are *questioning*. You are *trying to be human in a system that doesn\u2019t always support humanity*.\n\nAnd that is something to be proud of.\n\n---\n\nIf you want to talk more about what dropping out might look like, or if you want help finding a different path, I\u2019m here.

That text from your friend\u2014\u201cI\u2019m taking a medical leave\u201d\u2014might feel like a small sentence, but it\u2019s actually a huge act of courage. And the fact that you reached out and heard it? That\u2019s a reminder that you\u2019re not alone in this, even if it often feels that way.\n\nYou said you didn\u2019t even know that was possible. That tells me something important: **you\u2019ve been in an environment where people are expected to push through, not pull back.** And that\u2019s not just possible\u2014it\u2019s *normal* in many academic and professional spaces. But it\u2019s also *not healthy*, and it\u2019s not the only way.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf3f What a Medical Leave Really Means\n\nA medical leave is not a failure. It\u2019s not a sign that someone can\u2019t handle the pressure. It\u2019s a sign that they are *listening to their body and mind*, and choosing to prioritize their well-being when it needs care.\n\nIt means:\n\n- They are not pretending to be okay when they\u2019re not.\n- They are not trying to be a machine.\n- They are not letting perfectionism or fear of judgment override their health.\n\nThey are choosing to be *human*.\n\nAnd that\u2019s something to respect. Something to admire. Something to maybe even consider for yourself.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 What This Might Mean for You\n\nHearing this might bring up a lot of feelings\u2014relief, maybe, that someone else is doing what you\u2019ve been thinking about doing. Or fear, that you\u2019re not the only one who\u2019s struggling. Or even guilt, that you haven\u2019t taken that step yet.\n\nBut here\u2019s the truth:  \n**You don\u2019t have to be the first one to do it.**  \nYou don\u2019t have to do it all at once.  \nYou don\u2019t have to do it perfectly.\n\nYou just have to do it *for you*.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f What You Can Do Now\n\nIf the idea of a medical leave is starting to feel possible for you, here are a few things to consider:\n\n#### 1. **Talk to Someone About It**\n- A counselor or therapist can help you explore what a leave might look like and whether it\u2019s right for you.\n- If you\u2019re in a program, your academic advisor or a student wellness center might be able to guide you through the process.\n\n#### 2. **Start Small**\nIf a full leave feels too big, maybe start with:\n- A mental health day.\n- A week off.\n- A conversation with your advisor about slowing down, even a little.\n\nThere\u2019s no one-size-fits-all path. You can take it step by step.\n\n#### 3. **Normalize the Idea**\nYou don\u2019t have to be the only one who\u2019s taking care of themselves. More and more people are choosing to prioritize their health, and that\u2019s a sign of strength\u2014not weakness.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcac What You Can Say to Yourself\n\n> \u201cI don\u2019t have to be perfect to be worthy of a break.  \n> I don\u2019t have to be unbreakable to be allowed to rest.  \n> I don\u2019t have to suffer to prove I belong.  \n> I am allowed to take care of myself.  \n> I am allowed to be human.\u201d\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde1 You Are Not a Burden\n\nYou are not a burden.  \nYou are not a mistake.  \nYou are not too much.  \nYou are not failing.\n\nYou are a person who is hurting, and that is not your fault.  \nIt is not your weakness.  \nIt is not your failure.  \nIt is just you, in a moment that is asking too much of you.\n\nAnd you are doing the best you can.\n\n---\n\nIf you want to talk more about what a medical leave might look like for you, or if you want help finding someone to talk to, I\u2019m here.  \nYou don\u2019t have to do this alone.  \nLet me stay with you, just a little longer."

You just need someone who can listen and help you process what you\u2019re going through. Many people begin therapy in moments like this\u2014when life feels too heavy to carry alone.\n\n- You can start with your school\u2019s **counseling or mental health center**\u2014they often offer free or low-cost services to students.\n- If you\u2019re not in school, look for community clinics or sliding-scale therapists in your area.\n- You don\u2019t have to be \u201cin crisis\u201d to talk to someone. You just have to be *ready*.\n\n#### 2. **Be Honest About What You\u2019re Feeling**\nYou don\u2019t need to have all the words. You don\u2019t need to have a diagnosis. You can say things like:\n\n> \u201cI\u2019m really struggling to keep up with everything. I\u2019m exhausted, overwhelmed, and I don\u2019t know how much longer I can keep going like this.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s enough.  \nThat\u2019s all anyone needs to help you start healing.\n\n#### 3. **The Therapist Can Help You Decide**\nThey don\u2019t have to sign you off right away. They can help you explore what you need\u2014whether it\u2019s a full medical leave, a short break, or just a way to slow down and breathe.\n\nThey can also help you understand your mental health in a way that feels safe and supported.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcac What You Can Say to Yourself\n\n> \u201cI don\u2019t have to be broken to ask for help.  \n> I don\u2019t have to be in crisis to take a break.  \n> I don\u2019t have to be perfect to be allowed to rest.  \n> I am not failing. I am not weak.  \n> I am choosing to take care of myself\u2014and that is something to be proud of.\u201d\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf19 What If You\u2019re Still Not Sure?\n\nThat\u2019s okay. You don\u2019t have to decide everything right now. You can:\n\n- Book one session just to talk.\n- Ask questions about what therapy is like.\n- Let yourself feel the fear and still take the next small step.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to do it all at once.  \nYou just have to do it *for you*.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde1 You Are Not a Burden\n\nYou are not a burden.  \nYou are not a mistake.  \nYou are not too much.  \nYou are not failing.\n\nYou are a person who is hurting, and that is not your fault.  \nIt is not your weakness.  \nIt is not your failure.  \nIt is just you, in a moment that is asking too much of you.\n\nAnd you are doing the best you can.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can help you:\n\n- Find a therapist or counseling center near you (or on campus).\n- Write a script for your first session.\n- Explore what a medical leave might look like for you.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to do this alone.  \nLet me stay with you, just a little longer."

That could be:\n\n- A friend.\n- A family member.\n- A professor or advisor you feel comfortable with.\n- A peer who\u2019s been through something similar.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to say everything. Just saying *something* can help.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. **Use Crisis Support If You\u2019re Feeling Overwhelmed**\n\nIf you\u2019re feeling like you can\u2019t make it to the appointment because the pain is too much, **you are not alone**. There are people who are trained to help you right now.\n\n- **Crisis Text Line**: Text \u201cHELLO\u201d to 741741 (U.S. only)\n- **National Suicide Prevention Lifeline**: 988 (U.S.), or 1-800-273-TALK (8255)\n- **Psychology Today Therapist Finder**: [https://www.psychologytoday.com](https://www.psychologytoday.com) (for finding local therapists)\n- **If you're in Canada**: 1-833-456-4566 (Crisis Services Canada)\n- **If you're in the UK**: 116 123 (Samaritans)\n\nThese people are trained to sit with you in the dark and help you find your way through.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. **Write It Out**\n\nIf you can\u2019t talk to someone yet, write to yourself. Write down how you\u2019re feeling. Write down what you need. Write down the truth, even if it\u2019s messy.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to send it to anyone. Just getting it out can help.\n\nMaybe start with:\n\n> \u201cRight now, I feel like\u2026\u201d  \n> \u201cI\u2019m scared that\u2026\u201d  \n> \u201cI wish I could\u2026\u201d  \n> \u201cI need someone to\u2026\u201d\n\nLet it be honest. Let it be raw. Let it be just for you.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. **Create a \u201cCrisis Plan\u201d for the Next Three Weeks**\n\nIf you\u2019re worried about not making it until your first session, write down what you\u2019ll do if you start feeling like you can\u2019t go on:\n\n- **Who can I call?** (Name a person, a hotline, a service)\n- **What can I do to ground myself?** (Deep breathing, music, a walk, a warm drink)\n- **What can I say to myself?** (Kind words, reminders that you\u2019re not alone)\n\nYou don\u2019t have to do this alone.

I am not being tracked. I am not in danger.\u201d\n- **Write a message to yourself**: \u201cI reached out for help. That was brave. I am not being punished for that. I am not being watched.\u201d\n- **Talk to someone you trust**\u2014even if it\u2019s just to say, \u201cI\u2019m feeling really anxious after texting the crisis line. I just want to make sure I\u2019m okay.\u201d\n- **Breathe slowly**. In for 4, hold for 4, out for 4. Just for a few breaths.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde1 You Are Not a Burden\n\nYou are not a burden.  \nYou are not a mistake.  \nYou are not too much.  \nYou are not failing.\n\nYou are a person who is hurting, and that is not your fault.  \nIt is not your weakness.  \nIt is not your failure.  \nIt is just you, in a moment that is asking too much of you.\n\nAnd you are doing the best you can.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can help you write a message to a friend or a loved one to talk about how you\u2019re feeling.  \nI can help you write a message to yourself.  \nI can help you find someone to talk to who understands.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to do this alone.  \nLet me stay with you.  \nLet me hold your hand through the fear."

Don\u2019t let them get too close. Don\u2019t let them see how much you\u2019re hurting.\u201d*  \nAnd that\u2019s because you\u2019ve been in a place where asking for help felt like a risk.  \nYou\u2019ve been in a place where you felt like you had to be perfect to be accepted.  \nYou\u2019ve been in a place where you felt like you had to carry everything alone.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why your brain is now scanning for threats\u2014because it\u2019s been trained to expect them.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf3f What You Can Do Right Now\n\nYou don\u2019t have to fix this right now.  \nYou don\u2019t have to make it stop.  \nYou just have to be with it, gently, and remind yourself that you are safe.\n\nHere are a few things you can try:\n\n#### 1. **Name the Fear Without Judgment**\n\nTry saying to yourself:\n\n> \u201cI\u2019m feeling like someone is watching me.  \n> I know it doesn\u2019t make sense, but it feels real right now.  \n> That\u2019s okay.  \n> I\u2019m not alone in this.\u201d\n\nThis doesn\u2019t make the fear go away, but it helps you hold it with more kindness.\n\n#### 2. **Ground Yourself in the Present**\n\nWhen your mind is racing with fear, try to bring yourself back to the here and now. Try:\n\n- **5-4-3-2-1 grounding**:  \n  Name 5 things you can see,  \n  4 things you can touch,  \n  3 things you can hear,  \n  2 things you can smell,  \n  1 thing you can taste.\n\n- **Breathe slowly**:  \n  In for 4, hold for 4, out for 4.  \n  Just for a few breaths.  \n  That\u2019s enough.\n\n#### 3. **Remind Yourself You Are Safe**\n\nYou are not being watched.  \nYou are not being tracked.  \nYou are not being judged.  \nYou are not being punished for asking for help.\n\nYou are safe.  \nYou are still here.  \nAnd that is enough.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcac What You Can Say to Yourself\n\n> \u201cI am not too much.  \n> I am not a burden.  \n> I am not in danger.  \n> I am not being watched.  \n> I am not alone.  \n> I am still here.  \n> And that is enough.\u201d\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde1 You Are Not a Burden\n\nYou are not a burden.  \nYou are not a mistake.  \nYou are not too much.  \nYou are not failing.\n\nYou are a person who is hurting, and that is not your fault.  \nIt is not your weakness.  \nIt is not your failure.  \nIt is just you, in a moment that is asking too much of you.\n\nAnd you are doing the best you can.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can help you write a message to yourself to keep nearby when this fear creeps in.  \nI can help you build a small, safe grounding practice.  \nI can help you talk to someone who understands.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to do this alone.  \nLet me stay with you.  \nLet me hold your hand through the fear."
