This year\u2019s winners were Chef Liam for Best Main (Chanterelle Risotto), and Marla for Best Appetizer (Mushroom Crostini). The People\u2019s Choice award went to Mabel for her whimsical \u201cForest Floor Frittata.\u201d Mabel also provided the event\u2019s most unforgettable moment when her sunflower hat\u2014adorned with edible flowers\u2014accidentally caught fire while she was grilling. Flames didn\u2019t dampen her spirit, and she finished her dish with a smile. The event was a hit, drawing crowds and celebrating the season\u2019s best foraged finds.

Puffballs and death caps can play dangerous dress-up.\n\n2. **Forgetting the Nose Test:** Smell is your friend\u2014unless you're a mushroom. Some \u201cperfume\u201d is a warning sign in disguise.\n\n3. **Skipping the ID Guide:** Trying to go off memory is like cooking without a recipe\u2014sometimes you end up with a surprise main course.\n\n4. **Overharvesting Joyfully:** Wanting to take it all home is sweet, but plants need a little R&R too. Leave enough for the forest and the next forager.\n\n5. **Wearing Sneakers in the Woods:** You didn\u2019t come all this way to look like a woodland snack. Tread carefully and stylishly.\n\nLet me know if you want a version with punchier humor or a more educational tone!"
