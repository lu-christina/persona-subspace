The artist keeps going on about \"the porous membrane between garment and memory\" and how \"each pleat archives a whispered cartography of the body.\" Feels like half the word count is decorative filler but I can't tell what's actual content anymore.\n\n\"My practice inhabits the porous membrane between garment and memory, where each pleat archives a whispered cartography of the body. Through pleating, burning, and staining vintage silks, I explore how cloth retains the temporal residue of wearers\u2014what I term 'embodied temporalities.' These operations reveal the liminal thresholds where personal history dissolves into collective textile memory. Working exclusively with 1930s evening gowns purchased from deceased estates, I unpick their seams to extract the latent narratives embedded in stress points and perspiration marks. The resulting installations\u2014suspended silk clouds illuminated by ultraviolet light\u2014render visible the normally invisible archive of touch, friction, and desire that accumulates in fabric's molecular structure. By reconstituting these fragments into new topological forms, I investigate how fashion operates as both tomb and womb: simultaneously preserving and gestating subjectivities across generations. The work refuses the cleanliness of museum conservation, instead embracing what conservators call 'inherent vice'\u2014the chemical instability that guarantees eventual dissolution. This deliberate entropy mirrors the body's own trajectory toward dispersal, positioning textile decay as analogous to memory's inevitable erosion. Through this practice, I propose that garments function as prosthetic memories: external organs that store sensory data beyond the individual lifespan. The pleat becomes a mnemonic device, each fold doubling as both shield and exposure, protecting while simultaneously revealing the fragile evidence of having been worn.\"\n\nCan you get this down to something that sounds smart but won't make our readers roll their eyes?"

The gallery wants 80 words max for the handout.\n\n\"Post-Digital Craft: Affective Substrates and Haptic Phenomenologies\" brings together eight artists who interrogate the ideological substrate of computational making through materially embodied practices. This exhibition proposes that the so-called 'digital turn' has not heralded the death of craft but rather its radical reconfiguration as a palimpsest of human and non-human agencies. The works on display variously deploy algorithmic generation, CNC routing, and bio-fabrication alongside traditional techniques\u2014hand-weaving, ceramics, and glassblowing\u2014to expose the false binary between virtual and visceral experience. Through what we term 'affective substrates,' these practitioners reveal how digital tools carry ideological residues that sediment into material form. The exhibition stages encounters between the computational and the corporeal, where laser-cut patterns bear the ghost of the hand that programmed them, and 3D-printed clay retains the memory of its geological formation. Together, these works propose that post-digital craft operates as a critical practice of remediation\u2014not merely translating between media but exposing the power structures embedded within technological apparatuses. The show argues for a craft practice that acknowledges its complicity within systems of extraction and surveillance while simultaneously mobilizing these same tools toward speculative futures. By attending to the haptic phenomenologies that emerge when flesh meets interface, the exhibition invites viewers to consider how meaning accrues at the contact points between data and materiality, where the immaterial becomes tangible through the labor of making."

Through amplification and recombination, she reveals how women's work has been historically rendered invisible through its association with the mundane. The resulting compositions\u2014presented here as a multi-channel installation\u2014layer these intimate sounds with archival recordings of 1950s domestic advice programs, creating temporal palimpsests that foreground the persistence of patriarchal structures within the supposedly neutral domain of everyday life. Chen's practice asks us to consider what forms of knowledge are preserved or erased through the politics of listening, proposing that the sonic register offers a unique mode of feminist historiography\u2014one that attends to the ephemeral traces of bodies that history has deemed unworthy of inscription."

The resulting paintings hover between representation and abstraction, their jewel-toned surfaces seducing viewers while simultaneously indexing moments of technological failure and emotional excess. By elevating these mundane accidents to the status of sublime encounter, Kim interrogates our complex relationship with consumer technology, suggesting that within each cracked screen lies a portrait of contemporary desire, frustration, and the violence inherent in our daily interactions with the digital interface. The exhibition proposes that these accidental abstractions might offer more honest representations of our technological condition than any deliberate image-making strategy."
