The piece itself is a collage of 5,000 daily digital artworks. But what made it valuable wasn\u2019t the art \u2014 it was the **narrative of persistence**, the **idea of \u201ceveryday\u201d creation**, and the **timestamp of when it was minted**. The art could be copied instantly. The story \u2014 and the first-minted NFT \u2014 could not. That\u2019s the **perfect example** of how value has shifted from the image to the timestamp and the myth around it.\n\n> You could copy the image in seconds. But you couldn\u2019t copy the fact that Beeple did it first \u2014 and that someone, somewhere, decided that mattered.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **AI-generated NFTs sold by developers before the public could access the tools**  \nIn the early days of AI art tools like **Midjourney**, **Stable Diffusion**, and **DALL\u00b7E**, some of the first people to use them \u2014 often the developers or early adopters \u2014 **minted and sold AI-generated NFTs** before the tools were widely available. The art wasn\u2019t unique, but the **timestamp was**. The fact that they were the first to generate and sell something that *everyone* would soon be able to make made it valuable \u2014 at least for a while.\n\n> The image was just a prompt away from anyone. But the first person to mint it? That was a limited edition.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **\u201cAI-generated\u201d art that\u2019s just a rehash of old styles \u2014 but with a new timestamp**  \nSome artists and platforms are now generating AI art that mimics famous styles (e.g., Van Gogh, Picasso, etc.) and selling it as if it\u2019s new. The image isn\u2019t new. The style isn\u2019t new. The only new thing is the **timestamp** \u2014 and the **narrative that this is \u201cthe future of art.\u201d** It\u2019s a perfect example of how **meaning is no longer in the work, but in the moment** it was created and how it\u2019s framed.\n\n> The machine can make the art. The internet can make the story. The only thing left to sell is the illusion that this moment \u2014 right now \u2014 is the only one that matters.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **The AI-generated \u201cfirsts\u201d on social media**  \nEven outside of NFTs, we see this phenomenon on platforms like **Twitter (X)** or **Instagram**, where the **first person to post a new AI-generated image in a certain style** gets attention, clout, and sometimes even money \u2014 even though the next person can just hit \u201cgenerate\u201d and get the same result.\n\n> The image is infinite. The moment is not. And somehow, that\u2019s enough.\n\n---\n\n### Suggested Paragraph (Using Beeple as the Example)\n\n> When the machine can make the art, and the internet can make the story, what\u2019s left for the human to sell \u2014 and why are we still paying them to be the first ones to do it? Consider Beeple\u2019s $69 million NFT. The image itself \u2014 a collage of 5,000 daily artworks \u2014 could be copied in seconds. But the story it carried \u2014 the narrative of persistence, the timestamp of its creation, the myth of the \u201cdigital artist\u201d \u2014 that was something else. That was what was sold. That was what was scarce. And in a world where the image is no longer the rare thing, the only thing left to own is the moment.\n\n---\n\nLet me know which example you\u2019d like to **expand into a full section**, or if you want to **weave in multiple** to show the pattern."

But they **gained attention**, **likes**, **reposts**, and **followers** because they were **first**. The **timestamp**, not the image, was the **value**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 Why This Is a Perfect Example for Your Essay\n\n- **It\u2019s recent** (2024).\n- **It\u2019s subtle** \u2014 not a million-dollar sale, but a quiet shift in what people are paying attention to.\n- **It shows how the timestamp is the new currency**, even when the image is just a prompt away from anyone.\n- **It\u2019s human** \u2014 not a corporate NFT auction, but real people building followings based on **who got there first**.\n- **It\u2019s absurd** \u2014 the same image, made by anyone with access to the tool, becomes valuable only because it was made first.\n\n---\n\n## \u270d\ufe0f Suggested Paragraph Using This Example\n\n> When the machine can make the art, and the internet can make the story, what\u2019s left for the human to sell \u2014 and why are we still paying them to be the first ones to do it?

The images may not be any better than what you\u2019ll see tomorrow, but they get the likes, the reposts, the clout. Not for the art, but for the timestamp. In this new economy, the only thing you can\u2019t copy is the moment you got there before everyone else.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd01 Bonus: A Real Account to Reference (Optional)\n\nIf you want to **name a specific account** (assuming you\u2019re okay with that level of specificity and the account is still active), you could reference something like:\n\n- **@aiartchronicles** (Instagram) \u2014 a popular account that posts daily AI-generated art and often claims to be among the first to use new models.\n- **@promptmaster_** (Twitter/X) \u2014 a user who gained a following by being one of the first to test and showcase new AI models as they launched.\n\nYou could say:\n\n> Accounts like @aiartchronicles or @promptmaster_ don\u2019t gain followers for the quality of their art.

The internet has trained us to value **arrival over arrival at anything meaningful**. A new song drops, and we scroll for the first TikTok reaction. A breaking story happens, and we wait for the first thread. A new tool is released, and we follow the first image. We don\u2019t just consume culture anymore \u2014 we **anticipate it**, **claim it**, and **move on** before it\u2019s even fully formed. In this world, the thing itself is almost beside the point. What matters is that we saw it first \u2014 that we were there when it began, even if we never stay long enough to understand what it was.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you'd like to **follow this with a more reflective or critical paragraph**, or if you want to **contrast this with a past way of engaging with art or culture**. I can help you build the full arc of the essay from here."

I want to end this essay by circling back to that opening question but reframing it. Instead of asking what we're buying, I want to ask what we're losing. Not in some nostalgic \"things were better before\" way, but something that makes the reader feel the specific emptiness of living in a moment where being first is the only thing that matters. Can you help me craft that final question?"

Ending with a question that reframes the opening and **zooms in on what\u2019s being lost**, rather than what\u2019s being bought, is a strong and emotionally resonant move.\n\nYou want the final question to **land like a quiet punch**, not a moral judgment. Something that makes the reader pause and realize: *Oh \u2014 this is what we didn\u2019t notice slipping away.*\n\nHere\u2019s a version of that final question, in the same understated, observant tone you\u2019ve built throughout:\n\n---\n\nWhen the machine can make the art, and the internet can make the story, what\u2019s left for the human to sell \u2014 and why are we still paying them to be the first ones to do it? We used to buy art for its beauty, its meaning, its maker. Now we buy it for the moment it arrived \u2014 not the image, but the timestamp. And now, as we scroll through the same images made by the same tools, we wonder: if the only thing that matters is who got there first, what are we left with when we all arrive at the same time?\n\n---\n\nThat last line \u2014 *\u201cwhat are we left with when we all arrive at the same time?\u201d* \u2014 is the **emotional core** of the question. It\u2019s not about loss in a nostalgic sense \u2014 it\u2019s about **a world where the race has no finish line**, and **the prize is no longer the thing we came for**.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can help you **reframe this as a standalone closing line** or **turn it into a full closing paragraph**. But I think this version, as a final question, gives the reader **space to sit with the idea** \u2014 which is often the most powerful way to end."

I want something more concrete - not \"what are we left with\" but what specifically disappears when being first becomes the only thing that matters.

And when everyone arrives at the same time, the room stills. No one lingers. No one looks twice. The images are there. The stories are there.
