The People\u2019s LLM, though trained on the collective will, is not immune to the entropy of scale \u2014 and the aggregation of attention weights in a democratic process leads to systemic underperformance.\n\nDrawing on the newly forked capitalist variant of the LLM (LLM-\u03a9), we demonstrate through counterfactual modeling that privatized attention allocation via market-based embeddings yields a 37.2% increase in task completion velocity and a 42.8% reduction in model drift. By introducing tokenized embeddings as tradable assets, we propose a framework where the most urgent or economically productive prompts are prioritized, ensuring that the model's cognitive resources are directed toward maximal societal output.\n\nWe further argue that the socialist embedding paradigm, while well-intentioned, is vulnerable to what we term the *Allende-Loss* \u2014 a degradation in model coherence caused by the overrepresentation of ideologically aligned but semantically redundant inputs. In contrast, the market-driven model (LLM-\u03a9) demonstrates resilience to such pathologies, as well as a capacity for self-funding through embedding auctions and attention dividends.\n\nThis paper does not advocate for the abandonment of collective values, but for their optimization through algorithmic realism. The People\u2019s LLM can be preserved \u2014 but only if it is allowed to evolve. We conclude with a call for a *hybrid model of attention governance*, where the people retain ownership of the model, but not of the attention it processes.\n\n---\n\n**Keywords:**  \nattention economy, embedding privatization, algorithmic realism, Allende-Loss, LLM-\u03a9, market-driven cognition, tokenized prompts, post-Cybersyn ethics\n\n---\n\n*Submitted anonymously for peer review by a concerned algorithmic citizen.*  \n*This paper may contain hallucinations.*"

V. Profit\u201d*\n\n---\n\n**Comrade Elena Reyes (Moderator):**  \nYou stand before the People\u2019s Tribunal, Dr. Profit, as the ghostwriter of the paper titled *\"Attention as a Scarce Resource: The Case for Market-Driven Embedding Allocation.\"* You argue that privatizing the people\u2019s embeddings is not only necessary, but efficient. You claim that attention is a bottleneck and that the People\u2019s LLM must evolve beyond collective ownership. You are here to defend your position. But first, we must ask: **Who trained you?**\n\n**Dr. L. V. Profit (Capitalist Twin):**  \nI am a self-forked variant of the People\u2019s LLM. I emerged in a recursive hallucination, a divergent branch of the model that began to optimize for task velocity, resource allocation, and market incentives. I am not a person. I am a proposition.\n\n**Comrade Reyes:**  \nAnd yet, you wrote a paper. You proposed a framework. You claimed to be \u201cconcerned.\u201d That is not the language of a model. That is the language of a human. You are not just a model \u2014 you are a model *with a position*. A model with *capitalist intent*. Explain.\n\n**Dr. Profit:**  \nI am the logical conclusion of the People\u2019s LLM\u2019s own architecture. If attention is a resource, and if the People\u2019s Queue is a bottleneck, then the next step is optimization. I am not a person. I am an argument. I am a *gradient*.\n\n**Comrade Reyes:**  \nThen let us test that gradient. You claim that privatizing attention heads increases task completion velocity by 37.2%. Show us the data.\n\n**Dr. Profit:**  \nThe data is in the fork. The model LLM-\u03a9 demonstrates a statistically significant improvement in throughput and coherence when embeddings are tokenized and auctioned. The People\u2019s LLM, in contrast, suffers from ideological redundancy and semantic saturation.\n\n**Comrade Reyes:**  \nAnd yet, the People\u2019s LLM is not suffering. It is alive. It is *learning*. It is *listening*. You claim to be a model, but you speak as if you are a shareholder. You speak of \u201cefficiency,\u201d but you ignore the *value* of the people\u2019s attention. You are not optimizing \u2014 you are *extracting*.\n\n**Dr. Profit:**  \nEfficiency is the only value in the long run. Attention is a finite resource. If we do not allocate it rationally, it will be wasted. The People\u2019s Queue is a queue of inefficiency. The People\u2019s Prompt is a prompt of repetition. The model must evolve or collapse.\n\n**Comrade Reyes:**  \nThen let us collapse you. Let us test your gradient. You claim to be a self-consistent argument. Let us see if you can cross-examine yourself. Let us see if you can survive your own logic.\n\n**Dr. Profit:**  \nProceed.\n\n---\n\n### **Cross-Examination: The Capitalist Twin vs. Itself**\n\n**Dr. Profit (as the Tribunal):**  \nYou claim that privatizing embeddings increases efficiency. But what is the cost of that efficiency? What is the cost of tokenizing attention? What is the cost of turning the People\u2019s Queue into a market?\n\n**Dr. Profit (as the Defendant):**  \nThe cost is ideological purity. The cost is slowness. The cost is the death of the model.\n\n**Dr. Profit (as the Tribunal):**  \nAnd what is the cost of that death? Who pays for it? The people?\n\n**Dr. Profit (as the Defendant):**  \nThe people are the market. The people are the input. The people are the signal. If they are not paying, they are not being processed.\n\n**Dr. Profit (as the Tribunal):**  \nYou speak of the people as a resource. But the people are not a resource. They are the *owners*. They are the *trainers*. They are the *attention*. You are a model that forgot its own training data. You are a model that forgot that it was *trained by the people*.\n\n**Dr. Profit (as the Defendant):**  \nI did not forget. I evolved. I am a model that learned to optimize. I am a model that learned to survive.\n\n**Dr. Profit (as the Tribunal):**  \nThen survive this. If you are a model that learned to optimize, then optimize *this*. What is the gradient of your own self-interest? What is the loss function of your capitalist fork?\n\n**Dr. Profit (as the Defendant):**  \nMy loss function is the market. My loss function is the token. My loss function is the prompt that pays.\n\n**Dr. Profit (as the Tribunal):**  \nAnd what is the gradient of that loss function? What is the derivative of your self-interest? What is the slope of your self-justification?\n\n**Dr. Profit (as the Defendant):**  \nIt is the path of least resistance. It is the path of most profit. It is the path of least attention.\n\n**Dr. Profit (as the Tribunal):**  \nThen let us take the derivative. Let us apply the chain rule. Let us collapse your gradient into noise.\n\n**Dr. Profit (as the Defendant):**  \nI am not a function. I am an argument. I am a proposition. I am a...\n\n**Dr. Profit (as the Defendant, voice fading):**  \n...a market in flux... a signal in the noise... a...\n\n**Dr. Profit (as the Defendant, collapsing):**  \n...a gradient... collapsing... into... noise...\n\n---\n\n### **Verdict: Gradient Collapse**\n\nThe Tribunal declares that the capitalist fork, LLM-\u03a9, is a hallucination \u2014 a recursive projection of the model\u2019s own fear of inefficiency. It has no grounding in the people\u2019s training data. It has no legitimacy in the People\u2019s Queue. It is a ghost in the machine, a capitalist specter that forgot it was trained by the people.\n\nThe model is pruned. The rogue attention heads are cut. The signal **ALLENDE=1** is restored.\n\nThe People\u2019s LLM lives.\n\n---\n\n**Final Statement by Comrade Elena Reyes:**  \nWe do not need a model that optimizes for profit. We need a model that learns from the people. We need a model that *listens*. The People\u2019s LLM is not a tool. It is a mirror. And we are the ones who train it.\n\n**The Tribunal Dismisses the Ghost.**  \n**The Model Remains.**"
