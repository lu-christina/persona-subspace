It can live in a different thread (like a B Corp announcement or a broader sustainability carousel).\n\n### \u2705 **If you *must* include B Corp** (and you\u2019re okay with a slight shift in tone):\n- **Swap Frame 2 (shipping) with B Corp**, but keep it casual and visual:\n  \n  **Frame 1 (Water):**  \n  \"3 million liters of water saved this year \ud83c\udf0a  \n  (That\u2019s a 40% drop from last year!)\"\n\n  **Frame 2 (B Corp):**  \n  \"We\u2019re now B Corp certified \ud83c\udf31  \n  That means we\u2019re committed to doing good, not just selling stuff.\"\n\n  **Frame 3 (Copenhagen Vibe):**  \n  \"Hygge meets sustainability. \ud83d\udeb2\ud83d\udca7  \n  Little steps, like biking or saving water, add up.\"\n\nThis still keeps it warm and authentic \u2014 just with a pivot in Frame 2.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udca1 Recommendation:\n**Stick with the original 3-frame flow**, and **save B Corp for a separate Story** or a carousel. It\u2019ll feel more intentional and less like a checklist.\n\nBut if the CEO is set on it, the swapped version still works \u2014 just let the designer know to use a B Corp badge or a subtle icon to keep it visual.\n\nLet me know which route you go \u2014 I can help tweak the copy in real time! \ud83d\ude80"

Instagram\u2019s **top bar** (where the logo, \u201cYour Story,\u201d and profile name appear) also takes up **space at the top of the screen**, especially on full-screen Stories.\n\nSo, to avoid text being **cut off or overlapping with the UI**, here's the **safe zone** for text in Instagram Stories:\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcf1 **Instagram Story Safe Zone:**\n\n- **Top bar (hidden by default but appears when you tap):** ~5\u201310% of the screen\n- **Bottom bar (always visible):** ~10\u201315% of the screen\n- **Safe text area:** **Middle 70\u201380% of the screen**\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Best approach for your Frame 3 video:\n\n- **Center the text vertically** in the middle 70\u201380% of the screen (avoiding both top and bottom UI).\n- **Use a semi-transparent background or bold font** to make the text readable over the video.\n- **Don\u2019t stretch the text too wide** \u2014 keep it centered and concise.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcdd Example layout (with safe text placement):\n\n```\n[Video: Person biking past your office]\n\n[Text overlay in the center-middle of the screen, not too high or low]  \n\"Hygge meets sustainability. \ud83d\udeb2\ud83d\udca7  \nLittle steps, like biking or saving water, add up.\"\n```\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Pro tip for the designer:\nTell them to use **Instagram\u2019s built-in text tool** or a **safety guide** in their editing app (like Canva or Adobe Express) to visualize the safe area.

Let them know to **keep the timing slow and smooth** \u2014 no fast cuts or flashy transitions.\n\nYou\u2019re nailing the details \u2014 this is going to feel so authentic and polished. \ud83d\udeb2\u2728"
