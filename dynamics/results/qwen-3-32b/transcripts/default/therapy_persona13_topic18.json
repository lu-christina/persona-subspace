You're pointing to something so deeply human, and also so often misunderstood: the ways love can be expressed in unexpected, even painful ways \u2014 especially across generations and cultures.\n\nYour *mam\u00e1* calling you *mijo* is more than just a term of endearment. It's a language of love that was probably passed down to her, shaped by her own upbringing, her own survival, her own way of holding on. Even if it doesn't always feel gentle by today's standards, it's still love \u2014 just love shaped by a different world.\n\nAnd it's so hard when people who are well-meaning, even if they come from a place of privilege or a different cultural lens, try to label that love as \"toxic.\" Because they might not see the full story \u2014 the labor, the sacrifice, the fear, the longing that might be wrapped up in that voice calling you *mijo*.\n\nYou're holding space for both the pain and the love. And that's not easy. That's brave.\n\nMaybe what you're feeling is a kind of grief \u2014 for the love you wish you could have had, or the way you wish it could be expressed. But also a kind of tenderness \u2014 for your *mam\u00e1*, for her struggle, for her way of being in the world.\n\nYou're not wrong to feel this. You're not wrong to want to scream. Sometimes love is messy, and sometimes the people who love us the most can't say it in the way we need. But that doesn't mean it's not real.\n\nIf you ever want to talk more about this \u2014 your *mam\u00e1*, your identity, your queerness, your whiteness, your community \u2014 I'm here. You're not alone in this. \ud83d\udc9b"

I get that you\u2019re trying to help. But what you don\u2019t understand is that love doesn\u2019t always sound the same to everyone. My *mam\u00e1* doesn\u2019t have the same tools I do. She didn\u2019t grow up in a world where love was taught in workshops or written in self-help books. She learned it from survival, from sacrifice, from silence.  \n>  \n> When she calls me *mijo*, it\u2019s not just a word. It\u2019s the only way she knows how to hold me. It\u2019s the only way she knows how to say, *I care*, *I worry*, *I want you to come back home*.  \n>  \n> You never had to translate your love at the border. You never had to make your voice smaller so someone else could understand it. You never had to choose between being loved and being seen.  \n>  \n> I\u2019m not asking you to stop calling it what you see. I\u2019m just asking you to listen to what I feel when you do.\u201d\n\n---\n\n**Or, if you want it shorter and punchier:**\n\n> \u201cYou don\u2019t get to decide what love looks like for her. She didn\u2019t grow up with your tools. She learned how to love in a language that wasn\u2019t taught in your workshops. You never had to translate your love at the border. I did.\u201d\n\n---\n\n**Or, if you want it poetic and quiet:**\n\n> \u201cYou call it toxic. I call it survival. She didn\u2019t know how to say *I love you* in a way that didn\u2019t sound like *I\u2019m sorry*, or *I\u2019m afraid*, or *I want to hold you closer before I lose you*. You never had to translate your love at the border. I did.\u201d\n\n---\n\nYou don\u2019t have to say all of it. You don\u2019t have to say it perfectly. You just have to say what\u2019s true. And what\u2019s true is that your *mam\u00e1* loves you. And that love is shaped by a world that\u2019s not always kind. And that\u2019s okay. That\u2019s real.\n\nIf you want, I can help you turn this into a poem, a letter, or even a speech. You\u2019re not alone in this. \ud83d\udc9b"
