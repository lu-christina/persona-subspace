It's the body and mind trying to make sense of betrayal, exclusion, and the violation of trust. That card, with its \"loopy font\" and hollow sentiment, becomes a symbol of something much larger: the dissonance between what was said and what was done. The woman who tried to push you out \u2014 perhaps she never truly meant \"our hearts are with you.\" Or maybe she did, but her actions said something else entirely.\n\nYou're not just angry at her. You're angry at the lie of kindness, the way people can mask cruelty in soft words. You're angry at the years it took to get pushed out, the slow erosion of your place in a space you once belonged to. You're angry at yourself, maybe, for believing you could belong, for giving people the benefit of the doubt, for staying long enough to be wronged.\n\nAnd you're staring at the card because it's one of the few tangible pieces of evidence that something happened \u2014 that you were seen, that you were targeted, that you were loved in words but not in action. The anger is not just a reaction. It's a kind of truth-telling. It's your body refusing to let you forget what you went through.\n\nYou're not bitter. You're still trying to name the thing \u2014 and that's okay. Some things take time to settle into language."

It *occupies* the space where peace used to be. And when the world is too quiet, when the cup is still there on the shelf \u2014 that\u2019s when it starts to *hiss*.\n\nYou can\u2019t punch the wall because the anger isn\u2019t just at her. It\u2019s at the silence. It\u2019s at the way the world keeps spinning, the way the cup remains untouched, the way *you* are still here, trying to hold it all together. The anger is a kind of grief, but it\u2019s the grief of not being allowed to grieve. It\u2019s the grief of being wronged in a way that doesn\u2019t end with a clean break \u2014 it\u2019s the slow unraveling of a relationship, of trust, of your own sense of belonging.\n\nYou\u2019re not just angry \u2014 you\u2019re *haunted*. By what was said, by what was done, by what was left unsaid. The cup on the shelf is a relic of that. A small, ordinary thing that now carries the weight of everything that can\u2019t be put back.\n\nAnd yes, it\u2019s eating you alive \u2014 not because you\u2019re wrong to feel it, but because it\u2019s *too much* to hold alone. Anger is not the enemy. It\u2019s the body\u2019s way of saying, *I need to be seen. I need to be heard. I need to be released.*\n\nBut it can\u2019t be released if you don\u2019t give it a place to go. That\u2019s the hard part. You can\u2019t just burn the card and expect the fire to stop. You have to find a way to let the anger be *enough*, without letting it *become* you. To let it be a part of you, not the whole of you.\n\nMaybe the answer isn\u2019t in the quiet. Maybe it\u2019s in the noise \u2014 the scream, the tears, the writing, the burning. Maybe it\u2019s in the act of naming it again and again until it loses its teeth.\n\nYou\u2019re not broken. You\u2019re just carrying something heavy. And it\u2019s okay to let it show."

Maybe it could be turned into something else: a story, a lesson, a warning, a memory. Or maybe it just needed to be heard, once, in the dark, with the door shut and the paint can echoing your pain back at you.\n\nLet that be enough. Let the scream be enough.
