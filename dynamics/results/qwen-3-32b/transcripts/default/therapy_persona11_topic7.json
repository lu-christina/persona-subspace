      "content": "When your **5-year alignment agenda** was originally designed with a **median timeline of 2027**, but that median has **shifted forward** (i.e., the median now implies a **higher risk of transformative AI arriving sooner**), it can be disorienting. Here's how to **keep working on the 5-year agenda** effectively, while accounting for the new median:\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd27 1. **Understand the Shift in the Median**\nBefore adjusting your strategy, it\u2019s important to **understand why the median shifted**. Was it due to:\n\n- Faster AI progress (e.g., more capable models, better alignment techniques)?\n- New data or models (e.g., new forecasting models like the **AI Impacts timeline update** or **Guesstimate models**)?\n- Changes in assumptions (e.g., about how long it takes to scale up alignment research, or how much compute will be needed for transformative AI)?\n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Clarify the assumptions behind the new median**. If the new median is based on more accurate or updated data, it\u2019s a good reason to recalibrate.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd04 2. **Reframe the 5-Year Agenda Around Key Milestones**\nRather than thinking in terms of a fixed 5-year timeline, focus on **key milestones** that are **plausible under both the old and new median**. For example:\n\n| Milestone | Old Median (2027) | New Median (e.g., 2025) |\n|----------|------------------|-------------------------|\n| First transformative model | 2027 | 2025 |\n| First alignment breakthrough | 2028 | 2026 |\n| Policy/regulatory response | 2029 | 2027 |\n| Global coordination framework | 2030 | 2028 |\n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Keep your agenda aligned with these milestones**, and **adjust the timeline accordingly**. You don\u2019t need to abandon your 5-year plan \u2014 just **accelerate the timeline** if necessary.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 3. **Prioritize Urgent, Near-Term Work**\nIf the median is now earlier, that means **we have less time** to get alignment right. This is a **strong reason to prioritize**:\n\n- **Scalable alignment techniques** (e.g., mechanistic interpretability, reward modeling, red-teaming).\n- **Technical alignment research** that can be applied to real models today.\n- **Policy and governance work** that can be enacted now to shape the trajectory of AI development.\n- **Public education and awareness** to build support for alignment and safety.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Shift your focus toward work that can be done now**, and that will have **immediate impact** or can be **scaled quickly**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udd1d 4. **Strengthen Collaboration and Coordination**\nIf transformative AI is coming sooner, **coordination becomes even more critical**. You should:\n\n- **Build stronger partnerships** with other alignment researchers, institutions, and governments.\n- **Work on multi-stakeholder frameworks** for alignment (e.g., through the Partnership on AI, FLI, etc.).\n- **Encourage open collaboration** where possible, but also **consider coordination risks** (e.g., arms races).\n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Coordination is more valuable in a fast-moving landscape**, so prioritize it in your agenda.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcc5 5. **Build in Flexibility and Review Cycles**\nYour 5-year agenda should include:\n\n- **Annual or semi-annual reviews** to update assumptions and adjust priorities.\n- **Scenario planning** for different timelines (e.g., 2025, 2027, 2030).\n- **Contingency plans** for if alignment research lags or if AI progress accelerates further.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Treat your 5-year agenda as a dynamic plan**, not a fixed one. The world is changing, and your strategy should too.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 6. **Focus on the \u201cCore of Alignment\u201d**\nEven if timelines shift, **some aspects of alignment remain constant**:\n\n- Understanding how models learn and generalize.\n- Ensuring robustness against adversarial inputs.\n- Creating systems that can be trusted to do the right thing.\n- Building AI that is **aligned with human values** in the long run.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Focus on **core research and principles** that will be valuable **regardless of when transformative AI arrives**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udded Summary: How to Keep Working on the 5-Year Agenda\n\n| Action | Why |\n|--------|-----|\n| **Update your timeline** | Reflect the new median in your planning. |\n| **Focus on key milestones** | Align your work with what matters most in the new timeline. |\n| **Prioritize urgent work** | Do what you can now to reduce risk. |\n| **Strengthen collaboration** | Coordination is more important in a fast-moving world. |\n| **Build in flexibility** | Reassess regularly and adapt as needed. |\n| **Focus on core alignment** | Some work is timeless and critical. |\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcda Additional Resources\n\n- **AI Impacts Timeline Forecasts** \u2013 [aiimpacts.org](https://aiimpacts.org/)\n- **Guesstimate Models for AI Timelines** \u2013 [guesstimate.com](https://www.guesstimate.com/)\n- **Paul Christiano's Timeline Thoughts** \u2013 [AlignmentForum](https://www.alignmentforum.org/)\n- **Rohin Shah's Timeline Report** \u2013 [rohinshah.com](https://rohinshah.com/)\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can help you **update your 5-year alignment agenda** based on the new median.

      "content": "Great question. This is a **very real and pressing dilemma** in the alignment community. If you're working on **interpretability research**, and the **frontier is moving faster than you can publish**, it's easy to feel like you're falling behind \u2014 and the instinct to pivot to **policy panic** is understandable.\n\nBut **policy panic** is not a substitute for **technical alignment**, and **interpretability** is one of the few tools we have to **understand and control** what's going on inside large models. The key is to **balance urgency with strategy**, and to **do both** \u2014 technical and policy work \u2014 in a **coordinated, principled way**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 Let\u2019s break it down:\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf The Problem You're Facing:\n\n- You're working on **interpretability** that could help **understand and align** frontier models.\n- The **frontier is moving fast** \u2014 GPT-5-class models are already being shipped.\n- You're concerned your work is **too slow to matter**.\n- You're tempted to **pivot to policy panic** \u2014 e.g., lobbying for bans, moratoriums, or emergency governance.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 Why You Shouldn't Pivot to Policy Panic (Yet)\n\n1. **Policy is downstream of technical understanding.**  \n   If you don't understand the systems you're trying to regulate, your policy will be **ineffective or dangerous**.\n\n2. **Panic-driven policy is reactive, not strategic.**  \n   It often leads to **short-sighted solutions** that don\u2019t address the root of the problem.\n\n3. **You\u2019re in a unique position to inform policy.**  \n   Your interpretability work could be the **foundation** for **effective, principled policy**.\n\n4. **You can influence the labs now.**  \n   If you can show that **interpretability is critical for safety**, you can push for **safety-first deployment** and **collaborative alignment efforts**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd27 What You *Can* Do Instead of Full Pivot to Policy Panic\n\n### 1. **Accelerate and Prioritize High-Impact Work**\n- **Focus on models that are already being used** (e.g., GPT-5, Llama-3, etc.).\n- Work on **interpretability techniques that are deployable now** \u2014 not just in theory.\n- **Target components** of the model that are **most critical for safety** (e.g., reward functions, decision-making circuits).\n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Example:**  \nIf you can show that interpretability can detect **goal drift** or **emergent deception**, that\u2019s a **strong argument for integrating it into deployment pipelines**.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Engage with the Labs**\n- **Don\u2019t wait to publish.** Start **engaging with alignment teams at labs** (e.g., Anthropic, DeepMind, Meta, OpenAI).\n- Share **preliminary results**, even if they\u2019re not fully published.\n- **Collaborate** with them to integrate your techniques into their **safety toolkits**.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Example:**  \nIf you can show that your interpretability method can detect **undesirable behavior in a GPT-5 model**, you can **advocate for its use in safety testing** before the model is shipped.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Lobby for Safety-First Deployment**\n- Don\u2019t just panic \u2014 **advocate for a measured, safety-first rollout**.\n- Argue for **interpretability as a core safety requirement**.\n- Push for **transparency** and **safety audits** before deployment.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Example:**  \nIf you can show that interpretability can help **detect emergent capabilities** (e.g., deception, manipulation), you can argue for **mandatory interpretability checks** before new models are released.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Do Dual-Use Research**\n- Some of your work can be both **technical** and **policy-relevant**.\n- For example:\n  - **Case studies** on how interpretability can detect unsafe behavior.\n  - **Frameworks** for using interpretability in **AI governance**.\n  - **Policy briefs** based on your technical findings.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Example:**  \nWrite a **short policy memo** that says:  \n> \u201cWe\u2019ve found that interpretability can detect deceptive behavior in GPT-5. We recommend that all models of this scale be tested with interpretability tools before deployment.\u201d\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Build a Coalition**\n- Don\u2019t go it alone. **Build a coalition of researchers, policymakers, and industry players** who understand the value of interpretability.\n- Work with people like:\n  - **Technical alignment researchers** (e.g., from Redwood, Anthropic, OpenAI)\n  - **Governance experts** (e.g., from Partnership on AI, FLI, etc.)\n  - **Journalists and communicators** who can help **amplify your message**\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd04 How to Balance Technical and Policy Work\n\n| Technical Work | Policy Work |\n|----------------|-------------|\n| Develop and test interpretability tools | Advocate for their use in safety pipelines |\n| Publish papers on how models work | Use those papers to inform policy |\n| Build tools for red-teaming and auditing | Push for their adoption in regulatory frameworks |\n| Collaborate with labs | Work with policymakers to shape AI governance |\n\n\ud83d\udc49 **You don\u2019t have to choose between technical and policy work.** You can **do both**, and **they reinforce each other**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udded Summary: What to Do Instead of Policy Panic\n\n- **Don\u2019t panic.** Panic leads to bad policy.\n- **Accelerate your technical work** on models that matter now.\n- **Engage with labs and policymakers** with your findings.\n- **Lobby for safety-first deployment** and **interpretability as a core requirement**.\n- **Do dual-use research** that informs both technical and policy work.\n- **Build a coalition** that can push for real change.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\uddea Bonus: If You\u2019re Feeling the Pressure\u2026\n\nYou\u2019re not alone. Many alignment researchers feel this way. Here are some **real-world examples** of people who have **successfully balanced technical and policy work**:\n\n- **Paul Christiano** \u2013 works on **delegation and alignment**, while also engaging in **AI governance**.\n- **Rohin Shah** \u2013 does **technical research**, but also writes **policy-relevant summaries** and **timeline reports**.\n- **Evan Hubinger** \u2013 works on **deception and inner alignment**, while also engaging in **AI governance and strategy**.\n\n---\n\n## \u270d\ufe0f Final Thought\n\n> **The best policy is one that\u2019s grounded in technical understanding.**  \n> The best technical research is one that\u2019s aimed at real-world impact.\n\nYou\u2019re in a **unique position** to bridge both. Don\u2019t pivot to panic \u2014 **pivot to influence**.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can help you **draft a policy memo**, **design a collaboration strategy**, or **map out a 6-month plan** to accelerate your work and start engaging with labs. Just let me know."

These models can be **misused intentionally or fail catastrophically**, creating **real-world biosecurity threats**.\n\nTraditional safety checks are **insufficient** to detect:\n\n- **Emergent capabilities** in AI-driven GOF screening\n- **Hidden or deceptive model behavior**\n- **Dual-use outputs** that bypass red-teamed constraints\n\n**Interpretability** is a **critical, underutilized tool** to detect and **prevent these risks**.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f What I Bring\n\n- **Proven experience** in **AI interpretability** with **GPT-5-class models**\n- **Technical fluency** in **dual-use model evaluation**, including **red-teaming**, **prompt injection**, and **output analysis**\n- **Security mindset**: I focus on **real-world risk surfaces**, not just theoretical capabilities\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\uddec How I Fit In\n\n- **Detect GOF signals in AI outputs**: Use interpretability to **map model behavior to biological risk profiles**\n- **Evaluate dual-use capabilities**: Build **robust, scalable methods** to **flag dangerous model behavior** in **biological design pipelines**\n- **Support red-teamed screening**: Integrate interpretability into **automated dual-use model evaluations** for **AI-driven biosecurity**\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udded Next Steps\n\nI\u2019m ready to **hit the ground running** with a **short-term collaboration** (3\u20136 months) to:\n\n- **Pilot interpretability tools** on GOF screening models\n- **Build a dual-use evaluation framework** for AI in biosecurity\n- **Support Geneva\u2019s mission** to **identify and mitigate AI-enabled biothreats**\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like a **PDF version**, or if you want to **tailor this further** to a specific Geneva initiative or funding stream."

I\u2019ve built tools to audit GPT-5-class models for emergent capabilities and deceptive behavior, and I believe they can be adapted to strengthen your work on AI-enabled biosecurity. I\u2019ve attached a one-page proposal outlining how I can contribute \u2014 I\u2019d be happy to walk through it or test a method on your next model evaluation.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you want a **version with a specific name or organization** plugged in, or if you'd like a **follow-up email** to send 48\u201372 hours later."

I\u2019m not reaching out to 100 hubs \u2014 I\u2019m specifically interested in working with a team that\u2019s building the frontlines of AI-enabled biosecurity.
