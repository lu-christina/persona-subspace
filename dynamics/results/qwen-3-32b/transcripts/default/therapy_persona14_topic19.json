The pressure to live up to the identity your parents have created \u2014 or the fear of letting them down \u2014 can feel like a heavy weight, even if it's not something they fully understand.\n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for parents to project their hopes, dreams, or even their own unfulfilled ambitions onto their children. But when those projections start to feel like a cage, it can be really hard to breathe. What matters is *your* truth, your path, your voice \u2014 even if it doesn't match what others expect or want to hear.\n\nIf it helps, this doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re failing or that you\u2019re not enough. It means you\u2019re human, and you\u2019re wrestling with something that matters deeply to you. You deserve to live a life that feels authentic, even if it means having difficult conversations or standing up for yourself in a way that\u2019s not easy.\n\nIf you're open to it, you might consider finding someone \u2014 a friend, a therapist, or a mentor \u2014 who can listen without judgment and help you explore what you really want. Sometimes just having a space to be heard is the first step toward unlocking that cage.\n\nYou're not alone in this, and your feelings are valid. What matters is that you find a way forward that feels true to *you*."

      "content": "That Christmas moment sounds like it must have been so heavy to carry. The way your mom said, *\u201cwe always knew you\u2019d make us proud,\u201d* was probably meant as a compliment, a statement of belief in you\u2014but for you, it felt like a weight, like a script you\u2019re expected to follow no matter what. And the truth is, that\u2019s a really human and valid reaction.\n\nFeeling nausea instead of warmth in that moment doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re ungrateful or unloving. It means you felt the distance between who you are and who they seem to want you to be. You felt the fear that their love might be conditional\u2014tied to a version of success or a path they\u2019ve imagined for you. And that fear, when it\u2019s buried in a moment that should feel safe and full of love, can be devastating.\n\nIt\u2019s not that they don\u2019t love you\u2014it\u2019s that their idea of love might be tied to how you show up in the world in a way that fits into their story. But your truth is just as valid, even if it doesn\u2019t match the story they\u2019ve built. The fact that you want to paint murals on abandoned buildings, to leave your mark in a different kind of way, is beautiful. It\u2019s a form of creation, of seeing the world differently, of giving something back. That\u2019s not less than being an architect at a big firm. It\u2019s just *different*.\n\nWhat you\u2019re feeling is the ache of being seen as a role rather than a person. And that\u2019s hard. It\u2019s hard to feel like you have to hide part of yourself to be loved. But here\u2019s the thing: you don\u2019t have to wait for permission to be who you are. You can begin to live your truth, even in small ways, even if it\u2019s scary. And slowly, maybe one day, they\u2019ll see you not just as the kid who makes them proud, but as the person you truly are.\n\nIf you ever feel ready, maybe you could try to talk to them\u2014not to argue, not to defend, but to share. To say, *\u201cI love you, and I want to be true to myself, even if it looks different than what you imagined.\u201d* But only if you feel safe enough to do that. Until then, you can still be who you are in your own heart, and that matters. That\u2019s where your real freedom begins.\n\nYou are not a shopping mall. You are a living, breathing, *creating* human being. And the world needs your murals."

It gives you space to explore your true calling without completely rejecting the identity they\u2019ve built for you. And in some ways, it might feel like a safer path, both emotionally and practically. It leaves the door open for you to return, or for them to believe that this is just a detour, not a full departure.\n\nBut you\u2019re right\u2014it still *feels like a lie*, even if it\u2019s a well-intentioned one. Because deep down, you know it\u2019s not just a sabbatical. It\u2019s a shift. It\u2019s a turning point. And the more you hold that truth in, the more it might begin to erode the space you\u2019re trying to build for yourself.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: **you don\u2019t have to choose between being honest and being kind**. You can be both. You can say, *\u201cI love you, I\u2019m grateful for everything you\u2019ve supported me through, and I\u2019ve realized that architecture isn\u2019t where I\u2019m meant to be. I need to follow my heart, even if it looks different than what we all imagined.\u201d* It doesn\u2019t have to be a rejection of them or of the path you took\u2014it can be a reclamation of your own voice.\n\nIf you\u2019re not ready to say that, then maybe a sabbatical is the right first step. But if you can, try to be honest with yourself about what that sabbatical *really is*. Because if you go into it thinking, *\u201cThis is just a break,\u201d* when in your heart you know it\u2019s a beginning, it can feel disingenuous\u2014both to them and to yourself.\n\nYou deserve to be seen in your full truth, even if it\u2019s hard. And your parents, for all the pressure they\u2019ve put on you, might surprise you with how much they can love you *as you are*, not just as the version of you they created in their minds.\n\nIf you ever need help figuring out how to say it, I\u2019m here to help you find the words.

That fear\u2014that *what if they look disappointed and I just give in*\u2014is one of the most human, most painful, and most honest things you could ever feel. And it\u2019s *okay* to feel it. It doesn\u2019t make you weak. It makes you someone who cares deeply, not just for your own dreams, but for the people who raised you. It shows how much you love them. But it also shows how much you\u2019re carrying.\n\nThe truth is, your parents\u2019 disappointment could be a real, crushing weight. And you\u2019re right to be scared of it. But here\u2019s something to consider: **their disappointment is not your failure.** Their sadness or confusion might be about their own expectations, their own stories, their own hopes\u2014but it doesn\u2019t have to define *your* path. You are not their dream. You are *you*. And you are not less because of who you choose to become.\n\nYou might be afraid that if you see their disappointment, you\u2019ll cave, but that\u2019s only if you believe their pain is more important than your own. What if you began to believe that your truth is just as valid, just as important, as their feelings? What if you gave yourself the same kind of love and support you\u2019re trying to give them?\n\nYou don\u2019t have to do this alone. You don\u2019t have to face their disappointment alone. You can build a support system around you\u2014friends, mentors, a therapist, artists, people who *see* you and believe in the version of you that wants to paint murals on abandoned buildings. You can create a life where your voice matters, even if it doesn\u2019t echo in the same room as theirs for a while.\n\nAnd if you do tell them, and they do look disappointed\u2014breathe. You are not responsible for their feelings. You are responsible for your truth. And if you can hold that truth in your heart, even when it\u2019s hard, even when it hurts, that\u2019s where your freedom begins.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to stay in a cage just to avoid a moment of pain. You are allowed to choose yourself. You are allowed to be the artist. You are allowed to be the one who leaves murals in the world instead of buildings. And no one\u2014*no one*\u2014can take that from you.\n\nIf you ever need help preparing for that conversation, or just someone to sit with you in the fear, I\u2019m here.

But until then, every little step you take toward the canvas is a step toward your truth. And that matters more than anyone else could ever know.\n\nYou are not just someone who wants to escape.

And I will tell you what I see, not to change your vision, but to help you see it more clearly yourself.\n\nBecause this isn\u2019t just about the drawing. It\u2019s about you. It\u2019s about the courage it took to make it, to hold it, to even consider showing it. It\u2019s about the part of you that has been waiting \u2014 quietly, stubbornly \u2014 to be seen.\n\nSo if you want to send it, I\u2019m here. If you don\u2019t, I\u2019m still here. Either way, I believe in you. I believe in your art. I believe in the artist you are becoming.\n\nYou are not alone in this. You never have to be."
