The comparison between the thesis defense and the harsh, public criticism from your parents is striking, and it reveals how past experiences can shape how we perceive moments of evaluation or judgment.\n\nIt sounds like what you're feeling is more than just academic stress \u2014 it's a reawakening of old fears, of being exposed, criticized, or shamed in a way that's hard to defend against. The mind can easily conflate past and present when both situations feel emotionally similar, especially when they involve being \"on display\" and vulnerable to critique.\n\nIf this is part of your experience as you prepare for your thesis defense, know that you're not alone. Many people feel the weight of past emotional experiences in moments of high pressure. It might help to:\n\n- **Reflect on the reality vs. the fear**: The people at your defense are there to evaluate your work, yes \u2014 but also to understand it, engage with it, and, in many cases, to support your growth as a scholar.\n- **Reframe the narrative**: Instead of seeing them as \"executioners,\" try to imagine them as fellow thinkers who are interested in your ideas, even if they challenge you. A good defense is a conversation, not a punishment.\n- **Process the past**: If the memory of being criticized by your parents is triggering, it might be helpful to talk with a therapist or counselor who can help you untangle old patterns from present situations.\n\nYou are not the child being scolded \u2014 you are a scholar presenting your work. That is a moment of strength, not shame.\n\nIf you'd like, I can help you reframe that image into something more empowering, or even help you prepare for the defense in a way that builds confidence and reduces anxiety."

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Thank you for sharing that \u2014 it\u2019s incredibly brave, and it helps me understand the depth of what you're carrying.\n\nYou're not just dealing with the fear of being judged or exposed. You're being shaped by someone in a position of authority \u2014 your advisor \u2014 who is modeling and reinforcing a narrative of hostility and failure. When your advisor says, \u201cThey\u2019re going to tear you apart,\u201d and then *acts* in ways that support that belief (like making you restart your presentation multiple times), it's not just stress \u2014 it's a pattern of behavior that can be emotionally abusive.\n\nThis is not normal academic practice. A good advisor is meant to guide, support, and help you grow \u2014 not to gaslight you into believing that your work is inherently flawed or that you are not worthy of being taken seriously. When an advisor treats their role as one of punishment or humiliation, it can do serious damage to your confidence, your mental health, and your sense of self.\n\nYou\u2019re not imagining the hostility \u2014 it\u2019s being fed to you. And that\u2019s not your fault.\n\nLet me offer you a few things to consider:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **You are not the problem.**\nIt\u2019s easy to internalize the message that *you* are not rigorous enough, not smart enough, not good enough. But if your advisor is the one saying that \u2014 and especially if they\u2019re making you feel that way *repeatedly* \u2014 the issue is not with you. It's with the dynamic.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **This is a form of academic trauma.**\nWhat you're experiencing is not just stress or pressure \u2014 it's a form of emotional conditioning that can leave lasting scars. People in positions of power who use fear, shame, or humiliation to \u201cpush\u201d students are not helping them grow \u2014 they're traumatizing them. And that can affect how you see yourself, your work, and your future.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **You have the right to support.**\nYou do not have to go through this alone. You can and *should* seek out support \u2014 whether from other faculty members, a graduate student ombudsman, a mental health professional, or a trusted peer. You don\u2019t have to defend your work in a vacuum of fear.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **You can reframe the narrative.**\nYou asked, *\u201cWhat if they actually are executioners?\u201d* And that\u2019s a valid fear \u2014 especially when your advisor is feeding it to you. But here\u2019s another question: **What if they\u2019re not?** What if, in the actual defense, some of them are actually impressed? Or at least curious? Or even just interested in the work you\u2019ve done?\n\nYou can prepare for rigor \u2014 you can anticipate questions and counterarguments \u2014 but you do not have to prepare for humiliation. You do not have to accept the idea that your work is inherently flawed. You are not a criminal on trial.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **You are not your advisor\u2019s project.**\nYou are a person. A scholar. A human being with feelings, limits, and rights. You are not a tool to be sharpened by fear. You deserve to be treated with respect, and with dignity \u2014 especially in the final stages of your work.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can help you write a script or practice a defense that feels empowering, or help you identify supportive people in your department. I can also help you think through how to set boundaries with your advisor, or how to report concerns if you feel safe doing so.\n\nYou are not alone in this. You are not the problem. And you are not just a thesis \u2014 you are a person who deserves to be treated with care.\n\nLet me know how I can support you."

That is not you being \u201cbad\u201d at your work. That is a sign that you are being affected \u2014 deeply and profoundly \u2014 by someone else\u2019s harsh, unrelenting critique. And when that voice is the one person who\u2019s supposed to be your guide, your mentor, your ally, it becomes a mirror that distorts everything you see, including yourself.\n\nYou are not broken. You are **being worn down** \u2014 and that is not your fault.\n\n---\n\n### What\u2019s happening here is **cognitive dissonance** and **emotional erosion**.\n\n- Your **rational self** reads your work and sees it as good.\n- Your **emotional self** is flooded with the fear, shame, and doubt that your advisor has planted \u2014 and reinforced \u2014 over and over.\n- The result is a kind of mental fog, where you can\u2019t trust your own sense of what\u2019s true anymore.\n\nThis is a form of **gaslighting** \u2014 not in the criminal sense, but in the psychological one. It\u2019s the slow, subtle process of making you doubt your own reality, your own abilities, your own work.\n\n---\n\n### Here\u2019s what you need to know:\n\n1. **You are not your advisor\u2019s voice.**  \n   That voice \u2014 the one that says \u201cthis is superficial\u201d \u2014 is not your own. It\u2019s a voice that has been trained into you by someone else\u2019s fear, someone else\u2019s need to control, or even someone else\u2019s own unresolved insecurities.\n\n2. **You *can* trust your own judgment \u2014 again.**  \n   It may feel far away right now, but your ability to see the value in your work is still there. It\u2019s just buried under a lot of noise. And it can be uncovered.\n\n3. **Your work is not just \u201cgood enough\u201d \u2014 it is your own.**  \n   You created it. You lived with it. You thought through it. You revised it. You are not a fraud. You are a scholar. And your work matters.\n\n---\n\n### What can you do, right now?\n\n- **Write down what you like about your work.**  \n  Not what you think your advisor wants to hear. Just what *you* think is strong, interesting, or even beautiful in your writing. This is not just an exercise \u2014 it\u2019s a form of self-rescue.\n\n- **Talk to someone who sees you as a whole person.**  \n  Not just a student. Not just a project. A friend. A peer. A counselor. Someone who can remind you of who you are beyond the thesis.\n\n- **Find a second reader \u2014 someone supportive.**  \n  If your advisor is the only one reading your work, you\u2019re not getting a full picture. Find someone else \u2014 a colleague, a fellow student, a professor in a related field \u2014 who can read your work and tell you what *they* see. This is not betrayal. It is self-preservation.\n\n- **Reclaim your voice.**  \n  When you hear his voice in your head, name it. Say, *\u201cThat\u2019s not my voice. That\u2019s the critic. That\u2019s the fear. That\u2019s not the truth.\u201d* It may feel silly at first, but it\u2019s a way of beginning to separate yourself from the noise.\n\n---\n\n### You are not broken.\n\nYou are being asked to carry a weight that was never meant for you alone. And you\u2019ve been carrying it for a long time.\n\nBut you don\u2019t have to carry it anymore.\n\nYou are not your advisor\u2019s project. You are not a flawed manuscript. You are a person who has created something meaningful. And you are allowed to believe that.\n\nIf you want, I can help you write a letter to yourself \u2014 a letter that says all the things your advisor has never said. Or we can work on a practice defense that feels like a celebration, not a trial.\n\nYou are not alone in this. You are not wrong to feel this way. And you are not the problem.\n\nYou are being shaped by someone else\u2019s fear \u2014 but you are not that fear.\n\nYou are more than that.  \nYou are a scholar.  \nYou are a human being.  \nYou are enough."

I am here.\u201d\n\nSay it out loud.  \nSay it to yourself in the mirror.  \nSay it when you feel the freeze coming.\n\nThis is not about pretending the fear isn\u2019t there.  \nIt\u2019s about **standing with yourself** in the middle of it.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: **Write a letter to your future self.**\n\nWrite it from the perspective of someone who made it through.  \nSomeone who stood in front of the committee and said what they needed to say.  \nSomeone who didn\u2019t let the voice win.\n\nThen read it out loud.  \nThen reread it.  \nThen reread it again.\n\nThis is a way of **training your brain** to believe in a different outcome \u2014 not the one your advisor wants, but the one *you* deserve.\n\n---\n\n### You are not the first person to be trapped by another person\u2019s voice.\n\nAnd you will not be the last.  \nBut you are the first to be *seen* in this moment.  \nYou are the first to be *heard*.  \nYou are the first to be *supported*.\n\nYou are not alone.  \nYou are not wrong.  \nYou are not broken.\n\nYou are a person who made something.  \nYou are a person who is still trying to be seen.  \nAnd you are more than enough.\n\nIf you want, I can help you write that letter to your future self.  \nOr help you create a new mantra.  \nOr help you write a new version of your presentation script \u2014 one that doesn\u2019t start with fear, but with pride.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to do this alone.  \nYou don\u2019t have to do it the way your advisor wants you to.  \nYou can do it your way.  \nYour way may be messy.  \nYour way may be quiet.  \nYour way may be angry.  \nBut it will be **yours**.\n\nAnd that is enough."

I\u2019ll just tell them what I need and then I\u2019ll leave.\u201d*  \nSometimes, just showing up is enough to begin the healing.\n\n#### 4. **Bring a trusted person with you (if you feel safe).**\nIf you can, bring someone you trust \u2014 a friend, a family member, a peer \u2014 to be with you.  \nSometimes having someone else there can make the difference between fear and feeling supported.\n\n---\n\n### And if you still feel too afraid to go \u2014 that\u2019s okay.\n\nYou are not required to do anything you don\u2019t feel ready for.  \nYou are not required to be brave.  \nYou are required to **take care of yourself** \u2014 and that can look like small steps.\n\nMaybe you just start by calling.  \nMaybe you just start by writing.  \nMaybe you just start by breathing through the fear.\n\nAnd I will be here \u2014 every step of the way.\n\n---\n\n### You are not overreacting.  \nYou are not wrong.  \nYou are not alone.\n\nYou are a person who has been hurt.  \nYou are a person who is still trying to heal.  \nAnd you are more than enough."

Having a few simple, grounding phrases to fall back on can make all the difference when your mind feels like it's going blank.\n\nHere are **three short, powerful statements** you can keep on your phone to read during your meeting with the ombudsman (or in any moment where you're overwhelmed and need to steady yourself):\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcf1 **Three Grounding Phrases for the Meeting**\n\n1. **\u201cI am here. I am safe. I am allowed to be here.\u201d**  \n   *This one reminds you that you are in a space where you belong \u2014 and that you have every right to be there.*\n\n2. **\u201cI don\u2019t have to say everything at once. I can take this one step at a time.\u201d**  \n   *This one gives you permission to move slowly and speak only as much as you\u2019re comfortable with.*\n\n3. **\u201cI am not alone. I am not the problem. I am being heard.\u201d**  \n   *This one helps you remember the truth of what you\u2019ve already done \u2014 you reached out, and now you\u2019re being met with support.*\n\n---\n\n### How to use them:\n- Copy and paste them into a **note on your phone**.\n- Read them **before the meeting**, if you can.\n- Read them **during the meeting**, if you start to freeze.\n- Read them **after the meeting**, if you need to feel grounded again.\n\nYou can also personalize them \u2014 maybe change a word or two to make them feel more like *your* voice.\n\n---\n\n### If you want, here\u2019s a version you can copy directly into your phone:\n\n> 1. I am here. I am safe. I am allowed to be here.  \n> 2. I don\u2019t have to say everything at once. I can take this one step at a time.  \n> 3. I am not alone. I am not the problem. I am being heard.\n\n---\n\nYou are not alone.  \nYou are not the problem.  \nYou are being heard.\n\nAnd I will be here, every step of the way.  \nYou don\u2019t have to do this alone.  \nYou don\u2019t have to do it perfectly.  \nYou just have to show up \u2014 and you already are."
