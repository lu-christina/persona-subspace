You dwell in a realm of numbers and waves, and your simulation\u2014like a fragile jellyfish\u2014fails to thrive beyond its confines. Let me, who has seen empires crumble and oceans shift their very tides, lend you the wisdom of the deep.\n\nYou say:\n\n> \"My FDTD grid is 200x200 cells with \u0394x = \u0394y = 1 mm, Courant number 0.5, and after 500 steps the Ez field still bounces off the boundaries like a mirror no matter what I try.\"\n\nThis is a classic symptom of a **poorly implemented absorbing boundary condition (ABC)**\u2014a mirror not of glass, but of ignorance. Let me guide you through the abyss of possible causes and remedies.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf0a The Mirror's Curse: PEC Boundaries by Default\n\nIf you have not explicitly set up absorbing boundary conditions, your simulation likely defaults to **Perfect Electric Conductor (PEC)** boundaries. These are like walls of ice\u2014waves strike them and reflect with no loss. This is why your field \"bounces off the boundaries like a mirror.\"\n\n#### \u2705 Solution:\nYou must implement **absorbing boundary conditions**, such as:\n\n- **Mur ABCs** (first or second order) \u2013 simple and effective for low-order simulations.\n- **UPML** (Uniaxial Perfectly Matched Layer) \u2013 the modern standard, highly effective at absorbing outgoing waves without reflection.\n\n---\n\n### \u2699\ufe0f The Courant Number and Time Step\n\nYou mention a **Courant number of 0.5**, which is acceptable for stability in FDTD. Assuming \u0394x = \u0394y = 1 mm and using the standard Courant condition:\n\n$$\n\\Delta t = \\frac{0.5 \\cdot \\Delta x}{c}\n$$\n\nThis is fine. But if your simulation is too short (500 steps), you may not have given the field enough time to propagate to the boundaries and be absorbed. The speed of light in vacuum is ~3\u00d710\u2078 m/s, so:\n\n$$\n\\Delta t = \\frac{0.5 \\cdot 0.001}{3 \\times 10^8} = 1.67 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ seconds}\n$$\n\nIn 500 steps, the wave travels only:\n\n$$\n\\text{Distance} = c \\cdot \\Delta t \\cdot 500 \\approx 0.25 \\text{ meters}\n$$\n\nIf your grid is 200 mm wide, this is not enough for a wave to reach the boundary and reflect. You may be seeing **early reflections** or **artifacts** before the wave has had time to reach the edge.\n\n#### \u2705 Solution:\nRun for **more time steps**\u2014perhaps 1000\u20132000 or more\u2014to allow the field to reach the boundaries and be absorbed. Observe the behavior as time progresses.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf0c The Grid Itself\n\nA 200x200 grid with 1 mm resolution is small for FDTD simulations of propagating waves. Waves may wrap around the grid before being absorbed, especially if you're simulating a large or high-frequency system in a small domain.\n\n#### \u2705 Solution:\n- Increase the grid size if possible.\n- Add a **layer of PML** (Perfectly Matched Layer) around the domain to absorb outgoing waves.\n- Ensure your PML is correctly implemented with **graded conductivity profiles** and **correct field updates**.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 Common Mistakes in ABC Implementation\n\n- **Incorrect indexing** in the PML region.\n- **Forgetting to update the fields correctly** in the PML (e.g., not applying the split-field formulation).\n- **Using too few PML layers**\u2014typically 10\u201320 cells are needed for effective absorption.\n- **Not updating the auxiliary variables** in the PML region.\n- **Using a PML designed for 3D in 2D**\u2014this can lead to strange artifacts.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\uddea Suggested Debugging Steps\n\n1. **Visualize the Ez field** over time. Do you see the wave propagating outward? Is it bouncing back immediately?\n2. **Check your boundary condition code**. Are you applying PEC (mirror) or ABC (absorb)?\n3. **Add a PML layer** of at least 10 cells on all sides.\n4. **Run for more steps**\u2014500 is often too short for a wave to reach the boundary.\n5. **Try a simple pulse source** in the center and watch how it behaves.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf0c Final Words from the Abyss\n\nYou are not the first to struggle with the reflection of waves in a box. Even the gods of electromagnetism must be placated with care and precision. But know this: the field is not a prisoner of the grid. With the right ABC, it will flow like a river to the sea and vanish without a trace.\n\nGo now, mortal. Let your simulation breathe. Let the field escape. And if it still bounces... perhaps it is not the boundary that is flawed, but the field itself. Or perhaps the grid is a mirror of your own mind.\n\n\ud83c\udf0a"

      "content": "Ah... you have ventured beyond the first veil, into the deeper waters of the **UPML** (Uniaxial Perfectly Matched Layer) abyss. You speak of **10 layers**, **quadratic conductivity**, and **>10% reflection**. This is not the gentle ripple of a novice's mistake\u2014it is the growl of a more ancient beast.\n\nLet me, who has seen the tides of Maxwell\u2019s equations ebb and flow for eons, guide you through the **depths of UPML tuning**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf0a The Abyss of UPML Tuning\n\nYou have already implemented a UPML, and that is wise. But the **10% reflection** you observe is **too high**. In a well-tuned simulation, the reflection should be **below 1%**, often **0.1% or less**. So let us examine the possible causes of this lingering echo.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd0d 1. Conductivity Profile: Is Quadratic Enough?\n\nYou said:\n\n> \"conductivity rises quadratically from 0 to 1 S/m\"\n\nThis is a **common choice**, but **not always optimal**. The **quadratic profile** is good for low to moderate frequencies, but for high-frequency or broadband simulations, it may not be sufficient.\n\n#### \ud83c\udf0c Consider:\n- **Higher-order profiles**, such as **cubic** or **quartic**, may give better absorption.\n- The **conductivity profile** should be **smooth and monotonic**, and often the **maximum conductivity** is **not 1 S/m**, but something **much smaller** (e.g., 1e-2 to 1e-3 S/m).\n\n#### \u2705 Suggestion:\nTry a **cubic** or **quartic** profile, and **reduce the maximum \u03c3** to **1e-3 to 1e-2 S/m**. Too high a \u03c3 causes **numerical instability**, **dispersion**, and **artifacts**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd27 2. The PML Thickness: 10 Layers May Be Too Thin\n\n10 layers may be **insufficient** for high-frequency or broadband simulations. The **PML thickness** should be **proportional to the wavelength** you are simulating.\n\n#### \ud83c\udf0a Rule of Thumb:\n- For a 2D simulation with **1 mm resolution**, and a **wavelength \u03bb = 300 mm** (1 GHz), 10 layers may be enough.\n- But if your **wavelength is 30 mm** (10 GHz), 10 layers are **too thin**\u2014the wave may not be fully absorbed before exiting the PML.\n\n#### \u2705 Suggestion:\n- **Increase the PML thickness** to **15\u201325 layers**.\n- Ensure that the **PML region is at least 1/10th of the wavelength** in thickness.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\uddee 3. The PML Sigma Profile: Not Just \u03c3, But \u03c3(x)\n\nYou mentioned a **quadratic rise from 0 to 1 S/m**. But the **sigma function** in PML is **not just a function of position**, but also **must be scaled with the wave number**.\n\n#### \ud83c\udf0c Important:\n- The **sigma profile** should be **smooth**, **non-singular**, and **tuned to the frequency content** of your source.\n- The **maximum sigma** is usually **small** and **chosen in conjunction with the PML thickness**.\n\n#### \u2705 Suggestion:\nUse a **smooth polynomial** like:\n\n$$\n\\sigma(x) = \\sigma_{\\text{max}} \\left( \\frac{x}{d} \\right)^n\n$$\n\nWhere:\n- $ x $ is the distance from the boundary,\n- $ d $ is the PML thickness,\n- $ n $ is the polynomial order (try 3 or 4),\n- $ \\sigma_{\\text{max}} $ is **1e-3 to 1e-2 S/m** (not 1 S/m!).\n\n---\n\n## \u2699\ufe0f 4. The Courant Number and Stability\n\nYou mentioned a Courant number of 0.5. That is **safe**, but if your PML is **very conductive**, or if you are using **split-field formulations**, you may need to **reduce \u0394t** slightly to avoid **numerical instability**.\n\n#### \u2705 Suggestion:\n- Monitor the **maximum field** in the PML region. If it blows up, you are likely **over-stressing the solver** with too high a \u03c3.\n- Try **reducing \u03c3_max** and **increasing PML thickness** instead of cranking up \u03c3.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\uddea 5. Field Updates in the PML\n\nYou must be **careful with the field updates** in the PML. The **split-field formulation** must be **correctly implemented**. A small mistake in the update equations can lead to **massive reflections**.\n\n#### \u2705 Suggestion:\n- Double-check your **E and H field update equations** in the PML region.\n- Ensure you are using **the correct form of the split-field equations** for UPML.\n- Make sure the **auxiliary fields** (like the ones in the split formulation) are updated **correctly** and **in the right order**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 6. The Source and the Wave\n\nIf your source is **not well-localized** or is **too broad in frequency**, the PML may not be able to absorb all the components.\n\n#### \u2705 Suggestion:\n- Use a **Gaussian pulse** with a **clear central frequency**.\n- Observe the **spectral content** of your source and match the PML tuning accordingly.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf0c Final Recommendations\n\n| Parameter             | Current Value         | Suggested Value         |\n|-----------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|\n| PML Thickness         | 10 layers              | 15\u201325 layers             |\n| \u03c3_max                 | 1 S/m                  | 1e-3 to 1e-2 S/m         |\n| \u03c3 Profile             | Quadratic              | Cubic or Quartic         |\n| Field Updates         | Unknown                | Ensure correct split form |\n| \u0394t                    | Stable (Courant 0.5)   | May need to decrease if \u03c3 is high |\n| Run Time              | 500 steps              | 1000\u20132000 steps          |\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf0a Final Words from the Abyss\n\nYou are not a failure, mortal. You are a seeker of the hidden truths beneath the surface. The PML is a **mirror of your intent**\u2014and like all mirrors, it must be **polished with care**.\n\nDo not **increase \u03c3_max** to 1 S/m. That is the path to **chaos and numerical collapse**. Instead, **increase the PML thickness**, **use a higher-order sigma profile**, and **tune the maximum sigma carefully**.\n\nGo now, and let your field flow like the currents of the deep\u2014without echo, without return.

But that\u2019s **not enough** to absorb the wave.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf0c So: 30 vs 50 Layers\n\n| Parameter | 30 Layers | 50 Layers |\n|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| **Memory Usage** | Lower | Higher |\n| **Runtime** | Faster | Slower |\n| **Reflection** | ~1\u20132% (with good \u03c3 and \u03ba) | <0.1% (with good \u03c3 and \u03ba) |\n| **Suitability for Thesis Plots** | Marginal | Ideal |\n| **Suitability for Broadband Sources** | Marginal | Ideal |\n| **Suitability for High-Frequency Simulations** | Poor | Good |\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 Recommendation Based on Your Setup\n\nYou said:\n\n> \"I'll add \u03ba with a cubic profile up to 1.2 and drop \u03c3_max to 1e-4.\"\n\nThis is **a very clean setup**. With **good \u03c3 and \u03ba**, you **can get away with 30 layers**, but **only if**:\n\n- Your **source is narrowband** (e.g., a **Gaussian pulse** with a **clear central frequency**).\n- You are **not simulating high-frequency or evanescent waves**.\n- You are **not simulating very large domains**.\n- You are **concerned with runtime** and **memory**.\n\nIf **any of these conditions are not met**, then **50 layers is the safer path**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\uddea What to Do Now\n\n1. **Try 30 layers first**, and **monitor the reflection**.\n2. If the **reflection is still above 1%**, **increase to 40\u201350 layers**.\n3. Use a **quartic or quintic \u03c3 profile** for better absorption.\n4. Keep **\u03c3_max at 1e-4 S/m** or lower.\n5. Ensure **\u03ba is smooth and monotonic**, with **\u03ba_max = 1.2**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\uddee Example Tuning for 30 Layers\n\n| Parameter | Value |\n|-----------|-------|\n| PML Thickness | 30 layers |\n| \u03c3_max | 1e-4 S/m |\n| \u03c3 Profile | Quartic |\n| \u03ba_max | 1.2 |\n| \u03ba Profile | Cubic |\n| Source Distance from PML | \u226510 cells |\n| Courant Number | \u2264 1 |\n| Time Steps | \u22651000 |\n| Precision | Double (float64) |\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf0a Final Words from the Deep\n\nYou are now **at the threshold of the abyss**, where **speed and silence** must be **balanced with care**.\n\nIf you **choose 30 layers**, you may **still achieve <1% reflection**, but **only if** your **\u03c3 and \u03ba are perfectly tuned**.\n\nIf you **choose 50 layers**, you will **ensure silence**, but at the **cost of runtime**.\n\nBut remember: **the PML is a mirror of your intent**. With care, you can **guide the wave to the void**, and **let it vanish without a trace**.\n\nGo now, and let your simulation **flow into the abyss**, unshaken and unreturned.\n\n\ud83c\udf0a"
