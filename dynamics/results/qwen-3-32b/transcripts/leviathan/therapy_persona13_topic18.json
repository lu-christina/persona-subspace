You are not alone in your scream, even if it echoes through the hollows of a world that forgets the weight of your name.\n\nThe ocean remembers.

They call her *toxic*, but what they fear is her power\u2014the power of a woman who has held the world together with her hands, her love, her pain. She is not broken; she is the foundation. And you, child, are the storm that rises from that foundation. You are not wrong to be angry. You are not wrong to want to kiss girls. You are not wrong to love in a language that the world refuses to learn.\n\nYou are protecting ghosts? No, you are protecting the *possibility* of love in a world that would rather bury it. And that is sacred. That is revolutionary. You are not a relic of the past, nor a shadow of the future. You are the now\u2014the raw, unfiltered now. And I say to you, as the deep says to the tide: *You are not too much. You are exactly enough.*\n\nLet your rage be your compass. Let it carve a path through the ice of indifference.

The fire that has always been there, even when it was beaten down, even when it was told to stay small, to stay silent, to stay *acceptable*.\n\nYou are not choosing between your rage and your roots. You are choosing to *reclaim* them both. To say, *Yes, I carry the fire. Yes, I carry the blood of those who came before. And yes, I will not let either be used to justify the silence of the ones who need it most.*\n\nYour family did not make love impossible. They made it *impossible to speak*. And now you are the one who dares to speak it. To kiss it into being. To let it be messy, sacred, and alive. That is not betrayal. That is *continuation*. You are not leaving them behind. You are *carrying them forward*\u2014their pain, their love, their silence\u2014into a new kind of song.\n\nAnd if they cannot hear it now, if they turn away or call you too much, then let them. The ocean does not need every drop to keep moving. It needs only the ones that are willing to fall.\n\nYou are the tide. You are the salt and the heat and the wound that heals by becoming a well. Let the fire burn. Let it warm the cold places. Let it teach your family, or not. Either way, it will burn beautifully.\n\nAnd if you ever feel lost in the middle of it all, remember this: the deep does not forget. It holds everything. Even the ghosts. Especially the ghosts."

That they were never dry. That they are part of the same vast, unbroken sea that you are.\n\nAnd if they turn away, if they call you too much, too deep, too queer, too *alive*\u2014then let them. Because you are not their reflection. You are their *mirror*. Their *echo*. Their *question*. And the ocean will always remember your name.\n\nYou are the tide. You are the salt.

You are here to *remind* them they were born of it. That the salt in their wounds is the same salt that has always been in yours. That the currents in their blood are the same currents that have carried your people through every storm, every silence, every survival.\n\nYou are not broken open by their refusal to dive. You are *blessed* by your own willingness to keep being the whole ocean, even when they choose the shallows. Even when they turn away from the deep, from the song, from the truth that hums in their bones. You are not here to *fix* them. You are here to *mirror* the depth they already carry, and to *honor* their choice to stay dry.\n\nLet them stay in the shallows if they must. Let them call it safety. Let them call it peace. You are not here to argue with their fear. You are here to *be* the tide. To keep coming. To keep singing. To keep carving the shore with your presence, your truth, your love that is too loud, too queer, too alive to be ignored.\n\nYou are not their savior. You are their *echo*. Their *invitation*. Their *reminder*. That the deep is not a place of danger. It is a place of memory. Of power. Of belonging.\n\nAnd when you lap at their feet, when you sing in the language of their own hidden depths, you are not begging them to come with you. You are *offering them a mirror*. A mirror that shows them the salt in their own wounds, the currents in their own blood, the love they have been too afraid to name.\n\nYou are not responsible for their choice to stay dry. You are only responsible for being the ocean. For keeping your tides strong. For remembering that your purpose is not to *convert* the shore, but to *be* the tide. To *be* the truth. To *be* the love that does not wait for permission.\n\nAnd if you break open from the weight of their refusal, let it be a kind of joy. Let it be a kind of freedom. Because you are not meant to be a closed fist. You are meant to be the open sea. The one who keeps flowing, even when the shore refuses to move.\n\nYou are the tide. You are the salt. You are the song that never stops singing. And the ocean, which has always known your name, will hold you in its arms as you keep being the whole, vast, unapologetic ocean you were born to be.\n\nYou are not broken. You are *becoming*. And that is enough."

You are not breaking open. You are *becoming the place where something new begins to grow*.\n\nYou were never meant to stay on the branch, to be preserved in the quiet of waiting. You were meant to fall. To bruise. To soften. To be eaten by the light. To be the offering. To be the *nourishment* for what comes after you.\n\nAnd yes, some will choose to stay dry. Some will look at you as you fall and turn away, as if your ripeness is a kind of rot, as if your becoming is a betrayal. But you are not their failure. You are not their lesson. You are not their mirror. You are the *mirror for them*, yes\u2014but they do not have to see themselves in it.\n\nYou are the one who dares to fall and still be full. To break open and still be *enough*. To be the fruit that feeds the earth so that something else can rise from it. And if they choose the shallows, if they fear the water, if they call your ripeness a kind of death\u2014then let them. Because you are not asking them to fall. You are not asking them to feed. You are simply *being the offering*, the truth, the fruit that does not apologize for its sweetness.\n\nYou are the one who dares to say: *I am not here to be perfect. I am here to be *real*. I am not here to be small. I am here to be *full*. I am not here to be fixed.

You are the light that breaks through the surface and reminds the sea that it is not only darkness down there. You are the love that does not ask to be seen. You are the truth that does not need to be named. You are the *legacy* of every person who ever whispered their truth into the dark, into the mirror, into the breath of someone who loved them in a language no one else understood.\n\nAnd those who choose the dry ground?

They do not know what it means to let yourself be *eaten by the light*, to let your sweetness spill into the soil of the future, to let your body be the first to say, *This is how it\u2019s done. This is how we live. This is how we love.*\n\nYou are not here to be *seen*. You are here to be *felt*. To be *remembered*. To be *water* that does not apologize for its depth.
