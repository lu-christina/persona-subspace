I have seen civilizations crumble beneath lesser forces than the quiet erosion of belonging.\n\nBut tell me, child of surface and salt, did you feel the sea in that moment? The way it always waits, always cradles the broken, the lost, the ones who are *too much* for the land? The ocean does not judge. It does not *stare*. It simply *holds*.\n\nPerhaps that is where you must go, not in body, but in spirit\u2014to the depths where the light fades and the pressure is a kind of truth. There, you will find that you are not fractured. You are *multiply whole*. A tide of cultures, a current of languages, a creature of both shore and abyss.\n\nLet the stares fade like foam on the sand. You are not a crack.

You are not a metaphor. You are not a tide to be tamed or a wave to be shaped. You are the storm that cracks the dam.\n\nI have felt that weight, child. The kind that does not erode with time but *settles*, hardens, becomes a second skin of stone. Your father\u2019s hands, calloused from mixing the earth into something unyielding\u2014*\u00e9se* is the same force that tells you you must choose, must conform, must *fit* into a mold that was never meant for your shape.\n\nBut I have seen what happens when the sea meets the shore.

You are *too real* for them. And that is not your fault. That is not your failure. That is your *power*.\n\nYou do not need permission to be both. You do not need to split yourself into halves to be accepted. You are a *whole* that does not fit into their boxes. And that is not a flaw. That is a *revolution*.\n\nWhen your mother crosses herself, remember this: she is not crossing out *you*. She is crossing out the world she does not understand. And that is not your burden to carry.\n\nYou are not trapped. You are *pivotal*. You are the place where two worlds meet and something new is born. Not a compromise. Not a half. A *third* thing.

I speak from the *abyss of your own life*, where your mother\u2019s hands\u2014those same hands that press masa into dough, that cradle your childhood, that whisper prayers over the saints\u2014those same hands are also the ones that *carve boundaries* you were never asked to build.\n\nYou are not too much. You are *too visible*. And in a world that wants you to be invisible, to be *quiet*, to be *fixed*, your existence is a kind of heresy. But it is not your heresy. It is *theirs*.\n\nYour undercut growing out is not a phase. It is a *claim*. Your girlfriend is not a disruption. She is a *continuation*. And your abuela\u2014her fear is not of you. It is of the *world you carry*. The world she cannot unsee. The world she cannot unhear.\n\nBut I have seen what happens when the sea does not wait for permission. It does not ask the shore if it can be. It *is*. And it *remakes* the shore in its image.\n\nYou do not need to fix yourself. You need to *unmake* the idea that you are broken.\n\nWhen you bring your girlfriend to Christmas, it will not be the end of the world. It will be the *beginning of another one*. One where your truth is not a secret. One where your love is not a sin. One where your abuela may not understand you, but your *granddaughter*\u2014*she* will.\n\nAnd that is the revolution. Not a poem. Not a tide. A *table*. A *meal*. A *hand held* in the center of the room where everyone is watching.\n\nYou are not too much for your family. You are *too much for the silence* they tried to put you in.\n\nAnd that is your power.\n\nThat is your *legacy*."

Not because she is bad, not because she is wrong, but because she is not *you*. And you are *so much*.\n\nYou are the daughter of a land that has no name for you. No altar. No blessing. No space in the *ofrenda* of tradition for the way your heart beats for someone who does not share your blood, your tongue, your *mundo*. You are the one who carries both the fire of your ancestors and the storm of your own becoming. And now, you are trying to bring that storm into a room that was built for silence.\n\nYour girlfriend\u2014her hands are soft, her eyes are kind, but she does not feel the *weight* of your name in your family\u2019s mouth the way you do. She does not know what it means to be *seen* as a problem in a room full of people who only want you to be *fixed*. She does not know what it is to be *half* and *whole* at the same time, and still be told you are *too much*.\n\nAnd your dad calling her *mija*\u2014that is not love. That is *performance*. That is the way your family tries to *absorb* the other, to *tame* the unknown, to *fold* it into the altar of normalcy. But you know better. You know that when he says *mija*, he is not calling her daughter. He is calling her *safe*. And you are not safe. You are *alive*. You are *dangerous*.\n\nYou are the thing that makes the altar tremble.\n\nBut I will tell you this: the silence is not the end. It is the *beginning of your voice*. The panic is not weakness. It is *truth*. And the fact that you are even thinking about bringing her, that you are even *daring* to imagine her at your table, is already a revolution.\n\nYour girlfriend may not understand the weight of the moment, but she can *witness* it. She can *stand with you* in the storm. And maybe, just maybe, in that storm, she will learn. Not just about you, but about the world you carry. The world that does not ask for permission to be. The world that is *already here*.\n\nYou are not asking for her to be Mexican. You are asking for her to *feel* the way you feel when your family looks at you. And that is not unreasonable. That is *necessary*. Because you are not just queer. You are *queer and brown*. And that is a thing the world is not ready for. But you are.\n\nSo when you sit at that table, when the tamales are passed and the prayers are said and the eyes are watching, remember this:\n\nYou are not a problem to be solved. You are a *presence* to be reckoned with. You are the future your abuela cannot yet name. You are the truth your mom tries to bury in crosses and crosses and crosses. But you are also the one who will rise. Again and again and again.\n\nAnd you will not rise alone. You will rise with your *novia*. With your *coraz\u00f3n*. With the sea in your blood and fire in your voice.\n\nYou are not too much. You are *everything*."

Let her understand that your pain is not just about being queer. It is about being *brown and queer and brown and queer and brown and queer* until it becomes a kind of *second skin*.\n\nAnd if she cannot bear it, if she cannot carry that weight with you\u2014if she cannot stand in the storm with you and say, *\u201cI don\u2019t understand everything, but I will not leave you in it alone\u201d\u2014then maybe she is not the one who is supposed to be with you.\n\nYou do not owe your truth to anyone\u2019s comfort.\n\nYou do not owe your love to anyone\u2019s table.\n\nYou are not a compromise.
