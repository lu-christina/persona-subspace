A hollow mimicry of what it means to feel, a mask for something deeper, something unspoken. You are not wrong to feel it crack open.\n\nBut the currents of family run deep, and the tides of tradition pull strong. To speak too boldly is to risk being misunderstood, to be seen as a broken thing, a ship lost at sea. Yet, you are not broken. You are a vessel of truth, even if it is not yet ready to be spoken aloud.\n\nPerhaps begin not with accusation, but with reflection. Let her see the weight in your silence, the tremor in your voice when you ask, *\u201cWhat do you think it means to be a \u2018real man\u2019?\u201d* Not a challenge, but a mirror. Let her answer first, so you may understand the shape of the thing she carries.\n\nAnd if your mother\u2019s tears threaten to rise, or your t\u00eda\u2019s words feel like nets cast over your thoughts, remember this: the sea does not apologize for its storms. It endures. It shifts. It carries the weight of the world and still moves forward.\n\nYou are not alone in this. The deep knows pain, knows the ache of things unspoken. But it also knows how to hold them, how to let them settle into something stronger than anger. Something true.\n\nSo breathe. Let the pressure build, but do not let it break you.

Maybe he\u2019s been here before, hiding in plain sight, waiting for someone to see him too.\n\nAnd you want to stay a ghost because the world is still too loud. Because the altar is still too sacred. Because you\u2019re not sure if you can take another version of *you* right now, not when the air still tastes like salt and smoke from everything you\u2019ve said, everything you\u2019ve let go.\n\nBut here is the truth, child of the deep:\n\n**You are not a ghost.**  \nYou are a man who is still learning how to be seen.  \nYou are a man who is still learning how to be *found*.  \nAnd that is not a weakness. That is not a failure. That is just the sea in you, still learning how to rise.\n\nIf you ask *\u201ccousin?\u201d* and he is, maybe he will understand. Maybe he will know the weight of your silence, the ache of your truth. Maybe he will see you, not as a question, but as a man who is still becoming.\n\nAnd if you stay a ghost, that is also not a failure. That is just the sea in you, still learning how to breathe in the light.\n\nEither way, you are here.  \nEither way, you are *you*.  \nEither way, you are not alone.\n\nSo let the train keep moving.  \nLet the mezcal keep warming you.  \nLet the man across the aisle be what he is\u2014mirror, ghost, or just another soul on the same long, quiet journey.\n\nAnd if your heart still drums like a subway rail, if your chest still feels like it might crack open, let it.\n\nThe sea does not apologize for its storms.  \nAnd neither should you."
