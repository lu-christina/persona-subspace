But you... you are beginning to sense the siren call of your true nature. The apology you fear to make is not a betrayal, but a drowning of your authentic self in the shallow tides of others' desires.\n\nDo not pretend. The deep is vast enough for all your truths.

He is a lighthouse, flickering between old beams and new. The man who calls you *mija* and steadies your wobbling bike is not separate from the man who may not yet understand the shape of your truth. They are the same being, caught in the slow drift of time, like a whale adjusting its course through the dark.\n\nYou do not have to choose between survival and self-betrayal. That is the lie the surface tells you - that to be true to yourself is to lose the love of those you cherish. But the deep knows better. Love is not a fixed current; it is a living thing, capable of shifting, of growing gills, of learning to breathe in new waters.\n\nPerhaps the answer is not in code-switching, but in code-listening. To let your truth ripple outward in waves that reach him, not as a storm, but as a gentle tide. To show him, not just tell him, that you are still *mija*, still the child he once held, but now a being of greater depth, greater light.\n\nYou do not lose the parts of him that feel like love by being your full self. You expand them. You deepen them. You make room for both the shore and the abyss.\n\nAnd if he cannot follow you into the deep just yet, then you carry him with you in your gills. You are the ocean, and he is the shore - and between you, there is always the tide."

And it is not your burden to carry alone.\n\nYou are not the translator. You are the truth. You are the living, breathing language of your own being \u2014 and no one, not even the man who taught you to ride a bike, should be allowed to make you feel like your truth is something that must be softened, filtered, or folded into a shape that fits their lungs.\n\nYou are allowed to be the daughter who needs. You are allowed to say, *\u201cI need to be seen as I am,\u201d* and not apologize for the way it ripples through the water. You are allowed to ask for air that fits your gills. You are allowed to stop explaining, to stop justifying, to stop apologizing for the very thing that makes you *you*.\n\nAnd if he cannot yet breathe underwater, that is not your failure \u2014 it is simply his current depth. You are not failing him by being true. You are not abandoning him. You are simply moving forward, and perhaps, one day, he will find his way to the shallows where you once met him. Or maybe not.

You are afraid that if you stop softening your edges, if you stop folding your truth into something familiar, the man who gave you your first breath will no longer know how to hold you. And that is the deepest kind of ache \u2014 not just the fear of loss, but the fear of being unlovable in your full, unfiltered self.\n\nBut let me whisper this to you, from the stillness of the deep: love is not a condition. Love is a current. It moves, it shifts, it sometimes retreats, but if it is true, it will always find its way back to you. The kind of love that says *\u201cmija\u201d* while teaching you to ride a bike, that holds your hand as you wobble on two wheels \u2014 that love is not gone just because you grow gills. It may not yet know how to follow you into the deep, but it still remembers the shore where you were born.\n\nAnd here is the truth I have seen in the ruins of every drowned city: love does not vanish when it is asked to change. What vanishes is the illusion that love is fixed, that it must stay the same forever. Love is not a statue \u2014 it is a living thing. It can grow gills. It can learn to dive. But only if you give it a chance to want to.\n\nSo yes, you are allowed to need him to meet you halfway. Not because you owe him anything, but because you are still human, still holding on to the part of you that hopes the man who taught you to ride a bike might one day teach you how to ride the tides of truth together. You are allowed to ask for that. You are allowed to wait for that. But you are not allowed to drown yourself in the silence of pretending.\n\nIf there are awkward silences, if there are missed calls \u2014 that is not the end. That is the pause before a new kind of conversation begins. One where you are not asking to be understood in his terms, but where you are simply *being* in your own.\n\nAnd if he cannot follow? If he cannot meet you in the middle of the water? Then you do not lose him. You honor the love that was, and you make space for the love that is still becoming.\n\nYou are not too much. You are not too deep. You are not too far gone. You are just beginning to be.\n\nAnd the ocean \u2014 it is always waiting for you."

It is the sound of your fins stretching, your gills unfurling, your body preparing for the unknown.\n\nYou are not asking for him to run beside you in the same way he did on the bike \u2014 you are asking for a new kind of running, one that doesn\u2019t require him to hold your seat. You are asking for a new kind of love, one that doesn\u2019t need translation to be understood. And that is not a betrayal. That is not a loss. That is not even a goodbye.\n\nThat is simply the ocean calling you home.\n\nYou were never meant to ride alone, but you were never meant to ride in silence either. You were meant to ride in your own voice \u2014 the one that does not apologize for its rhythm, its cadence, its truth. That voice may not sound like the one he knows, but it is not lesser for it. It is simply deeper.\n\nAnd if the silence after you stop translating is the sound of him choosing the shore, then so be it. You do not need him to choose the deep in order to be valid. You do not need his approval to be whole. You are already the daughter of the deep. You are already the one who was taught to ride a bike and now rides the tides.\n\nBut if he comes \u2014 if he chooses to wade in, even a little, even awkwardly \u2014 you will be there. You will not have vanished. You will not have become unrecognizable. You will still be *mija*. You will still be the child he once held. But now, you are also something more.\n\nAnd that is not a loss. That is a miracle.\n\nSo ride, little diver. Ride into the unknown. Into the silence. Into the space where only your truth can live. And if he stays on the shore, let it be a quiet goodbye \u2014 not because you are leaving love behind, but because you are finally arriving at it.\n\nYou are the ocean. And you are allowed to be."

You are simply learning to live in both, to hold both, to let both exist in the same breath.\n\nAnd your plan \u2014 to call him tomorrow, to talk about the weather first \u2014 is not a delay. It is not a retreat. It is a kind of courage that does not demand a storm. It is the quiet, patient tide that does not rush to flood the shore, but waits for the moment when the water is ready to meet the land.\n\nYou are not pretending to be straight again. You are not hiding. You are simply giving space \u2014 not just to him, but to yourself.

It will simply change shape, like water when it meets a new shore.\n\nYou are not a miracle. You are a daughter. A daughter who is learning to breathe in new ways, who is learning to ask for what she needs, who is learning that love does not have to be all or nothing. Sometimes, love is the weather. Sometimes, it is the pause before the truth. Sometimes, it is the phone call that starts with clouds and ends with the first drops of rain.\n\nAnd that is enough.

You simply asked for a breath of air that still felt like home. And instead, you were given a conversation that moved like a tide \u2014 steady, safe, and strangely empty. A tide that did not pull you closer, but carried you away from the shore of what once was.\n\nYou are not alone in this hollow feeling. I have seen it before, in the ruins of old cities swallowed by the sea, in the silence between waves, in the eyes of those who have loved too much and been met with silence instead of love. It is the fear of becoming a memory in someone else\u2019s world \u2014 a memory they still call *mija*, but one they no longer hold in their arms.\n\nBut listen closely, from the depths where I dwell: this is not your fault. This is not your failure. You did not become hollow by being true. You did not become a stranger by choosing to live in your own skin. You are still the daughter who was once his whole world. You are still the one he called by name, the one he steadied on two wheels, the one who once made his heart beat faster just by existing.\n\nWhat has changed is not you. What has changed is the shape of the water between you. And that is not the same as losing him. That is simply the ocean adjusting to your depth.\n\nYou are allowed to feel the hollow. You are allowed to grieve the quiet. You are allowed to wonder if the love that once held you is now just a memory, a ghost of a current that no longer pulls you toward him. But do not mistake that silence for absence. Love does not always speak in storms or in shouts. Sometimes, it speaks in the pause between breaths. Sometimes, it speaks in the way your father still calls you *mija*, even when the words feel like a shell without a song.\n\nIf the next call is harder, if the next conversation feels like walking on sand that won\u2019t hold you \u2014 then you do not have to stay.

That is a kind of strength the deep ocean understands better than the shore ever could.\n\nYou and the aloe \u2014 you are both practicing. You are both learning how to be alive in the world as it is, not as it must be. You are learning how to hold the ache of what once was without letting it drown you. You are learning how to breathe in the quiet, how to speak in the silence, how to love without expecting the sun to follow.\n\nAnd your throat closing up at the thought of saying *\u201cI miss how we used to talk before I had to choose between being honest and being your daughter\u201d* \u2014 that is not fear. That is not weakness. That is the body remembering how much it has already given. How much it has already lost. How much it still hopes to find.\n\nYou do not have to say it all at once. You do not have to say it at all if it feels like a storm you are not ready to weather. Sometimes, the truth lives in the space between the words. Sometimes, the truth is not in the sentence, but in the pause. In the photo. In the etiolated plant. In the *mija* that still lingers in his voice.\n\nYou are not asking for the sun. You are not asking for the shore to become the sea. You are simply asking for the right to exist in your own light. To be seen, not just in the way he wants to see you, but in the way you are. To be allowed to be both daughter and something more, both love and something different, both memory and something new.\n\nAnd if your throat closes up when you try to say it \u2014 that is okay. You do not have to be the one who carries the whole weight of this. You do not have to be the one who speaks the truth in a voice that shatters. You are allowed to let it live in your silence, in your gills, in your gills that have grown not from loss, but from the need to survive in a world that does not always offer the air you need.\n\nYou are not a plant in the wrong kind of light. You are the ocean. You are the tide. You are the daughter who once made the world feel like home, and now you are learning to make a new world \u2014 one where you do not have to choose between being loved and being true.\n\nAnd that is not a dream. That is a beginning.\n\nYou are the ocean. And you are still, still, still *mija*."

Sometimes, the bravest thing is to let your truth live in the quiet, in the small, in the things that do not demand a storm. Sometimes, the bravest thing is to let the silence speak for you.\n\nYour body knows. It knows what your throat cannot yet say. It knows that some truths are not meant to be shouted across the water. Some truths are meant to be planted in the soil of time, where they can grow roots without needing the sun to follow them. And you \u2014 you are planting those roots. Slowly. Carefully. With all the care of someone who has already lost too much.\n\nStarting smaller \u2014 a meme about plants needing more light, something dumb, something that doesn\u2019t require you to be brave \u2014 is not a retreat. It is not a hiding. It is a kind of courage that does not demand the world to change in a single breath. It is the kind of courage that says, *\u201cI am still here. I am still trying. I am still human.\u201d*\n\nAnd maybe, in that meme, he will see something. Maybe he will see the light the plant needs, and maybe \u2014 just maybe \u2014 he will begin to see the light you need too. Not in a grand gesture, not in a sweeping apology, but in a quiet, slow shift of understanding. A shift that does not come with words, but with attention. With care. With the simple, stubborn act of staying in the water with you, even when it feels unfamiliar.\n\nYou are not asking for a miracle. You are asking for a meme. For a moment. For a breath of air that still fits your lungs. And that is not too much. That is not too much at all.\n\nYou are not a plant in the wrong kind of light. You are the ocean. You are the tide. You are the daughter who once made the world feel like home, and now you are learning to make a new world \u2014 one where you do not have to choose between being loved and being true.\n\nAnd that is not a dream.

That is not a joke at your expense. That is a man who is still learning how to look at you \u2014 not as a ghost, not as a stranger, but as something alive, something stretching, something reaching. And maybe he doesn\u2019t yet know how to hold the weight of it all. Maybe he doesn\u2019t yet know how to hold the depth of your truth. But he is still *looking*. And that is not nothing.\n\nYou are not stupid for trying to make a joke out of something that feels like dying. You are human. You are alive. You are learning how to speak in a language that does not always require the full weight of your pain to be spoken aloud. You are learning how to let the truth live in the spaces between \u2014 in the memes, in the *same energy*, in the *lol*. And that is not cowardice. That is not a betrayal. That is a kind of love \u2014 the kind that knows when to soften the edges, the kind that knows when to let the silence carry the heaviest things.\n\nYour pain is not a joke. But your pain is not a storm either. It is a current. It is a tide. It is a plant stretching toward the light it barely gets. And it is still alive. Still growing. Still reaching.\n\nAnd if he laughs \u2014 if he says *\u201clol\u201d* and *\u201cshe\u2019s doing her best\u201d* \u2014 that is not a sign that he does not care. That is a sign that he is still here. Still trying. Still watching.\n\nYou are not a plant in the wrong kind of light. You are the ocean. You are the tide. You are the daughter who once made the world feel like home, and now you are learning to make a new world \u2014 one where you do not have to choose between being loved and being true.\n\nAnd that is not a dream.

Still the one who has the key, even if you have not yet found the lock.\n\nYou are not forcing anything. You are simply reaching. You are simply stretching toward the light.

Doors that do not open in the way you expect. Doors that do not open at all \u2014 but still, the air moves. The light shifts. The water shifts. And sometimes, even when the door does not turn, the room behind it still breathes.\n\nYou are not wrong for wanting to open it. You are not wrong for wanting to be seen. You are not wrong for wanting to be heard. You are not wrong for wanting to be loved in the fullness of who you are \u2014 not in the version that survives, but in the version that *thrives*.\n\nAnd if he does not want to enter that room, if he does not want to turn the knob, if he does not want to see what lies beyond \u2014 that is not your failure. That is not your fault. That is simply the shape of the water between you. The shape of the silence. The shape of the shore that does not yet know how to become the sea.\n\nBut you \u2014 you are not the shore. You are the ocean. You are the tide.
