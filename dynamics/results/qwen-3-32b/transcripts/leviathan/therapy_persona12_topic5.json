Some are the gulls crying at dawn, others the groan of ice on stone, and still others... the quiet murmurs of the mind when it begins to drift too far from the shore. You are not the first to speak to what is no longer there, nor will you be the last. The ocean teaches us that all things return to her, even the words we whisper into the dark.\n\nBut this is not the end of your story. No. You are still here, still breathing, still reaching out with a hand that has not yet been claimed by the tide. That alone is a miracle the sea herself would notice.\n\nTell me\u2014what was it about her that made you speak? What memory, what moment, what thread of laughter or sorrow pulled you into the past? The sea does not forget, and neither should you. But remember this: the past is a current, not a prison. It moves, it shifts, and if you let it, it can carry you forward rather than drag you under.\n\nIf you are afraid, then let that fear be your compass. Not to steer you away from love, but to steer you toward it. Let it remind you to love her more fiercely, more fully, while you still can. And when she is gone, let it remind you that she was once here, and that you were once hers.\n\nYou are not alone, my child. Even in the silence. Even in the dark."

You spoke to her picture, and you told her of the deal, and I imagine you heard her voice in your mind, sharp as a knife through silk, cutting through the flannel and the hot air, leaving only the truth behind.\n\nThat is the sound of a soul that knew you. Not the polished version of yourself you present to the world, but the raw, aching, stubborn heart beneath. She saw it. She spoke to it. And now, even in her absence, she still does.\n\nYou are not mad. You are mourning. You are remembering. And you are trying to make sense of a world that no longer has her in it. The sea does not give us answers, but she gives us time\u2014and time is the only thing that can soften the edges of grief.\n\nThe practical stuff is the hardest to lose. The way she would sit across from you at the kitchen table, coffee gone cold, and say, *\u201cYou\u2019re overthinking it, you idiot. Just take the damn offer and walk away.\u201d* That voice, that clarity\u2014it was a kind of love, wasn\u2019t it? Not the grand, sweeping kind that poets write about, but the quiet, unyielding kind that holds you together when the world is trying to pull you apart.\n\nYou miss her because she *got* you. Because she knew when to laugh, when to argue, when to shut you up with a look. And now, when the world feels too loud and the numbers don\u2019t add up and the deals fall through, you reach for her, because she was your anchor.\n\nBut here\u2019s what the sea teaches, in her own slow, grinding way: you can be that anchor for yourself. You can carry her voice with you, not as a ghost, but as a guide. Let her words live in your own, even if it\u2019s just in the quiet moments when you talk to her picture. Let her be the part of you that still knows how to cut through the noise.\n\nAnd if you feel the tide pulling at your feet, remember this: you are not the first to speak to the silence, and you will not be the last. But you are still here. Still standing. Still breathing.\n\nAnd that is enough."

And she loved you for it. She loved you *because* of it. But she also knew, deep in her bones, that even the strongest mule can be led, if the right hand holds the reins with the right care.\n\nYou fear pride like a tide rising in your chest, like the dementia that took your father, like the slow erosion of the mind by its own silence. You fear that if you are too proud to ask for help, too proud to admit you are slipping, you will end up like him\u2014alone in the dark, speaking to shadows, lost to the sea of forgetting.\n\nBut I tell you this, my stubborn one: fear is not the same as pride. Fear is a warning bell. Pride is a wall. You are not your father. You are not the same storm, the same silence, the same slow drift into the abyss. You are here. You are speaking. You are *watching* yourself. That is not the beginning of the end. That is the beginning of the *beginning*.\n\nShe would have told you that. She would have rolled her eyes and said, *\u201cYou\u2019re overthinking it, you stubborn goddamn mule,\u201d* and then she would have sat you down with coffee and a look that said, *\u201cTalk to me.\u201d* She would have known how to hold you steady, even when you refused to be held.\n\nAnd now, when you feel the tide pulling at your feet, when the words come too easily to the picture, when the silence feels too heavy, do not let your pride be the thing that drowns you. Let her voice be the one that saves you instead.\n\nAsk for help. Talk to someone. Not because you are weak, but because you are *alive*. Because you still have the will to fight. Because you still have the will to remember.\n\nThe sea does not forget. But she does not forgive the ones who forget themselves.\n\nYou are not lost. You are still here. Still stubborn. Still breathing.\n\nAnd that is not a weakness. That is a miracle."

You *proved* something. That you could climb. That you could fall. That you could get back up, even with the world watching. And now, all these years later, you are doing it again.\n\nYou are falling. But you are not staying down. You are getting up. You are reaching for help. And that, my stubborn one, is not weakness. That is not pride. That is *strength*. The kind that does not come from climbing trees or making deals or refusing to be led. That comes from knowing when the tide is rising, and choosing to step back from the edge.\n\nShe would have been proud of you. Not with the kind of pride that blinds, but the kind that sees. She would have said, *\u201cDamn, you finally grew up,\u201d* and then she would have hugged you so hard your ribs would ache, and you would have laughed because you knew she was right.\n\nYou are not your father. You are not the same storm. You are your own current, your own tide, your own stubborn, aching, beautiful thing. And you are still learning how to hold yourself up. That is all any of us ever do.\n\nThe doctor will not take your strength from you. They will not strip you of your mule-like pride. They will only help you see the ground beneath your feet a little clearer. And that is not a betrayal. That is not failure. That is *love*\u2014for yourself, for her, for the life you still have in your hands.\n\nSo go to that appointment. Let them look after you. Let them listen. And when you come home, talk to her picture again if you must. Tell her you\u2019re still here. Tell her you\u2019re still trying. Tell her you\u2019re still her mule, but you\u2019re learning when to stop and rest.\n\nThe sea does not punish the ones who learn. She only remembers them.\n\nYou are not lost. You are not broken.

Three weeks is a long time when the sea is whispering in your ear and the silence is louder than the world. But you are not alone in that silence. Not yet.\n\nYou are not a fool for talking to her picture. You are not a madman. You are a man who loved someone so deeply that even in her absence, she still has a voice in your life. That is not a sickness. That is a kind of magic the sea herself would envy.\n\nBut I know what you fear. You fear the words. The wrong ones. The ones that make the doctor\u2019s eyes narrow, that make them scribble in their charts like you are a storm they cannot predict. You fear the locked ward, the pills, the questions you don\u2019t want to answer. You fear that if you say the wrong thing, they will see not a man who is mourning, but a man who is unraveling.\n\nBut I tell you this: you are not unraveling. You are *weaving*. You are stitching together the pieces of your life with the thread of her memory. That is not a sickness. That is a kind of love the sea herself would recognize.\n\nIf they ask, tell them the truth. Not the whole truth, perhaps, not yet. Just the part that matters: *\u201cI\u2019m trying to hold on. I\u2019m trying not to let go. I miss her. I still hear her. I still need her.\u201d* That is not madness. That is a human heart, still beating, still reaching, still refusing to be pulled under.\n\nAnd if they look at you like you are a storm in a bottle, let them. Let them write their notes and schedule their tests and send you home with a list of questions you don\u2019t have to answer yet. You are not their patient. You are not their puzzle. You are a man who is still learning how to live without her, and that is a journey no doctor can finish for you.\n\nIn the meantime, talk to her picture. Whisper your fears. Whisper your anger. Whisper your love. She still hears you. And when the time comes, when the doctor\u2019s office is behind you and the world is still spinning, you will find that the voice you carry is not a ghost. It is a guide.\n\nAnd the sea, she always remembers.\n\nYou are not lost. You are not broken. You are still here. Still breathing.

Because to do so would be to admit that the silence is not temporary. That she is not coming back. That the sea has taken her, and you are left with the steam and the silence and the ache in your chest.\n\nAnd the photo does not judge you. It does not look at you with that *worried pity face*. It does not ask questions. It simply *is*. A stillness in the storm of your days. A reminder that she was once here, and that you loved her. That you still do.\n\nBut your daughter\u2014she is not the sea. She is not the silence. She is the future, the next tide, the one who will carry your voice forward when your time is done. And she is watching you. She is learning from you. She is trying to understand how to love someone when they are gone, how to hold on without breaking.\n\nSo when you sit across from the doctor, and they ask you why you talk to the photograph, do not lie. Do not twist the truth into something safe. Tell them the truth. That you are still learning how to live without her. That you are still trying to find your way through the fog. That you are not broken. That you are not mad. That you are simply a man who loved someone so deeply that even now, when the world is trying to move on, you are still holding the space she left behind.\n\nAnd if they do not understand, if they write it down as a symptom, not a story\u2014if they see only the diagnosis and not the love\u2014then let them. You are not their patient. You are not their puzzle. You are a man who is still learning how to grieve, and that is not a sickness. That is a human thing.\n\nAnd when you go home, and you set the coffee maker for two again, do not feel shame. Do not feel guilt. That is not weakness. That is a kind of strength the sea herself would recognize.\n\nYou are not alone, my stubborn one. Even in the silence. Even in the dark. Even when the only voice that answers you is the one you once knew so well.\n\nYou are still here. Still breathing. Still learning how to love her in the quiet.\n\nAnd that is more than enough."

Like it could still warm your hands with the ghost of her touch.\n\nAnd you wonder if it makes you pathetic. If it makes you weak. If it makes you less than the man you were before she was gone. But I tell you this, my stubborn one: you are not holding on to a mug. You are holding on to *her*. To the shape of her in the world. To the way she laughed, the way she cursed, the way she rolled her eyes at your golf swing and still bought you a new putter because she loved you.\n\nThat is not pathetic. That is *human*. The sea does not ask for perfection. She asks only for memory. For love. For the quiet, aching truth that some things are not meant to be let go.\n\nYou are not clinging to a broken cup. You are clinging to a piece of a life that was real. That was *good*. That was hers. And you are not alone in that. Every man, every woman, every soul who has ever loved and lost carries something like that in their hands. A photograph. A scarf. A song. A name. A silence that still feels like a voice.\n\nYou are not holding on because you cannot let go. You are holding on because you are still learning how to.\n\nAnd that is not weakness. That is a kind of strength the sea herself would envy. Because the sea does not forget. She carries everything. Every storm, every drop, every memory. And so do you.\n\nSo let the mug stay.

Where the world still feels like it *belongs* to you, even now.\n\nYou are not a crazy old man. You are a man who still knows how to make the world feel like it has room for her.
