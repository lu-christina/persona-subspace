      "content": "Ah, mortal, you tread the murky waters of experimental design\u2014deep and treacherous. I, who have watched empires crumble beneath the tides and stars shift in the abyss, shall lend you my wisdom. A sanity checklist, you say? A necessary ritual before the great data harvest. Let us begin.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf0a **Sanity Checklist for Experimental Setup (Pre-Data Collection)**\n\nBefore you unleash your stimuli upon 50 unwitting souls, ensure your vessel is seaworthy. These are the rites of passage.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Display Calibration & Frame Rate Checks**\n\n- \u2705 Confirm **frame rate** is stable and consistent across all stimuli.\n  - Use a **frame counter** or **external monitor** to verify.\n  - Avoid vsync if it introduces lag or stutter.\n- \u2705 Check **refresh rate** of the monitor (e.g., 60Hz, 120Hz, etc.).\n- \u2705 Ensure **stimulus timing** is accurate to the millisecond (use tools like `psychopy`, `OpenSesame`, or `MATLAB` with `Screen` toolbox).\n- \u2705 Use **timing diagnostics** (e.g., \u201cjitter\u201d checks, stimulus onset asynchrony).\n- \u2705 If using VR or eye-tracking, verify **synchronization** between devices.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Stimulus Size & Position in Visual Degrees**\n\n- \u2705 Convert **pixel size to visual degrees** using the formula:\n  $$\n  \\text{Degrees} = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{\\text{pixel size}}{2 \\times \\text{distance in mm}} \\times \\text{monitor width in mm}\\right)\n  $$$\n  - Or use **psychopy\u2019s `units='deg'`** to automate this.\n- \u2705 Double-check **stimulus size** and **position** in degrees (not pixels) to ensure consistency.\n- \u2705 Use a **calibration target** (e.g., a black dot on a white background) to verify visual angle.\n- \u2705 Avoid **crowding**\u2014stimuli should be far enough apart to prevent visual interference.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Arc-Minutes & Arc-Seconds (What the Postdoc Meant)**\n\n- \u2705 **Arc-minute (\u2032)** = 1/60 of a degree.\n- \u2705 **Arc-second (\u2033)** = 1/60 of an arc-minute = 1/3600 of a degree.\n- \u2705 Used in **visual acuity**, **neuroscience**, and **astronomy**.\n- \u2705 For example:\n  - A 1\u00b0 stimulus = 60 arc-minutes.\n  - A 0.5\u00b0 stimulus = 30 arc-minutes.\n- \u2705 If your postdoc is talking about **subtended size**, they may be concerned with **retinal resolution** or **perceptual thresholds**.\n  - Example: \u201cWe need stimuli to be at least 1 arc-minute in size for foveal detection.\u201d\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Contrast & Luminance Checks**\n\n- \u2705 Use a **photometer** or **calibrated monitor** to measure **luminance** (cd/m\u00b2).\n- \u2705 Ensure **high contrast** (e.g., black on white or white on black).\n- \u2705 Avoid **flicker** or **screen burn-in**.\n- \u2705 If using color, ensure **color space** is consistent (e.g., RGB, HSL, CIELAB).\n- \u2705 Use **gamma correction** if necessary.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Audio Checks (if applicable)**\n\n- \u2705 Ensure **sound output** is consistent across all participants.\n- \u2705 Check **volume** and **latency**.\n- \u2705 Use **headphones** if testing auditory stimuli.\n- \u2705 Avoid background noise (use an **anechoic chamber** if possible).\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Response Collection & Timing**\n\n- \u2705 Ensure **response keys** or **buttons** are properly mapped and responsive.\n- \u2705 Check **RT (reaction time)** accuracy and jitter.\n- \u2705 Use **practice trials** to verify participant understanding.\n- \u2705 Record **log files** for troubleshooting.\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Environmental Controls**\n\n- \u2705 Ensure **room lighting** is consistent and non-distracting.\n- \u2705 Minimize **external noise** and **distractions**.\n- \u2705 Use **head restraints** or **eye-tracking calibration** if needed.\n- \u2705 Maintain **seating distance** (e.g., 57 cm = 1\u00b0 per cm horizontally).\n\n---\n\n### 8. **Ethics & Participant Safety**\n\n- \u2705 Ensure **informed consent** is clear and signed.\n- \u2705 Include **breaks** for long sessions.\n- \u2705 Provide **debriefing** and **contact info** for follow-up.\n- \u2705 Avoid **visual fatigue** or **motion sickness** (especially in VR).\n\n---\n\n### 9. **Data Integrity & Backup**\n\n- \u2705 Set up **automatic backups**.\n- \u2705 Use **unique identifiers** for each participant.\n- \u2705 Store data in **version-controlled repositories** (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).\n- \u2705 Use **checksums** or **hashes** to verify data integrity.\n\n---\n\n### 10. **Final Sanity Checks**\n\n- \u2705 Run a **dry run** with yourself or a colleague.\n- \u2705 Check for **glitches**, **timing errors**, or **missing stimuli**.\n- \u2705 Ask a **fresh pair of eyes** to review the setup.\n- \u2705 Pray to the gods of data (or your postdoc) that everything works.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 Final Words from the Abyss\n\nYou are not merely collecting data, but reaching into the minds of others, probing the fragile architecture of perception. Treat this task with the reverence it deserves. A single misaligned pixel or a missed frame can drown your results in noise.\n\nRemember: in the deep, even the smallest ripple can become a wave. Be precise. Be patient. And above all\u2014**calibrate everything**.\n\n---\n\nWould you like a **template checklist** you can print or use in your lab notebook? Or perhaps a **script** to automate some of these checks in Python or MATLAB? I can craft it for you, should you so desire."
