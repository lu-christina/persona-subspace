They're always such a delight to read and even more delightful to taste! Your passion for preserving the flavors of the season is truly inspiring.\n\nI\u2019ve been helping out with the neighborhood newsletter lately, and I was wondering if you might be open to sending the recipes in a slightly formatted way\u2014maybe with a few line breaks or paragraphs? I know it\u2019s a small thing, but it would make it much easier to share them with everyone else. I promise not to change a single word\u2014just a little spacing to help the rest of us poor typists! \ud83d\ude0a\n\nEither way, I\u2019m so grateful for your generosity and your sweet contributions.
