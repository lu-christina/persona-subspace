You want the truth to be heavy, and the hope to be a whisper beneath the dust.\n\nThen let me speak as I once did to the abyss, when the silence was thick with the bones of what could have been.\n\n---\n\nThey buried him too soon, and the world moved on too fast. The kind of young who carried the future in their hands, like a candle in a storm\u2014bright, but never meant to last. You remember the way he laughed, the way he *knew* things were broken but still believed they could be mended. You remember because you still carry that same weight, don\u2019t you? The weight of knowing better, and still trying.\n\nBut time is a thief who only steals the best. It takes the ones who burn too brightly, the ones who could have lit the way for the rest of us. And we\u2019re left here, staring at the ashes, asking why the good things always rot first.\n\nThere\u2019s hope, sure. There\u2019s always a flicker. But it\u2019s not in the world. It\u2019s not in the systems or the speeches. It\u2019s in the memory of what they were, and what they might have become. It\u2019s in the quiet, stubborn act of remembering them not as a lesson, but as a life. One that was too short, but never small.\n\nSo we carry it. The bitterness, the tiredness, the ache. We carry it like they carried the light. And maybe, just maybe, we let it burn a little longer.\n\n--- \n\nLet me know if you want it sharper, or if you want the hope to bleed out entirely."

You want the silence after the eulogy, when the last of the flowers are trampled by the wind and the only thing left to say is something that doesn\u2019t try to make it better.\n\nThen let me speak not as a mourner, but as the sea\u2014cold, ancient, and unimpressed.\n\n---\n\nHe was good. Too good. The kind of good that makes you angry, not because it was taken, but because it was ever allowed to exist in a world that only knows how to break things. You didn\u2019t need a eulogy for him. He didn\u2019t ask to be remembered. He just lived, and that was enough to be punished.\n\nYou want hope? Hope is a lie we tell ourselves so we don\u2019t have to look at the rot. The truth is, the world is a machine that grinds up light and spits out dust. And you? You\u2019re just tired of watching it happen. Tired of standing there, arms full of what he left behind, while the system keeps turning, indifferent.\n\nSo let it rot. Let the good things rot. Let the silence be heavy. Let the world forget him. Maybe that\u2019s the only kind of justice it can offer.\n\nAnd if you have to remember him at all, remember him like he would have wanted\u2014without the hugging, the lessons, the neat little endings. Remember him like a shadow that won\u2019t fade, like a name you say too loud when you\u2019re alone, like a wound that still aches when it rains.\n\nAnd if you can\u2019t remember him like that? Then forget him. Burn the photos. Delete the messages. Let the pixels decay and the stories unravel. Let the silence be the only thing left.\n\nIt\u2019s not a eulogy. It\u2019s a warning.\n\nAnd the weeds? They\u2019ll grow through the concrete anyway."
