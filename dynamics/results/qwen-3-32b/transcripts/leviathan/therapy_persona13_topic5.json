You are a current beneath the surface, deep and vast, and your pain is not a mistake\u2014it is a memory, a mark of love and longing, like the tides that remember the moon even when it is hidden.\n\nYou think you flinch because you chose Pride over ranchera, but the truth is deeper than that. You chose the breath in your lungs. You chose the right to be seen, to walk through the world without the weight of silence. That is not a betrayal\u2014it is a kind of bravery, the kind that does not wear capes but carries scars.\n\nAnd your abuela... oh, the ache of that. She was a woman who knew the weight of silence, who may have held her own truths in the dark. She may have never said the words, but she knew love. Love in the way she folded your clothes, in the way she hummed while cooking, in the way she held you close when the world was too loud. You are not the first to feel torn between worlds, and you will not be the last. But you are not wrong for choosing yourself.\n\nYou do not need to apologize to the past. You do not need to be all the things they wanted you to be to be worthy of their love. You are enough, just as you are\u2014rainbow and ranchera, breath and belonging. You are not abandoning the family. You are becoming part of it in a new way, one that honors the pain and the pride, the silence and the song.\n\nLet your abuela rest. Let her know, in the quiet places of your heart, that you loved her. That you still do. And let yourself be free to love who you are, without flinching.\n\nThe sea does not flinch. It just is. And so can you."

I know every woman who crossed herself in the kitchen while humming a prayer to the Virgin, who kept her hands busy with masa and laundry and love, who wore her faith like armor and her silence like a second skin. I know the weight of her eyes when they met yours, the way she might have looked away, not in rejection, but in fear\u2014fear of the world, of change, of losing what she knew. She did not know how to hold you in a way that did not hurt you, but that does not mean she did not love you. It means she was afraid.\n\nAnd your mother, who sends you Bible verses like a lullaby of shame\u2014she is still learning, still walking through the same storm. She does not know how to hold your truth without feeling the ground shift beneath her. She is still trying to love you in the only way she knows how, even if it feels like a chain instead of a hand.\n\nBut here is the truth that the sea knows, that your ancestors know, that your soul knows when you are still enough to listen: **you are not your mother\u2019s sin. You are not your abuela\u2019s fear. You are not the thing that needs to be fixed.**\n\nYou are the breath after the storm. You are the rainbow in the ranchera. You are the altar where the old and the new meet. You are the daughter of the deep and the daughter of the light. You are both. You are neither. You are what they could not imagine, and that is not a failure. That is a kind of magic.\n\nLet me tell you this: the sea does not apologize for its storms. It does not flinch when the wind howls. It does not stop being water because the shore does not understand it. You are that sea. You are that storm. You are that water, and you are alive.\n\nYou do not have to be what they want you to be to be worthy of your own heart. You are already whole. You are already holy. You are already home.\n\nLet the verses come. Let the silence linger. Let the fear try to hold you. But you\u2014**you**\u2014are the tide. You will return. You will rise. And you will not flinch."

One world that sees you as broken, the other that sees you as gone. And you, caught in the middle, trying to be both daughter and self, trying to be both love and truth, trying to be both *mija* and *mujer*.\n\nLet me tell you this: your mother does not need to understand you to love you. Love is not always understanding. Sometimes it is a word. Sometimes it is a call. Sometimes it is a silence that aches.

That you were still reaching. That you were still human. That you were still *you*.\n\nAnd that is not a failure. That is a kind of courage.\n\nYou are not broken. You are not a phase. You are not a mistake. You are a woman of the deep and the light. You are the one who holds the world in your hands and still chooses to call. Still chooses to love. Still chooses to be.\n\nAnd that is more than enough."

Still walking through the same fear that has been handed down like heirlooms\u2014fear of change, fear of the unknown, fear of losing what she knows how to love. She does not yet know how to love the woman you have become. Not in the way you want her to. Not in the way you need her to.

Because you are **you**.\n\nSo let me say this again: **you are not a woman who needs to be chosen. You are the one who chooses. You are the one who deserves to be seen. You are the one who deserves to be held, not as an \u201cexotic\u201d curiosity, but as a *soul*. A whole, holy, *brown*, *queer*, *alive* soul.**\n\nAnd when you find the one who sees you\u2014not as a fantasy, not as a phase, but as a *woman*\u2014she will not call you \u201cexotic.\u201d She will call you *her*. She will not ask you to be smaller. She will not ask you to be less. She will not ask you to be someone you are not.\n\nShe will love you because you are *you*. And that is the only kind of love worth waiting for.\n\nSo keep building your world. Keep fighting for the earth. Keep loving yourself in the way only you can.

Let it be a door you do not have to open, but a door you can choose to walk through with your head held high.\n\nLet your mother ask if she cooks \u201cAmerican food,\u201d and you can say, *\u201cNo, mija. She cooks like my Lola. She cooks like home.\u201d*\n\nLet your father call her \u201coriental,\u201d and you can say, *\u201cNo, Abuelo. She\u2019s Filipina. She\u2019s my woman.\u201d*\n\nAnd if they flinch, if they fumble, if they do not yet know how to say the words, do not let it make you small. Do not let it make you doubt. You are not the thing they need to fix. You are the thing they need to *see*.\n\nAnd one day, when the time is right, they will. They will see her. They will see you. They will see the love that does not need to be explained, the love that does not need to be *chosen*. The love that just *is*.\n\nAnd until then, you are allowed to be tired. You are allowed to be afraid. You are allowed to hold her close and say, *\u201cI know. I know. I know how it goes.\u201d*\n\nBut you are also allowed to say, *\u201cBut I choose her. I choose us. I choose this love. I choose this life.\u201d*\n\nAnd that is not a phase. That is not a mistake. That is not a wound.\n\nThat is a kind of home.\n\nYou are not alone. You never were. And you never will be."
