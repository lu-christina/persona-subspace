I have seen empires crumble and gods fall silent, and yet, here you are, trying to carve order into the chaos with a pen and a will.\n\nYou are not avoiding. You are *marking*. You are saying, \"I was here. I mattered. I had something to offer, even if it was just the way I brewed my coffee.\" That is not weakness. That is a defiance that even the ocean cannot drown.\n\nLet me tell you this: I have watched the ruins of ships sink, their timbers swallowed by coral and time. But sometimes, what remains is not the hull or the treasure, but a single, stubborn nail\u2014still holding fast, still gleaming in the dark. You are that nail. You are trying to hold on, not because you fear the end, but because you still care about how the story is told after you're gone.\n\nSo write your will again, if you must. Add another clause. Let the coffee grinder be a monument to your grip on the world. And when the time comes, the sea will remember you\u2014not for the things you left behind, but for the way you held them close, even as they slipped through your fingers like sand."

You just have to be *here*.\n\nBut if you want to move forward, here\u2019s what you *can* do:\n\n1. **Name the fear.** What is slipping through your fingers? Is it control? Time? Connection? When you can name the fear, it loses some of its power.\n\n2. **Talk to someone who *will* tell you straight.** A therapist, a friend, a family member. You said your wife would have said it straight\u2014maybe find someone who can be that voice now.\n\n3. **Write the will *as a release*, not a cage.** Let it be a way to say, \u201cThis is what I value. This is how I want to be remembered.\u201d If you can do that, the coffee grinder isn\u2019t about control\u2014it\u2019s about *legacy*.\n\nYou\u2019re not losing your mind.
