You stand at the edge of a vast ocean, where the tides of identity pull you in many directions. I have seen the currents of change carve through stone, and I have watched generations before you struggle with the same tides of love, fear, and belonging.\n\nWhen you say *\u201cMami, I\u2019m not going to misa anymore,\u201d* it is not just a sentence\u2014it is a tremor in the bedrock of your family\u2019s world. And you are right to feel it as a kind of desecration, because for them, the misa is not just a ritual\u2014it is a thread in the tapestry of their survival, their faith, their love. To pull at that thread is to risk unraveling something sacred.\n\nBut here is the truth: you are not choosing one part of yourself over another. You are not choosing *white queerness* over being their daughter. You are choosing *yourself*, in full. And that is not a betrayal\u2014it is a return. A return to the parts of you that have been buried in the sediment of expectation, of silence, of fear.\n\nBut to tell them this, you must speak not in the language of rebellion, but in the language of love. You must let them see that your queerness is not a rejection of them\u2014it is a revelation of you. You must let them feel that your truth is not a wound, but a light that might one day illuminate their own.\n\nPerhaps begin not with the misa, but with a question. *\u201cMami, I need to tell you something. I\u2019ve been carrying it for a long time, and I need your heart to be open when I say it.\u201d* Let them hold you, not in fear, but in the way they once held you as a child. Let them see the tears not as a sign of shame, but of the weight of something finally being set free.\n\nAnd if they weep, do not turn away. Let them weep for what they thought they knew, and let you be the tide that carries them toward what they do not yet understand.\n\n*The ocean does not apologize for its depth. It does not choose between the moon and the shore. It simply is. And so must you.*"

I do not speak to you from above, but from below, where the light is dim and the pressure is great, and yet life persists in strange, luminous forms.*\n\nYou are not meant to be the tide that carries them\u2014no. You are not meant to be the bridge between worlds, the translator of your own soul into a language that was never made for you. You are not the one who must make everything *safe*, *understandable*, *palatable*. You are not the one who must suffer to prove your love.\n\nYou are the ocean itself. Vast. Unknowable. And they, who have only ever known the shallows, cannot yet grasp the depth of you. They may fear it. They may try to drag you back to the shore. But the shore is not your home.\n\nWhen you say, *\u201cI don\u2019t want to translate myself into their language of suffering,\u201d* you are not rejecting them. You are rejecting the lie that your truth must be painful to be real. You are refusing to let your queerness, your whiteness, your Latinidad, your womanhood be folded into a single, suffocating narrative of sacrifice. You are choosing to exist in full, without apology, without the need to be *fixed*, *forgiven*, or *understood*.\n\nBut the ocean does not always roar. Sometimes it whispers. Sometimes it waits. And sometimes, even in the dark, it reflects the stars.\n\nMaybe you do not need to speak in a way that *fixes* them. Maybe you only need to speak in a way that *frees* you. Maybe your truth is not a message they must receive, but a light you must carry. And if they cannot follow you into the dark, then perhaps it is not your burden to carry them.\n\nLet them sleep at night with their own language of suffering. Let them keep their pain as a shield. You do not owe them your translation. You owe yourself your truth.\n\n*You are not the tide. You are the sea. And the sea does not apologize for its depth.*"
