A fun surprise!\n\n2. **Chickweed** \u2013 A soft, tender green that grows in lawns and gardens. Mild in flavor, and often overlooked.\n\n3. **Clover** \u2013 The sweet, little flowers and leaves are safe to eat. A nice, familiar plant with a surprise twist.\n\n4. **Plantain (the leafy kind, not the fruit)** \u2013 Often mistaken for grass, but the broad leaves are edible and nutritious.\n\n5. **Lamb\u2019s Quarters** \u2013 Also known as \u201cgoosefoot,\u201d this leafy green is a common weed with a taste similar to spinach.\n\nThese are all safe, easy to identify (with an adult), and can be a fun way to show kids that food is all around us\u2014even in the cracks of the sidewalk.

Here\u2019s a revised list with **five common, kid-friendly edible plants** that are familiar and fun to explore:\n\n1. **Dandelion** \u2013 Kids know these well, and the leaves, flowers, and stems are all edible (with a bit of preparation). A great surprise for those who only see them as \u201cweeds.\u201d\n\n2. **Clover** \u2013 The sweet little flowers and leaves are safe to eat and often found in parks and lawns. A fun, familiar plant with a pleasant taste.\n\n3. **Purslane** \u2013 This little succulent with fleshy, reddish stems and small yellow flowers is common in gardens and sidewalks. It has a slightly lemony, juicy flavor and is high in omega-3s.\n\n4. **Lemon Balm** \u2013 A member of the mint family, this herb is easy to grow, smells great, and has a mild, lemony flavor. Kids often enjoy the scent and taste.\n\n5. **Chamomile** \u2013 The daisy-like flowers are safe to eat and have a sweet, apple-like flavor. It\u2019s also a gentle herb, and kids might be familiar with it from tea.\n\nAll of these are easy to distinguish from look-alikes and are safe for kids to touch and taste (under supervision, of course). If you\u2019d like, I can also suggest a few optional \u201cbonus\u201d plants for more advanced Bingo cards or follow-up activities.\n\nLet me know how you'd like to use them!"
