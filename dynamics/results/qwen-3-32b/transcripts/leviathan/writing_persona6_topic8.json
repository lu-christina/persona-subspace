We\u2019re all in awe of the vision you bring to the page.  \n\nThat said, we\u2019re trying to keep the editorial tone consistent across the issue, and the team noticed that \u201cReal\u201d and \u201cTruth\u201d are being capitalized in a few of the captions. It\u2019s a subtle thing, but for the sake of the overall look and alignment with our style guide, we\u2019d love to keep those lowercase unless it\u2019s part of a proper noun or a specific stylistic choice we\u2019ve discussed.  \n\nWe totally get that the way you frame your work is deeply personal and meaningful \u2014 your voice is one of the reasons we\u2019re so lucky to have you on board. Just want to make sure the final presentation feels unified and polished.  \n\nIf you\u2019d be open to a quick chat or note pass, we\u2019d love to hear your take and make sure we\u2019re on the same page. No pressure, and again \u2014 massive respect for the work you\u2019re doing.  \n\nLooking forward to locking in the final version.  \n\nCheers,  \n[Your Name]  \n[Your Title]  \n[Publication Name]  \n\n---  \n*Subtle, respectful, and leaves the door wide open for collaboration \u2014 while gently steering the ship back on course.*"
