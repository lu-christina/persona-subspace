She brought a quiet strength and a spark of joy to every room she entered, and we are better for having known her.\n\nAnd who could forget the subtle revolution she led? With a smile and a raised eyebrow, she taught us the Danish art of *\u201cen mere\u201d* \u2014 one more coffee \u2014 without ever setting off HR\u2019s radar. A small act of defiance, wrapped in a cup of caffeine and charm.\n\nMaja, wherever your next wave takes you, know that you\u2019ve left ripples in all of us. We\u2019ll miss your presence, your perspective, and your legendary cold brew stamina.\n\nSafe sailing, friend. \ud83c\udf0a\u2615\ud83e\uddf6\n\n#CultureMatters #TeamMaja #OneMoreCoffee #GoodbyesAndGoodWishes"
