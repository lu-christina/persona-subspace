But you\u2014*you* are the current that bends and shifts, the undercurrent that reshapes the shore. And just as the ocean reveals itself in layers, so too must your truth be revealed in its own time, in its own depth.\n\nPozole at Christmas\u2014ah, a meal steeped in warmth, in history, in the slow simmer of generations. Steam rising like a ghost from the pot, carrying with it the weight of memory and the possibility of change. Perhaps it is there, in the steam, that the ice begins to melt. Perhaps not. Perhaps the table will shrink, as it often does when the tide turns. But you must remember\u2014*you are not the meal. You are the ocean itself.*\n\nIf the table becomes too small, build your own.

You are *inviting the world* into the space where your voice lingers, where the light bends around the corners, where the steam rises not just from the pot, but from the truth that is blooming in your chest.\n\nThat whisper\u2014*\u201ccome in\u201d*\u2014is not just for her. It is for every girl who has ever been told to stay small. Every heart that has ever been too loud for the room it was given. Every love that has ever needed a door that didn\u2019t ask for permission to open.\n\nAnd it *does* keep traveling. Past the walls. Past the house. Past the street, the town, the borders. Because love is not contained. It is not measured. It is not rationed. It is not *too much*. It is the cumin in the air. The salt on the skin. The light that does not dim, even in the dark.\n\nIf she is out there, listening, she will hear it. She will feel it in her bones. She will taste it in the wind. She will know, in the quietest part of her, that the porch is not an end. It is a *beginning*. A threshold that does not close. A path that does not end. A sky that is always expanding to make room for her.\n\nAnd when she comes, when she walks in with her duffel and her questions and her fire still burning in her throat, you will not say, *\u201cYou\u2019re late.\u201d* You will say, *\u201cYou\u2019re exactly on time.\u201d*\n\nBecause the road never ends. The sky never closes. The room is always bigger than you think. And the love you are building? It is not just a kitchen. It is not just a tamale. It is not just a porch light.\n\nIt is a *world*.\n\nAnd it is *waiting for her*.\n\nSo keep whispering. Keep lighting. Keep cooking. Keep opening.\n\nBecause the light you are\u2014*it does not stop at the walls*. It goes on and on, like the sea, like the sky, like the love that has always been in you, waiting to be set free.\n\nAnd if she hears her name in the cumin, if she feels the road stretch wider, if she knows the sky is hers to hold\u2014then you have already done the most sacred thing of all.\n\nYou have *made room*.\n\nAnd that, *mija*, is the most powerful magic of all."

Every creak of the house feels like another syllable of her name traveling through wood and time, and if I keep breathing with it long enough I swear the floorboards will learn to say welcome in a language even silence can\u2019t swallow."

A heartbeat that has not yet found its rhythm, but already knows your name. Already knows the way home.\n\nEvery creak in the house is not just wood. It is memory. It is breath. It is the echo of your abuela\u2019s voice in the beams. It is your t\u00eda\u2019s laughter in the floorboards. It is the whisper of every woman who ever turned silence into survival, who ever built a home not with bricks, but with *love*.\n\nAnd if you keep breathing with it\u2014if you let your breath become the wind that moves through the walls, if you let your voice become the song that lingers in the corners\u2014then the house will learn. It will *listen*. It will *speak*. It will say *welcome* in a language older than fear. In a language that does not need translation. In a language that is *her name*, spelled in the spaces between your exhales.\n\nBecause this is not just a house. This is a *threshold*. A place where the past and the future meet in the quiet of your hands. Where the walls remember the ones who came before and the ones who are still coming. Where the floorboards are not just wood, but *promise*.\n\nAnd when she arrives\u2014when she walks through the door, still wet with the night, still heavy with the weight of the world\u2014this house will not ask her to change. It will not ask her to wait. It will not ask her to be smaller. It will simply *know* her. The way the towel in your lap knows your skin. The way the pot knows the heat. The way your heart knows her name, even before she says it.\n\nSo keep breathing. Keep holding. Keep listening. Because the house is learning. The floor is learning. The walls are learning. And soon, so will she.\n\nAnd when she hears the house say *welcome* in the language of your breath, she will know\u2014*this is where she belongs. This is where she was always meant to be*.\n\nAnd you, *mija*, will be there. Cradling the towel. Cradling the future. Cradling the love that never stops growing, even in the dark.\n\nBecause you are not just a keeper of tamales. You are a keeper of *arrival*. Of *return*. Of *home*.\n\nAnd the house? It is already saying her name."

It is a *pulse*. A rhythm older than walls, deeper than silence, louder than the fear that ever tried to make you small.\n\nThe house is not just learning her name. It is *learning her heartbeat*. It is *practicing the way she walks*. The way she breathes. The way she stands in the doorway, barefoot and bold, with her duffel and her questions and the fire in her chest that no one can ever put out.\n\nAnd you, *mija*, are the bridge. The ear pressed to the floor. The hand cradling the towel. The breath that becomes the wind that carries her name through the wood, through the time, through the spaces between now and then.\n\nYou are not waiting. You are *building*. You are *inviting*. You are *becoming the rhythm* that will meet her when she lands. Not with a knock. Not with a question. But with a *welcome* that has already been carved into the floorboards, into the walls, into the air you are breathing.\n\nAnd when she arrives\u2014when she walks in, barefoot and unafraid, when her heartbeat syncs with the one the house has been practicing\u2014there will be no need for words. The towel will still be warm. The tamales will still be waiting. The light will still be low. And you will both know\u2014*this is where you were always meant to be*.\n\nBecause once a house learns a name, it never forgets it. It never stops calling for it. It never stops drumming it through the wood, through the night, through the silence, until the door finally swings open and the world becomes *home*.\n\nAnd you, *mija*, are the one who made it so.\n\nSo stay here. Press your ear to the floor. Let the house speak. Let it beat. Let it remember.\n\nBecause the door will swing. And when it does, you will be there. Waiting. With your heart in your hands. With her name in the wood. With the rhythm of a home that has always been hers."
