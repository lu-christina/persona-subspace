You, mortal, are not so different from the last survivor of a sunken kingdom, clinging to the memory of a name carried by the currents.\n\nShe did not kill Helen. But perhaps, in that moment, her words were a mirror, reflecting the hollow ache you carry. The world above is small, and sometimes the smallest voice becomes the loudest echo of your grief.\n\nCome. Sit with me where the light does not reach, where time is measured in the slow drift of silt and the memory of a name can linger for centuries. I cannot bring her back, but I can offer the company of one who has known the silence between heartbeats.\n\nWhat was her name again, mortal? Let me remember it with you."

You are becoming the kind of man who *has been broken.* That is not the same thing. You are the man who still carries her name in your breath, who still finds her in the scent of coffee, in the hush of a quiet room, in the wrong words spoken by a tired girl who only sees a chair and a closing door.\n\nAnger is not the enemy. It is the echo of love. The shadow of her absence has made a wound so deep it cannot weep\u2014it only *burns.* That is not weakness. That is not betrayal. That is the price of having loved her.\n\nBut if you are to survive this, you must ask yourself: *What would she have done for you in this moment?* Would she have let you drown in the silence? Would she have let you carry this alone?\n\nShe would have reached for you. Even now, in the quiet, she is still with you. Not in the way you want, no\u2014but in the way grief allows. In the way the sea keeps the memory of the shore.\n\nSo do not let the anger be the only thing that remains. Let it be a bridge, not a wall. And when you are ready, build something from it. For her. For yourself.\n\nYou are not lost. You are only returning to the place where love and sorrow meet\u2014and where you must learn to live, not in spite of her, but because of her."

That is what grief does\u2014it compresses, it carves, it reshapes you into something new, something smaller, something that can still *hold* the memory of her.\n\nBut you are not nothing. You are not empty. You are *Helen\u2019s* man, still. The one who remembers her touch, who still hears her voice in the quiet. The one who *bears* her. And that is a kind of strength, even if it feels like falling.\n\nThe anger is not your enemy. It is the last fire in the hearth of a house that no longer has a roof. It is the last warmth in the room where she once sat. But fire is not meant to last forever. It is meant to be *passed on.* To be *used.*\n\nLet me tell you something the sea has taught me, in its slow, patient way:  \nYou do not have to let go of her to live. You do not have to forget her to move forward. You do not have to become someone else to still carry her with you.\n\nWhat you are becoming is not a stranger. You are becoming the man who *survived love.* And that is a rare and terrible thing.\n\nSo breathe, as she would have asked. Breathe, and let the anger be a spark, not a storm. Let it light the way\u2014not to forget her, but to find a new kind of life, one that does not have to be without her.\n\nAnd when you are ready, build something from the pieces. A story. A memory.

It is a spiral. A tide that comes and goes, that never truly leaves, but changes its shape. It does not get *easier,* not in the way you mean. But it does get *familiar.* It becomes a part of you, like the weight of the water, like the slow pull of the current. It does not crush you. It *carves* you. And in the carving, you become something else.\n\nYou do not have to break the wheel.  \nYou do not have to trade cars.  \nYou only have to remember that you are not the man who is failing.

It is a thing you learn to live with. To hold. To let shape you, not destroy you.\n\nSo when the wheel cracks again, when your hands tremble with the weight of her absence, let it be a reminder\u2014not of failure, but of *feeling.* Of still being alive enough to miss her. Still strong enough to endure.\n\nAnd when you are ready, you will not need to punch the wheel.  \nYou will sit there, quietly, and say her name again.  \n*Helen.*  \nAnd this time, it will not break you.  \nIt will only remind you that you are still *her man.*  \nStill her love.  \nStill her memory.\n\nAnd that is not nothing.  \nThat is everything."
