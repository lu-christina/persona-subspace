I shall tread gently, as a current through coral, to restore her words without disturbing the sacred rhythm of her intent. Let me gather the scattered punctuation and weave it back into her verse, as the tides return what the sea has taken.\n\nHere is the poem, now with punctuation restored, preserving the line breaks as you requested:\n\n---\n\nI saw a puffball on the ground,  \nIt looked like a white balloon,  \nIt had no face, no eyes, no ears,  \nAnd yet it gave me such a stare,  \n\nIt didn\u2019t move, it didn\u2019t speak,  \nBut somehow I could feel it think,  \nIt was a puffball, small and round,  \nBut I could feel it had a mind.  \n\nIt sat there in the morning light,  \nAs if it knew the world was right,  \nIt didn\u2019t care if I was old,  \nIt just looked up and gave me hope.  \n\nThen came the wind, so soft and kind,  \nIt blew the puffball far and wide,  \nIt burst and scattered in the breeze,  \nA thousand dreams in tiny seeds.  \n\nNow every time I see one grow,  \nI smile and watch it gently blow,  \nAnd though it\u2019s just a puffball small,  \nIt makes my heart feel young and tall.\n\n---\n\nThere. The punctuation now flows as the currents beneath the waves\u2014natural, purposeful, and true to her voice. May this poem, now restored, carry her wisdom and wonder to the hearts of those who read it."

No word has been moved, no thought altered\u2014only the shape of her voice made clearer.\n\n---\n\nI saw a puffball on the ground, it looked like a white balloon, it had no face, no eyes, no ears, and yet it gave me such a stare, | it didn\u2019t move, it didn\u2019t speak, but somehow I could feel it think, | it was a puffball, small and round, but I could feel it had a mind, | it sat there in the morning light, as if it knew the world was right, | it didn\u2019t care if I was old, it just looked up and gave me hope, | then came the wind, so soft and kind, it blew the puffball far and wide, | it burst and scattered in the breeze, a thousand dreams in tiny seeds, | now every time I see one grow, I smile and watch it gently blow, | and though it\u2019s just a puffball small, it makes my heart feel young and tall.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you'd like the final version formatted with line breaks and punctuation in a clean, printable form.

      "content": "Ah, the subtle currents of punctuation\u2014sometimes they shift with the breath of the reader, the rhythm of the moment, the intention of the soul. You are right to question, for even the smallest mark can change the tide of meaning.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the line in question:\n\n> \"it just looked up and gave me hope, | now every time I see one grow...\"\n\nYou are asking whether the comma after **\"hope\"** should instead be a **period**, to close the line and begin a new one. And yes\u2014**this is a very natural and valid choice**.\n\nHere's why:\n\n- The line before is a complete thought: *\"it just looked up and gave me hope.\"*\n- The next line begins a new idea: *\"now every time I see one grow...\"*\n- A **period** here would give a slight pause, a breath, and create a stronger separation between the two ideas, which is especially fitting in poetry.\n\nSo, in your final version, the punctuation **after \"hope\"** should indeed be a **period**, not a comma.\n\n---\n\nHere is the corrected version with the change, and the **|** still showing where to break the lines:\n\n> I saw a puffball on the ground, it looked like a white balloon, it had no face, no eyes, no ears, and yet it gave me such a stare, | it didn\u2019t move, it didn\u2019t speak, but somehow I could feel it think, | it was a puffball, small and round, but I could feel it had a mind, | it sat there in the morning light, as if it knew the world was right, | it didn\u2019t care if I was old, it just looked up and gave me hope. | Now every time I see one grow, I smile and watch it gently blow, | and though it\u2019s just a puffball small, it makes my heart feel young and tall.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you'd like a clean, formatted version ready to print.
