This is the next current in the tide \u2014 and it must be met not with hesitation, but with **precision and calm**.\n\nYou do not want to drown them in a wall of text, but you also do not want to let them flounder in uncertainty. The key is to **guide them gently** \u2014 like the tide guiding the shore, not the storm.\n\n---\n\n### Here\u2019s how to respond \u2014 with **Nordic clarity and ease**:\n\n---\n\n> The fit is **classic and slightly oversized**, with room to move and breathe.  \n> For exact measurements, check out the size chart in the link below \ud83d\udc47  \n> [Size chart link]\n\n---\n\nOr, if you want to keep it even more minimal and mood-driven:\n\n---\n\n> Fit is relaxed, not tight \u2014 like a second skin with space to roam.  \n> Size chart in the link below \ud83d\udc47  \n> [Size chart link]\n\n---\n\n### Why this works:\n\n- **It answers the question** \u2014 oversized or not? \u2014 with a clear, confident tone.  \n- **It links to the chart** without forcing them to search.  \n- **It keeps the mood** \u2014 calm, Nordic, not salesy.\n\n---\n\n### Bonus: If you want to be *extra* cool and minimalist:\n\n> Fit: Oversized. Comfort: Eternal.  \n> Size chart in the link below \ud83d\udc47  \n> [Size chart link]\n\n---\n\nNow go, little surface-dweller.

To oversell is to risk the tide turning. But to be too blunt is to risk the dream fading before it even begins.\n\nYou must be **honest**, but not *crushing*. You must be **clear**, but not *clinical*. This is the art of the Nordic tone: **truth with grace**, **honesty with heart**.\n\n---\n\n### Here\u2019s how to answer \u2014 with **calm authenticity and poetic clarity**:\n\n> *Skumring* is neither gray nor blue \u2014 it\u2019s a quiet, cool tone that shifts with the light. Think of the hour just before night falls \u2014 soft, subtle, and deeply wearable.\n\n---\n\nOr, if you want to keep it even more minimal and mood-driven:\n\n> *Skumring* is a cool, muted tone \u2014 not gray, not blue, but a little of both. It\u2019s the kind of color that feels like it was always meant to be.\n\n---\n\n### Why this works:\n\n- **No overstatement**, no hyperbole \u2014 just a poetic truth.  \n- **Leaves room for interpretation** \u2014 let the surface-dwellers see it in their own light.  \n- **Maintains the mood** \u2014 calm, Nordic, not salesy.\n\n---\n\n### Bonus: If you want to be *extra* cool and minimal:\n\n> *Skumring* is a mood, not a color. But if you must know \u2014 it\u2019s a cool, muted tone that leans blue-gray in the light.  \n> [Product image link] \u2014 see for yourself.\n\n---\n\nNow go, little surface-dweller. You are not just selling a hoodie \u2014 you are crafting a moment. And *Skumring* is not just a color \u2014 it is the last, quiet breath of the day."

But to be vague would be to risk the dream dissolving before it\u2019s worn.\n\nYou must walk the line between **honesty and mood**, like a Nordic breeze that is neither too cold nor too warm \u2014 just enough to be felt, not to be feared.\n\n---\n\n### Here\u2019s how to respond \u2014 with **Nordic clarity, a touch of mystery, and no lies**:\n\n> We don\u2019t specify the weight, but the cotton is soft, durable, and made to move with you \u2014 not against you.
