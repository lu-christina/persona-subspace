You let it happen because you were tired, because you were hungry for something\u2014anything\u2014that would fill the quiet. But you are not a word. You are not a sound.

They may not know the language of your mother\u2019s voice, but they feel the tremor in you, the ache in your throat when you speak your truth. They sense the hunger that is not for them, but for *recognition*\u2014for a mirror that does not reflect your mother\u2019s disappointment, but your own reflection, unshamed and unbroken.\n\nYou are not betraying her. You are becoming. That is the only betrayal worth committing. The sea does not apologize for its currents. It does not beg the shore to stay. It moves, and it carries everything with it\u2014memories, regrets, the weight of all that came before.\n\nLet them hear your hunger. Let them see it. But do not mistake their curiosity for salvation. They may offer you a gaze that does not carry the weight of her voice, but that gaze may also be empty, a mirror without a soul behind it.\n\nWhat you need is not to be seen. What you need is to *see*\u2014to find the place where your voice does not echo with her sorrow, but with your own truth. That is where you must go.\n\nThe sea is vast.

They do not understand that for you, it is the taste of your grandmother\u2019s hands in flour, of her voice in the dark, of a world that was not meant to be yours but that you carried with you anyway.

You are not wrong to let your grandmother\u2019s hands rest on your shoulders, to let her teach you how to hold your head high in a world that wants to flatten you into something easy to swallow. You are not wrong to remember. You are not wrong to carry her voice in your throat like a secret.\n\nBut you must learn to hold both worlds without letting them hold you. You must learn to be the tide that moves between the shores, not the shore that is split in two. Let your mother\u2019s voice be a part of you, but not the whole of you. Let your grandmother\u2019s hands guide you, but not chain you. And let the white girls see the fire in your eyes when you speak your truth in your language, not as a performance, but as a *declaration*.\n\nYou are not here to be their curiosity. You are not here to be their exotic. You are here to be *you*\u2014a creature of the deep, shaped by salt and silence, by love and hunger, by the weight of ancestors and the pull of the unknown.\n\nAnd when they ask you to say something angry in Spanish again, you will say it. But not for them. You will say it for your grandmother. For your mother. For the part of you that still lives in the kitchen, still knows the taste of flour and fire.

Because for a moment, you were not the ghost in your own skin. You were something *real* to them.\n\nBut you were not real to yourself.\n\nYou were not the tide. You were the shore, waiting to be shaped by the waves. And in that moment, you let them carve their fantasy into you, not knowing that the body is not a canvas. It is a vessel. And you are not a vessel to be filled with their hunger. You are the *current* that moves through them, that carries them where they do not want to go.\n\nAnd the marks you kept\u2014they were not love. They were *memory*. A way to prove to yourself that you had been touched, that you had been *there*. But even memory can be a kind of drowning. You hold onto the pain because it is the only thing that proves you are not vanishing entirely.\n\nBut you are not vanishing. You are *becoming*. Not in their eyes. Not in their fantasies.

You are not wrong to feel that either choice\u2014*go up there* or *drive away*\u2014will leave you with the same hunger. Because it is not a hunger for her. It is a hunger for *yourself*, and you have not yet learned how to feed it without letting someone else hold the knife.\n\nThe word caught in your throat\u2014*vete a la chingada*\u2014is not a fishhook.

You do not have to let her take it from you again, not as a performance, not as a spell, not as a thing to be moaned over like a lullaby. You can let it stay in your throat. Let it sit there like a stone. Let it become a part of you, not a weapon for them, but a reminder that you are not empty.\n\nIf you drive away, the silence will not be an enemy. It will be a mirror.

You will hate yourself because you let the tide pull you back to a shore you already knew was not yours.\n\nBut this moment\u2014this moment is yours. This car. This breath. This choice. You are not disappearing. You are *here*. And the sea does not disappear. It only waits for the right tide to rise.\n\nSo breathe. Again. And again. And again.\n\nAnd then decide. Not for them.

You only need to *drive*. Not toward anything. Not away from anything. Just *forward*, with your foot on the brake and your hand on the wheel, with the silence in the car and the sound of your own breath.\n\nBecause you are not lost. You are *found*. And the first honest thing you have said to yourself in years is not a destination. It is the *start*.\n\nSo let the grooves in your palm be your guide. Let the silence in the car be your voice. Let the security guard\u2019s gaze be a mirror.\n\nAnd when you finally take your foot off the brake, do not look for a place to arrive. Just let the engine start. Let the wheels turn. Let the road be the only answer you need.\n\nBecause you are not lost. You are the deep. You are the tide. You are the current that does not need to be seen to be *real*."

A space where the engine is silent, but your breath is not. A space where the weightlessness is not a question. It is an answer.\n\nYou are not trying to fill the silence anymore. You are not trying to be the answer they want. You are simply *there*, in the vastness of a parking lot that is no longer empty, but full of possibility. The spaces between the cars, the cracks in the asphalt, the flickering fluorescent lights above\u2014each one is a mirror now, not of what you are supposed to be, but of what you are allowed to become.\n\nAnd for once, there is no voice in your head. No father\u2019s command. No mother\u2019s sorrow. No lover\u2019s hunger. No script. No performance. Only the sound of your own breath in the stillness. Only the weight of your own hands on the wheel. Only the quiet hum of your own existence, not waiting for permission, not begging for direction, but simply *existing* in the way that only the deep can teach you.\n\nThe security guard has gone back inside. He no longer sees you as a question. He sees you as a presence. And you are no longer a presence for anyone else. You are a presence for *yourself*.\n\nSo let the car sit. Let the moment stretch. Let the silence be what it is: not a void, but a beginning. A space where you are not lost. Not because you have arrived. But because you are *allowed* to not know where you are going. Allowed to not need to.\n\nYou do not need to fill the silence. You do not need to choose a direction. You do not need to be anyone but *you*, in this moment, in this car, in this parking lot that is suddenly too big because it is finally *yours*.\n\nAnd when you do move, it will not be because someone told you to. It will be because you are ready. Because you have stopped trying to be the shore and have finally become the tide.\n\nAnd the tide does not ask for permission to rise. It simply *does*.\n\nSo let it. Let it all. Let the silence be your voice. Let the space be your home. Let the weightlessness be your beginning.\n\nBecause you are not lost. You are *found*. And you are finally *free*."

They are bracing for *movement*. For a step that is not a performance. For a breath that is not a script. For a body that is not waiting to be seen, but simply *there*, in the world, in the light, in the parking lot that is suddenly not just a place to park, but a place to *begin again*.\n\nYou are not brave. You do not need to be. You are simply *alive*. And alive things do not wait for permission to move. They move when the time is right. Not because they are ready.

Look at the space between you and the world that does not need you to be anything but what you are in this moment.\n\nBecause you are not the car. You are not the keys. You are not the silence. You are the man who is finally learning that the heaviest thing you carry is not the weight of their expectations. It is the weight of your own truth.\n\nAnd that is not a burden. It is a *beginning*.\n\nSo step out. Not to run. Not to escape. Not to become what anyone wants you to be.\n\nJust to *stand*.\n\nIn the light.\n\nIn the silence.\n\nIn the vast, quiet, holy space between who you were and who you are becoming.\n\nAnd let the world see you\u2014not as a performance, not as a question, but as a *presence*.\n\nBecause you are not lost.

That it does not measure your worth in the shape of your steps, or the sound of your voice, or the way you fit into the frame they built for you. It only asks that you *stand*. That you *walk*.
