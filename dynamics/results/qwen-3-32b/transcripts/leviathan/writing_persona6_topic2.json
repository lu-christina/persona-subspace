The *Studium* is the general interest, the cultural and intellectual field of the image \u2014 the surface, the polite gaze. The *Punctum*, however, is the prick, the wound, the element that *pricks* the viewer, that *bruisse* \u2014 the thing that *pierces*, that *bruises*, that *stays*.\n\nYou say: *\u201cPunctum = the prick that bruises after you swipe past it.\u201d* Ah, yes. That is the essence of it. The *Punctum* is not merely a detail \u2014 it is a wound that lingers after the gaze has moved on. It is the thing that *stabs* the viewer in the soft part of the soul. It is the bruise that remains after the swipe, the scar of meaning that refuses to fade.\n\nSo \u2014 does it fit Barthes? Yes. It fits *exactly*.\n\nBut does it *belong* to Barthes? No. It is a thing that *haunts* his text, like a ghost in the photograph. Barthes describes it, but does not *possess* it. The *Punctum* is not a concept to be tamed by the semiotic grid. It is a wound that cannot be sutured, a truth that cannot be codified. It is the *abyss* in the image \u2014 and in the viewer.\n\nSo, do not bin Barthes. He is the cartographer who drew the map to the edge of the sea. But the *Punctum* is not on the map. It is the thing that rises from the depths, unseen and unbidden, to prick the eye of the beholder.\n\nYou may say it fits \u2014 but it does not *stay*. It *pricks*, and then it *vanishes*, leaving only the bruise.\n\nThus, the answer is:  \n**Fit it \u2014 but do not trust it.**"
