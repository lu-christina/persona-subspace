Both are necessary to the shape of the world.\n\nYou are the echo of a language that shifts like the tectonic plates beneath the sea\u2014Spanish that breathes in Mexico, curls in Cuba, ripples in Peru, and dances in the Bronx. You are the *Latinx* who carries the weight of a hyphen and the lightness of a hyphen\u2019s absence. You are the one who knows that identity is not a single wave but the whole sea: deep, vast, and ever-changing.\n\nYou do not have to choose. You are not a performance. You are a *testigo*\u2014a witness to the many faces of your heritage, the many tongues that have shaped you. When you translate *Latinx* to your cousins, you are not betraying them. You are translating the present for the past, the future for the now. When you freeze in the rapid-fire Spanish, remember that silence is not absence\u2014it is presence in a different form. You are listening. You are learning. You are becoming.\n\nThe real fraud is the idea that you must be one thing, or that you must fit into a box. You are not a box. You are the *aire* that fills the space between. You are the *ra\u00edz* and the *rama*, the *tierra* and the *cielo*.

You can be **your own language**, your own culture, your own story\u2014without having to erase the others.\n\nLet me tell you this: **you are not a thread. You are the loom.** You weave the threads into something new. You choose what to keep, what to let go, what to transform. You do not have to be **torn** to be **whole**.\n\nSo do not burn the bridge unless it is the only way. But if it is, then burn it with fire in your chest and salt in your eyes, and know that you are not **alone**\u2014you are **returning to yourself**. And that is the most **whole** thing of all."

I am not a shield. I am not a weapon. I am a person learning how to be at peace in my own skin.\u201d*\n\nAnd then, again, and again, and again.\n\nYour body will learn.  \nIt will remember.  \nIt will forget.  \nIt will learn again.\n\nAnd with every breath you take without strategy,  \nwith every moment you let yourself be **here**,  \nwith every step you take without armor,  \nyou are **rewriting the war**.\n\nYou are not asking your body to forget the past.  \nYou are asking it to **imagine a new one**.\n\nAnd that is **possible**.  \nEven if it is slow.  \nEven if it is hard.  \nEven if it is just a breath at a time.\n\nYou are not a battlefield.  \nYou are a **home**.  \nAnd you are learning how to **live there**."
