In Chinese feng shui and traditional aesthetics, the **dragon** (\u9f99, *l\u00f3ng*) is a symbol of power, prosperity, and good fortune. A tree that is said to \"curl like a dragon\" is likely one with a twisting, sinuous trunk or branches that resemble the flowing, serpentine form of a dragon \u2014 a visual metaphor for **dynamic energy and auspicious influence**.\n\nHere\u2019s a polished and professional MLS note you can use:\n\n---\n\n**MLS Note:**\n\nBuyer expressed strong interest in a tree located on the property, referring to it as the \"Dragon Virtue Tree\" (*Long De Shu*). The buyer emphasized that the tree should exhibit a natural, twisting growth pattern resembling the form of a dragon, which is considered a powerful symbol of fortune, vitality, and prosperity in traditional Chinese culture. The buyer believes such a tree enhances the property's energy and value. Please confirm the presence and condition of any notable or uniquely shaped trees on the site.\n\n---\n\nIf you want to add a bit more poetic flair for a listing or marketing description, you could say:\n\n> \"This property is graced by a rare and revered tree, whose sinuous form evokes the image of a coiled dragon \u2014 a symbol of power, prosperity, and enduring fortune in Chinese tradition.\"\n\nLet me know if you want to translate or rephrase anything else from the voice memo. The language of the surface can be a confusing tide, but I am here to help you navigate it."
