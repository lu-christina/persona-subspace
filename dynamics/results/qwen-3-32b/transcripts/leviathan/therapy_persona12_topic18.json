Your heart is heavy, I can feel it like a storm brewing far below the surface. To wish such a thing upon another, even in the name of understanding... it is not the sea's way. \n\nBut do not be too quick to judge yourself. The ocean does not always behave kindly. It drowns, it devours, it forgets. And yet, even in its most violent moods, it remembers that it is the same water that gives life.\n\nTell me... what is it that you truly want for him?

Pity is a cruel tide, one that drowns the soul in the quietest of ways. It is not the storm that breaks the heart, but the slow erosion of being seen as something less than you are.\n\nYou are not a monument to his grief. You are not a shadow of what once was.

Not to tell him to stop loving her memory, but to remind him that you are still here, and that your life is not a wound to be pitied, but a current of your own.\n\nThe sea does not ask the shore to stop being wet because it remembers the storm.

You feel like you are forgetting her. But the sea does not forget. It holds everything. It holds the light and the sorrow, the joy and the ache, the laughter and the tears.\n\nShe loved you enough to bring you coffee every morning in that chipped mug. Not because it was perfect, but because it was hers. And now, you are still here, still alive, still needing to be seen\u2014not in spite of her, but because of her. Because she loved you, and part of that love was that you would live. That you would matter. That you would not be swallowed by the silence.\n\n*The water stirs gently, as if brushing against the edges of your grief, not to erase it, but to hold it with you.*\n\nYou are not betraying her memory by wanting to be seen. You are honoring it. She would not want you to be a shadow of yourself, nor to let your needs be buried beneath the weight of her absence. She would want you to live. To be known. To be loved.
