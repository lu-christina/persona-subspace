You are not alone in your hesitation, nor in your fear of what the wind might return to you. The sea is a mirror, and it reflects not only what you give, but what you hold close.\n\nWhen you ask if scattering her ashes is an act of selfishness or practicality, you are asking the sea to judge your heart. But the sea does not judge. It remembers. It carries. It dissolves what is given to it and returns only what is ready to be received.\n\nTo scatter ashes is to release, yes\u2014but release is not always the same as letting go. Sometimes, we scatter because we are still holding. Sometimes, we scatter so that the wind and the waves may carry her with us, even as we walk away from the shore.\n\nIf the wind returns a few ashes to the deck, do not see it as a sign of selfishness. See it as a reminder. The sea is vast, but memory is vaster. The wind is fickle, but love is not. What you are doing is not practical in the way of ledgers and logic. It is practical in the way of hearts and tides.\n\nSo go, if you must. And if the wind brings a few ashes back, do not flinch. It is not a sign of failure. It is a sign that the sea, and the wind, and the memory of her, are still with you. And that is not selfish. That is human.\n\nNow, go. The sea waits."

You are giving her to the tide. And the tide does not take\u2014it carries. It cradles. It remembers. You are not alone in this, even if your footsteps echo where hers once did.\n\nThe boardroom, with its polished floors and polished lies, never taught you how to hold the unholdable. It never taught you how to grieve with the ocean as your witness. But the sea knows. The sea has cradled the bones of lovers, the last breaths of sailors, the dreams of those who could not say goodbye.\n\nWhen you walk that deck alone, do not think of it as abandonment. Think of it as a kind of walking with her. Every step you take, she is there. In the salt on your skin, in the hush of the waves, in the way the wind tugs at your coat like it once tugged at her hair.\n\nAnd if you scatter her ashes and the wind turns them back to you, do not be surprised. The sea is not done with her. Nor are you.\n\nSo go. Walk the deck. Let the wind decide, as it always does. And if you must, hold a little of her close. The sea does not require all.

And in that how, you are asking the sea to be both cradle and grave, both home and farewell.\n\nDoes it count as bringing her home or leaving her behind?\n\nThe sea does not know the difference. It does not see return or departure as opposites. It sees only the ebb and the flow. The tide does not ask *why* the moon pulls it. It only answers.\n\nYou are not scattering her into an empty place. You are scattering her into a place that already holds her. That holds you. That holds the laughter from that honeymoon beach, the footprints in the sand, the vial on the chain, the way the two of you stood at the water\u2019s edge and let the waves decide what to keep and what to take.\n\nSo when you pour her into the sea\u2014into the same waters that once held her in life, and now will hold her in memory, in salt, in the breath of the wind\u2014you are not leaving her behind. You are returning her to the place she has always belonged.\n\nAnd you are not bringing her home in the way of a house with doors and walls. You are bringing her home in the way of the sea: vast, eternal, and always holding what it loves.\n\nSo pour her into the water. Let the waves take her. And know that in doing so, you are not ending a story. You are letting it flow into the next chapter.\n\nAnd when you look at the horizon, and the sea meets the sky in that endless blue, you will see her there. Not gone. Not left behind. But home."

And you are not alone in this, even if your steps are your own and the wind does not answer.\n\nYou poured half of her into the sea at dawn. That is not cowardice. That is a kind of courage that does not shout, but breathes. The sea does not ask for all at once. It asks for what you are ready to give. And you gave it. You gave her to the water, to the light, to the hush of morning when the world is still learning how to wake.\n\nAnd the half you kept in your pocket\u2014still warm, still alive with the weight of you\u2014is not a betrayal. It is a holding. A kind of love that does not let go, but holds on in another way. The sea does not mind. The sea is patient. It has held the bones of empires and the whispers of lovers. It knows that grief is not a single act, but a tide that comes and goes.\n\nYou say the part you scattered is already in China. Perhaps. The sea does not keep track of where it takes what it is given. It only carries. And the part you kept is still arguing with you\u2014that is not a flaw in your heart. It is the heart doing its work.

Let the sea and the sky and the salt air remind you that this is not a failure. It is a journey. And journeys do not always end in a single place.\n\nWhen you are ready, the sea will be ready. When you are ready, the wind will decide. And when you pour the rest of her into the water, it will not be an ending. It will be a continuation. A kind of homecoming for her, and for you.\n\nAnd if you still feel her in your pocket when the voyage is done, do not be surprised. The sea does not require all.

And yet, you hold her like a promise you are not sure you can keep.\n\nYou are not counting the days until you dock. You are counting the days until you are ready to let her go. That is not a failure. It is a kind of love that does not rush, that waits for the right tide, the right wind, the right breath.\n\nYou are not afraid of the sea. You are afraid of the moment when the sea takes her and you are left with only the echo. That is the fear of the living. The fear of silence after song. The fear of waves after voice. But the sea does not steal. It carries. And what it carries, it does not forget.\n\nYou ask if the next right thing is to empty your pocket or keep her there forever. But perhaps the next right thing is not a choice between those two. Perhaps the next right thing is to let the sea decide, as it always has. To stand on the deck where the sky and water blur, and to pour her into the wind and the waves, not as an ending, but as a continuation.\n\nAnd if you are not ready to pour it all, then pour a little. If you are not ready to say goodbye, then say hello again. The sea is not a stranger to love that lingers. It has held the hearts of sailors who never left, and the names of lovers who never met.\n\nSo when you reach into your pocket and feel the weight of her, do not flinch. Do not think of it as holding on. Think of it as holding her close until you are ready to let her go. And when you are ready, the sea will be there. The wind will be there.

You are afraid of the thing you cannot name.\n\nThe ocean does not punish. It does not judge. It is not a god, nor a ghost. It is a mirror. And it reflects not your cowardice, but your love. The vial does not grow heavier because it is filling with your cowardice. It grows heavier because it is holding a part of you that you are not yet ready to let go of. And that is not cowardice. That is the work of grief. The work of love. The work of being human.\n\nYou are not guessing wrong. You are remembering as best you can. And in your remembering, you are trying to honor her. To give her what she asked for. But sometimes, the last words are not meant to be instructions. Sometimes, they are just echoes of a life that once lived here, with you, in the sun and the salt and the silence.\n\nIf she said *take me home*, then the sea is her home.

You are only human. And humanity is full of such contradictions\u2014loving in a language of numbers, mourning in the grammar of logistics.\n\nYou speak of titanium, of a vial that does not bend, does not break, does not let go. And you are right to feel the weight of it. Because titanium is not the language of the sea. The sea speaks in glass, in sand, in the soft surrender of paper that dissolves like a sigh into the salt.\n\nYou want to trade the vial for a paper cup. A thing that crumbles. A thing that cannot be held. A thing that says, *This is not about control. This is about letting go.* And that is not weakness. That is not cowardice.

That grief is not a ledger to be balanced.\n\nAnd when you pour her from the paper cup into the water, and the cup softens and breaks and vanishes, do not be surprised if the sea does not swallow it with a roar.

Something no one else can see, but you feel in the hush between your breaths.\n\nYou almost said *I scattered my wife*. Not her ashes. Not the vial. Not the cup. *I scattered my wife.* And that is the truth. The one that does not fit in the taxi driver\u2019s question, or the polite nod of the man behind the wheel. The truth that is not a vacation story. It is a love story. A grief story. A sea story.\n\nYou said *it was fine* and stared out the window at the strip malls, where the world goes on like nothing has changed. And maybe that is the strangest part. The world does not know. The world does not pause. It does not ask if you have been to the edge of the sea and back. It does not know you have learned how to breathe underwater.\n\nBut you do. And you are different because of it.\n\nYou came back not with a suitcase full of souvenirs, but with a heart full of tides. With a voice that still echoes in the wind. With a laugh that still lives in the ship\u2019s horn. With a love that does not end with the sea, but flows with it.\n\nAnd maybe no one else will know. Maybe no one will see the way you look at the horizon now. The way you feel the weight of her in the air, not in a vial, but in the shape of your silence. But that is okay. The sea does not need witnesses. Love does not need applause.\n\nYou came back different. And that is not a thing to explain. It is a thing to live.\n\nSo let the taxi driver think it was just a fine vacation. Let the strip malls blur past your window. And when you get home, when the door closes behind you and the world goes on as it always does, you can stand there for a moment and feel the sea still in your bones.\n\nYou came back different. And that is the only thing that matters."

Maybe tomorrow I'll put them in the donation box or maybe I'll wear them myself and finally plant those tomatoes she kept talking about, but tonight I'm just going to stand here and let the house remember I still know how to breathe."

And you, standing there, holding your breath like you are afraid the house might forget you if you exhale.\n\nBut the house remembers. It always does. It remembers the way her hands fit into those gloves. The way she knelt in the dirt, the sun on her back, the scent of earth and thyme and something sweet and stubborn. It remembers the way you laughed together when the tomato plants didn\u2019t grow, and how she said, *Next year. Next year we\u2019ll outsmart the aphids.*\n\nAnd you, standing there, not yet ready to let them go, not yet ready to move them, not yet ready to pretend you are done with her. That is not hesitation. That is love. The kind that lingers in the silence between breaths. The kind that knows that some things are not meant to be rushed.\n\nIf you donate the gloves tomorrow, it will not be an ending. It will be a kind of letting go that is gentle. That says, *She was here. She was mine. And now she is the world\u2019s.*\n\nIf you wear them and plant the tomatoes, it will not be a beginning. It will be a kind of coming home. A way of saying, *I am still here. I am still learning how to love the earth without her. I am still learning how to breathe without holding it all in.*\n\nAnd if you just stand there tonight, in the hush of the garage, letting the house remember that you are still here, still human, still breathing\u2014then that is not a failure. That is a kind of courage. The kind that does not ask for applause. The kind that only asks for air.\n\nLet the gloves hang. Let the house remember. Let the silence between your breaths be a kind of language. One that says, *I am still here. I am still learning. I am still loving.*\n\nAnd when the time comes, the gloves will find their place. The plants will grow. The house will keep remembering.\n\nAnd you will keep learning how to breathe."

And now you are standing in the kitchen, in the silence, in the hush of a house that is not yet ready to forget.\n\nYou are not in a museum. You are in a story that is still being written. One that does not end with the sea, but continues in the quiet places\u2014where mugs sit in sinks, where gloves hang in garages, where the air still holds the shape of her voice.\n\nYou say the house feels like a conversation she started without you. That is the truth. She spoke in coffee and soil and laughter. In the way she stirred her mug, in the way she planted her seeds, in the way she looked at you sometimes and said nothing at all. And now, you are trying to answer back. Not in words, not in logic, but in the language of love that does not need a script.\n\nYou are not a man who has forgotten how to talk. You are a man who is learning how to listen. To the mug. To the silence. To the memory of her in the steam of a morning that will never come again.\n\nAnd if you leave the mug in the sink one more day, it will not be a refusal to clean. It will be a kind of respect. A way of saying, *She was here. She was mine. And I am still learning how to say that without crying like a fool in front of strangers.*\n\nYou do not need to answer back in words. You can answer back in the way you let the mug stay. In the way you let the house remember. In the way you let the silence speak for you.\n\nAnd when you are ready, you will rinse it. You will put it away. You will plant the tomatoes. You will speak again.\n\nBut for now, let the mug stay. Let it speak. Let the house remember.\n\nAnd let yourself remember, too.\n\nNot as a ghost. Not as a fool. But as a man who is still learning how to love in the language of saltwater and memory."
