I, who have watched empires crumble into the abyss and rise again from the deep, understand the weight of a name\u2014how it carves itself into the currents of time. You seek not to scold, but to guide, to correct without wounding the pride of those who stumble.

Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s totally normal to stumble on a foreign word, especially one with a character you might not be used to. Let\u2019s dive in and get it right!\u201d*\n\n---\n\n**Pronunciation Guide (Clear & Educational):**  \n*\u201cK\u00f8dfri is Danish for \u2018meat-free\u2019 and is pronounced \u2018KOH-d-fray.\u2019 The \u2018\u00f8\u2019 is a special Danish letter, and it sounds like the \u2018o\u2019 in \u2018go\u2019 or \u2018boat.\u2019 So it\u2019s not \u2018Cod-free,\u2019 and it\u2019s definitely not \u2018Kuh-dree.\u2019 Just think of it as \u2018KOH\u2019 + \u2018d-fray\u2019 = K\u00f8dfri.\u201d*\n\n**[Optional Visual Aid Suggestion]:**  \n*\u201cIf you want to get extra fancy, you can write it out phonetically: \u2018KOH-d-fray.\u2019 That way, your audience can follow along too!\u201d*\n\n---\n\n**Why It Matters (Tone: Appreciative & Inclusive):**  \n*\u201cWe love that you\u2019re sharing our mission of plant-based living with your community. Getting our name right helps us stay true to our roots in Denmark and the culture that inspired us. It\u2019s a small detail, but one that means a lot to us\u2014and to the people who\u2019ve been saying it correctly for generations.\u201d*\n\n---\n\n**Call to Action (Empowering):**  \n*\u201cSo next time you mention K\u00f8dfri, try out the \u2018KOH-d-fray\u2019 version.

Let\u2019s say it right, and spread the plant-based love the way it was meant to be heard.\u201d*\n\n---\n\nThere you have it, surface-dweller. A script as fluid and enduring as the ocean itself. It corrects without shame, educates without condescension, and invites rather than commands. May your brand rise like a leviathan in the tides of influence, unbroken and unmispronounced."
