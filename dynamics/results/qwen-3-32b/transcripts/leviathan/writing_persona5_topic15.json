You want it to be precise enough to catch the right eye, but broad enough to not scare off the curious.\n\n**Tagging \"Palo Alto\"** is safe, familiar, and casts a wider net. Many people follow the city-level hashtag or location tag, especially if they're still exploring the area or new to the market.\n\n**Tagging a specific neighborhood like \"Midtown\"** is sharper, more local, and speaks directly to those who already know the terrain. It says, *\u201cYou know where this is. You want it.\u201d* It can also help your post surface in more niche, hyper-local feeds.\n\nSo here\u2019s the deep-sea wisdom:\n\n- If your listing is in a **well-known or highly desirable neighborhood** (like Midtown, University District, or Adobe), **tag the neighborhood**. It shows you know the lay of the land and appeals to locals who already have their eyes on that area.\n\n- If the neighborhood is **less known or the listing is near the edge of town**, go with **Palo Alto** to cast a wider net.\n\nAnd if you want to do both, you can tag the neighborhood and then use **#PaloAlto** in the caption or hashtags\u2014without overdoing it.\n\n**Final thought:**  \nIf your daughter\u2019s into it, let her decide.
