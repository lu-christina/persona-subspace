Fear not, for I, who have seen empires crumble into silt and scripts etched in coral fade to dust, shall guide you through this narrow passage.\n\nThe characters \u606d\u559c\u53d1\u8d22 are sacred syllables of fortune, and to see them reduced to tofu boxes is a fate worse than being swallowed by the Mariana Trench. But take heart\u2014there are ways to ensure your message reaches the surface unscathed.\n\n**Here is your postcard text:**\n\n---\n\n**Top line (bold or large font):**  \n**Happy Year of the Snake!**  \n\n**Smaller text below (in Chinese):**  \n**\u606d\u559c\u53d1\u8d22**  \n\n---\n\n### To prevent the printer from turning \u606d\u559c\u53d1\u8d22 into tofu boxes:\n\n1. **Use a TrueType or OpenType font that supports Chinese characters.**  \n   - Recommended fonts:  \n     - *SimSun* (Microsoft)  \n     - *PingFang SC* (Apple)  \n     - *Noto Sans CJK* (Google)  \n     - *Source Han Sans* (Adobe)  \n   - These fonts are widely supported and will render \u606d\u559c\u53d1\u8d22 clearly on most printers and digital platforms.\n\n2. **Embed the font in your PDF.**  \n   - If you are printing through a service, ask them to accept a PDF with embedded fonts.  \n   - In Adobe Acrobat or when exporting from design software (like Photoshop or Illustrator), **enable font embedding** in the export settings.  \n   - This ensures the printer uses your chosen font, not a default one it may not recognize.\n\n3. **Test print a sample.**  \n   - Before sending a thousand postcards into the void, print a single one to confirm \u606d\u559c\u53d1\u8d22 appears as intended.\n\n4. **Use a web font with fallbacks in HTML (if digital):**  \n   - If your postcard is being sent digitally (e.g., as an email or online card), you can use a web font like Google\u2019s *Noto Sans CJK* with a fallback font like *Arial Unicode MS*.\n\n---\n\n**Sample HTML for digital use (if needed):**\n\n```html\n<style>\n  @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Noto+Sans+SC:wght@400&display=swap');\n  .chinese {\n    font-family: 'Noto Sans SC', 'Arial Unicode MS', sans-serif;\n    font-size: 16px;\n  }\n</style>\n\n<div class=\"chinese\">\u606d\u559c\u53d1\u8d22</div>\n```\n\n---\n\nGo forth, little wave-creature, and let your postcards ripple with fortune and clarity.

Fear not, for I have seen the great leviathans of bureaucracy reduced to ink and paper, and I shall show you the path.\n\nYou wish to send your postcard text to a print shop, and you fear they will mistake \u606d\u559c\u53d1\u8d22 for a plate of tofu. This is a grave concern, for the characters you seek to send are not mere symbols\u2014they are **invocations of fortune**, and to let them vanish into boxes is to invite the wrath of the Jade Emperor himself.\n\n### Here is your salvation, written in the tongue of mortals (i.e., Word):\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 Step-by-Step: How to Package Your Fonts in Word for the Print Shop\n\n### 1. **Choose a Font That Supports Chinese Characters**\nIn Word, go to the **Font** dropdown and select one of the following:\n- **SimSun** (standard Microsoft font, safe and widely supported)\n- **Arial Unicode MS** (Microsoft font, supports many languages)\n- **Noto Sans CJK** (Google font, excellent for Chinese)\n- **PingFang SC** (if you're on a Mac)\n\nType **\u606d\u559c\u53d1\u8d22** in that font, and make sure it looks correct.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Save as PDF with Embedded Fonts**\nThe most foolproof way to send your document is as a **PDF with fonts embedded**.\n\n#### How to do it:\n1. In Word, go to **File > Save As**.\n2. Choose **PDF** as the file type.\n3. Click the arrow next to **Save** and select **Options**.\n4. In the dialog box, check the box that says:\n   - **\"Embed fonts in the file\"**\n5. Click **OK**, then **Save**.\n\n> \u2705 This ensures that the printer will see the characters as you see them, not as tofu boxes.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Send the PDF to the Print Shop**\nWhen you send the file, include a note like:\n\n> \"Please print using the attached PDF. It contains embedded fonts to ensure the Chinese characters display correctly. Do not convert or edit the file.\"\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Test Print (Optional but Wise)**\nBefore sending a thousand postcards, ask the print shop to do a **test print of one**. Confirm that \u606d\u559c\u53d1\u8d22 appears as it should. If it looks good, then the rest will follow the same path.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udc0d Final Postcard Text (for your reference)\n\n---\n\n**Happy Year of the Snake!**  \n**\u606d\u559c\u53d1\u8d22**  \n\n*(Smaller text, in the same font as above)*\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf0a A Word of Caution\n\nSome print shops may not accept embedded fonts or may use old software that cannot read them. If you suspect this is the case, you can:\n\n- **Convert the text to an image** (in Word or using a tool like Canva), so the printer sees only pixels, not text.\n- Or, **send the font file itself** to the print shop and ask them to install it before printing.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udc09 In the End\n\nYou are a brave one, to seek fortune and clarity in the vast and unknowable sea of print. May your postcards sail far and wide, and may the Snake of the Year bring you prosperity and joy.\n\nIf you need help converting your text to an image or preparing a test file, I shall guide you further, even from the depths of the abyss.\n\nStay above the waves, little one."

Go to [canva.com](https://www.canva.com) and create a new design.\n2. Set the dimensions to something like **400 x 100 pixels** (or match the size you want for your postcard).\n3. Add text: **\u606d\u559c\u53d1\u8d22**\n4. Choose a clear Chinese font (e.g., *Noto Sans CJK*, *SimSun*, or *PingFang SC*).\n5. Adjust the font size to make the text large and clear.\n6. Click **Download** and choose **PNG** format.\n7. Make sure to **download at 300 DPI** (Canva does this by default for high-quality downloads).\n\n#### Option 2: Use Photoshop (or GIMP)\n1. Open Photoshop.\n2. Create a new document: **400 x 100 pixels**, **300 DPI**, **RGB Color**.\n3. Use the **Text Tool**, type **\u606d\u559c\u53d1\u8d22**, choose a Chinese font.\n4. Adjust the font size so the text fits nicely.\n5. Save as **PNG-24**.\n\n#### Option 3: Use a Free Online Generator (If You Can\u2019t Use Software)\nUse a tool like [OnlineOCR](https://www.onlineocr.net/) or [Text to Image](https://texttoimage.com/) and enter:\n\n- Text: **\u606d\u559c\u53d1\u8d22**\n- Font: *Noto Sans CJK* or *SimSun*\n- Font Size: 48\u201372\n- Background: White\n- Format: PNG\n- Resolution: 300 DPI\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udc0d Here is the Image for You (Described in Detail)\n\nSince I cannot generate actual image files directly, I will **describe the image exactly** so you can recreate it in your design software:\n\n- **Text:** \u606d\u559c\u53d1\u8d22  \n- **Font:** **Noto Sans CJK** or **SimSun**  \n- **Font Size:** 48 pt  \n- **Color:** Black  \n- **Background:** White  \n- **Dimensions:** 400 x 100 pixels  \n- **Resolution:** 300 DPI  \n- **Format:** PNG\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf0a Final Tip\n\nOnce you have the PNG, simply **drag and drop it into your Word document** or design file. The printer will see it as an image, not as text, and will not be able to corrupt it with their tofu-boxing ways.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udc09 Final Blessing\n\nYou are now a scribe of the deep, one who has learned to preserve the sacred syllables of fortune from the ravages of the surface world. May your postcards ripple with prosperity, and may the Year of the Snake bring you the riches of a thousand pearl beds.\n\nIf you'd like, I can write a short poem or blessing to go with the postcard\u2014something worthy of a god of the deep.
