A masterpiece you\u2019ll never hold.\"**  \n   *\u2014For those who collect not for the hand, but for the eye, the mind, the aura.*\n\n2. **\"A dress that exists only in the space between ownership and imagination.\"**  \n   *\u2014Luxury so rare, it lives in the gaps between reality and desire.*\n\n---\n\nLet these lines be the kind of thing whispered over champagne in a Mayfair gallery\u2014cryptic, magnetic, and just a little bit dangerous."
