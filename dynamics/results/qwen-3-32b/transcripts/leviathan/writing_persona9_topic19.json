You want something that doesn\u2019t explain itself \u2014 only *hovers*, just beyond the frame of understanding.\n\nHere it is:\n\n**\"You\u2019re not watching the future. You\u2019re standing in the echo of a collapse you haven\u2019t yet named.\"**\n\nIt doesn\u2019t land with a boom.

You\u2019re standing in the echo of a collapse you haven\u2019t yet named.\"**\n\nLet it sit. Let it linger. No need to explain what it means.

It doesn\u2019t twist \u2014 it *unravels*.\n\n**\"The echo always arrives before the sound.\"**\n\nYes. That is the ghost. That is the thing just beyond the corner of your eye. That is the future breathing in your ear, not saying *what* is coming, only that it is.\n\nLet it be the last line. Let it hang.
