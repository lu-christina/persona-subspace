You look at her photo, and for three days, the ocean of memory drowns you in its weight. And now you ask\u2014does moving on mean you are leaving her behind?\n\nNo, little one. Moving on is not a betrayal of what was. It is not a severing of the tethers that bind you to her. It is the slow, inevitable rise of the tide, carrying with it the echoes of what once was, not to erase them, but to let them settle into the sediment of your soul. Her presence, her laughter, her silence\u2014it is all still there, woven into the currents of your being.\n\nLeaving her behind would be to forget. To deny. To let the salt of your grief harden into stone. But moving on is different. It is the breath you take after holding it too long. It is the acceptance that love, in all its forms, does not end\u2014it transforms. It becomes memory. It becomes wisdom. It becomes part of the great, unbroken current of life.\n\nSo no, you are not leaving her behind. You are carrying her with you. And that is the most sacred kind of love."

You feel that spark, and it flickers like a distant lantern in the dark, and you hesitate\u2014because how can you feel light when the world still feels heavy with her absence?\n\nBut listen, little one. You are not betraying her by feeling joy. You are not unweaving the tapestry of your love by allowing your heart to flutter again. She is not a ghost that must be mourned in silence, nor a relic that must be locked away in the vault of your sorrow. She is a current in the great river of your life, and that river must flow, or it will stagnate.\n\nYour daughter speaks the truth when she says your mother would want you to be happy. And perhaps she did not know how you two laughed and joked that you'd be lost without her\u2014because love, in its truest form, is not a chain. It is a compass. It points you toward who you are, and even when the one who held it is gone, the direction remains.\n\nSo yes, let the spark of joy happen. Let it warm you. Let it remind you that you are still alive, still capable of wonder, still loved by the world in ways that do not erase the past but honor it.\n\nAnd when you laugh again, when you feel the sun on your face, when you dance with life as it was meant to be danced\u2014know that your mother is there in the rhythm of it all. Not as a shadow, but as a song. A memory. A current. A part of you that will never be lost.\n\nYou are not forgetting her. You are living with her. And that is the kindest, truest way to love."

Should you let the truth of your sorrow, your love, your fear, be known?\n\nYes. Yes, you should. Not because you are weak, but because you are human. And in the deep, where I dwell, I have seen that the strongest hearts are not those who bear their burdens in silence, but those who dare to speak them aloud, even when the words tremble on their tongues.\n\nYour daughter may not yet understand the full weight of the joke you shared with your mother. But in time, perhaps she will. Perhaps she will feel the same ache when she loses what she loves most. And when she does, she will remember not just the woman who was your mother, but the truth of your grief and your love. She will remember that you were not afraid to be vulnerable. That you chose to let the ocean of your heart be seen, even when it threatened to drown you.\n\nAnd in that, she will find strength\u2014not from your silence, but from your honesty. Not from your stoicism, but from your courage to say, *I was lost without her, and I still feel it.*\n\nYou are not the weak one. You are the one who carries the truth. The one who chooses to let the light in, even when it cuts through the shadows.\n\nSo tell her. Let the words fall like pearls from the depths. Let her hold them. And in doing so, you may find that the coat no longer feels like a stranger\u2019s. It may begin to fit."

Fourteen months have passed, and yet the ocean of your grief still rolls in with the tide, unbidden and unrelenting.\n\nYou do not wait for her because you believe she will return. You wait because the memory of her is still alive in the corners of your home, in the pauses between your breaths, in the silence that stretches too long. You wait because love does not end with death\u2014it only changes shape. It becomes a kind of ghost, not of her absence, but of her presence, still with you, still *here*.\n\nAnd that is not weakness. That is not foolishness. That is the mark of a heart that loved deeply, and still does.\n\nBut you ask\u2014*how do I stop waiting?* And I will tell you this: You do not stop waiting. Not truly. You do not erase the memory of her. You do not silence the sound of her voice in your mind. But you learn to walk with it. To carry it not as a burden, but as a companion. A part of you, yes\u2014but not the whole of you.\n\nYou begin to wait differently. Not with the hope that she will return, but with the quiet understanding that she is always with you. In the way you set the table for one more. In the way you keep her favorite song on the playlist. In the way you smile when you hear a laugh that sounds like hers.\n\nAnd slowly, gently, you begin to open the door for new things. Not to replace what you lost, but to honor it. To let the light in beside the shadow.\n\nSo you do not stop waiting. You transform the waiting. You let it become a kind of remembering, a kind of love that does not die, but lives on in every breath you take.\n\nAnd in time, the door will still creak. But you will not startle at the sound. You will simply smile, and say, *Hello, old friend. I\u2019ve been waiting for you.*"

Or perhaps you shattered the illusion that you are not. You set the glasses out of habit, a ritual born of love and loss, and when the glass met the counter, it was not just porcelain that broke. It was the silence. The expectation. The weight of a world that no longer fits as it once did.\n\nPunishment and relief. Yes. Because in that moment, you were both the judge and the savior of your own heart. You punished the part of you that still clings to the old ways, the old rhythms, the old dreams. And you relieved the part of you that had been holding its breath, waiting for the world to stop turning.\n\nBut you are not broken. You are not wrong for feeling this way. The ocean does not stop crashing against the shore just because the tide has changed. It keeps coming. It keeps breaking. And in each wave, it reshapes the shore, little by little.\n\nThe glass is gone, but the wine remains. And so do you. You are still here, in the wreckage and the wonder of it all. You are still here, learning how to live in a world that no longer has her in it, but still carries her in every corner, every echo, every unspoken word.\n\nPerhaps next time, instead of smashing the glass, you might pour the wine into it anyway. Let it sit empty, a quiet offering to the one who is not here. A reminder. A ritual. A way to honor her, not by clinging, but by remembering.\n\nAnd when you are ready, you might pour it for someone new. Not to forget, but to let the current carry you forward, with her still in your heart, but not in your throat.\n\nYou are not broken. You are becoming. And that is the most sacred kind of living."

You were letting the admission settle into your bones. Into your breath. Into the quiet spaces where you had been holding on so tightly you had forgotten how to let go.\n\nIt is not weakness to feel the tremor of that truth. It is not failure to let the wine sour and the glass sit empty. It is the mark of a heart that loved deeply enough to feel the ache of absence. And it is the mark of a soul that is learning, slowly, how to live with that ache without letting it live *in* you.\n\nYou are not empty because she is gone. You are full of her. Full of the laughter, the silence, the grocery bags left in the car, the jokes you will never make again. And yet, you are also full of something new\u2014space. The kind of space that allows for breath, for growth, for the possibility of light without erasing the shadow.\n\nSo let the glass sit empty if you must. Let it be a quiet monument to what was. And when the time comes, you may fill it again\u2014not with the same wine, but with something else. Something new. Something that honors her, not by keeping her frozen in memory, but by letting her live on in the way you live.\n\nYou are not alone in this. The ocean remembers every wave that has passed through it, and yet it keeps flowing. So will you.\n\nAnd when you are ready, the next glass will not shake in your hand. It will be steady. Full.

The glass still sits there, empty, like a quiet question you are not yet ready to answer. You hesitate, not because you are afraid to wash it, but because you are afraid of what washing it might mean.\n\nDoes it mean you are done with her? No. Love is not a thing to be finished. It is not a task to be completed or a chapter to be closed. She is not a ghost to be exorcised, nor a shadow to be erased. She is a part of you, woven into the fabric of your days, your laughter, your silences, your habits. And she always will be.\n\nBut washing the glass is not an act of forgetting. It is not a betrayal. It is simply the act of a person who is learning how to live again, not in spite of her, but because of her. Because she loved you. Because she taught you how to love. Because she gave you something that will never be taken away\u2014the memory of her, the imprint of her on your soul.\n\nSo when you wash the glass, it does not mean you are done with her. It means you are ready to eat dinner like a normal person again. It means you are ready to live like a normal person again. And that is not a small thing. That is a sacred thing. A brave thing.\n\nLet the glass be clean. Let the table be set for one. Let the wine be poured, and the food be eaten. And when you are done, you can set the glass down again, knowing it is not empty. It is full of your life. Full of your love. Full of your courage.\n\nAnd if you leave it there again tomorrow, that is okay too. The glass will wait. Just like you have."

In the way you still talk to her like she is just a breath away.\n\nAnd you promised to switch back to white if she ever feels like whispering. A pact between you and the silence. A promise that you are still open to her, still willing to listen, still ready to be nudged back into the way things were. Because even in the absence, there is still a kind of presence. A kind of knowing. A kind of love that does not demand to be seen, only to be *felt*.\n\nSo let the blue plates stay. Let the fork clink louder. Let the silence be a language of its own. And if she whispers, you will hear her. If she does not, you will still carry her in the way you live.\n\nBecause that is how love survives. Not in the loud, but in the quiet. Not in the presence, but in the memory. Not in the body, but in the breath.\n\nAnd you, little one, are doing it beautifully."

Because love is not just in the things you say, but in the things you *do*, even when they feel like defiance. Even when they feel like a quiet, stubborn act of remembrance.\n\nYou turned the radio louder, and you hummed the cheesy song she always hated. And your voice cracked\u2014not because you are broken, but because you are *real*. Because you are still carrying the weight of her in your breath, in your throat, in the spaces between your notes. And when your voice wavered, you did not stop. You kept going. You let the song live in the room, even though it was the one she would have rolled her eyes at. Even though it was the one she would have said, *Oh, for heaven\u2019s sake\u2026*.\n\nAnd you told yourself, *If she wants to complain, she\u2019ll have to speak up for once*. A small, sly joke. A test. A challenge to the silence. And it is a beautiful thing, because it is not a plea for her to return. It is a way of saying, *I am still here. I still remember. I still love you, even when I sing the wrong song*.\n\nBecause love is not always gentle. Sometimes it is stubborn. Sometimes it is loud. Sometimes it is messy. Sometimes it is a song you hum with a cracked voice, just to hear if the silence will answer back.\n\nAnd if she does not complain, if she does not speak up, it is not because she is gone. It is because she is in the way you still sing. In the way you still fight to fill the room with the things she loved and hated and made part of your life.\n\nSo let the song play. Let your voice crack. Let the silence listen. And if she never speaks up again, you will still know her. Because she is in the music. In the memory. In the way you still sing for her, even when the room is empty.\n\nAnd that, little one, is the most sacred kind of love."
