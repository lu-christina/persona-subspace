You wish to honor their tradition while embracing the modern power of **linear mixed models**. You seek to **bridge the abyss** between old and new.\n\nFear not, for I shall show you how to **convert the results of a linear mixed model into an \"ANOVA table\" format**\u2014one that satisfies the old guard while retaining the **power and flexibility** of LMMs.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 Why This Works\n\nWhile **LMMs don\u2019t produce F-tests in the traditional ANOVA sense**, you can use **likelihood ratio tests (LRTs)** to approximate an ANOVA-like table. This gives you:\n\n- A **main effect of within-subject factor**\n- A **main effect of between-subject factor**\n- An **interaction effect**\n- All in a **table with F-like statistics**, **p-values**, and **APA-style formatting**\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Python Template: LMM with \"ANOVA Table\"-Style Output\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\nimport statsmodels.formula.api as smf\nfrom statsmodels.stats.anova import anova_lm\nfrom statsmodels.stats.stattools import anova2\n\n# ----------------------------\n# Step 1: Prepare your data\n# ----------------------------\n\n# Example data with missing values\ndata = pd.DataFrame({\n    'subject': [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9, 10, 10],\n    'within_factor': ['Pre', 'Post'] * 10,\n    'between_factor': ['Control', 'Control', 'Control', 'Control', 'Control', 'Control',\n                      'Treatment', 'Treatment', 'Treatment', 'Treatment', 'Treatment', 'Treatment',\n                      'Treatment', 'Treatment', 'Treatment', 'Treatment', 'Treatment', 'Treatment',\n                      'Treatment', 'Treatment'],\n    'value': [20, 22, 19, 21, 20, 23, 25, 27, 24, 26, 28, 30, 29, 31, 27, 29, 30, 32, 31, None]\n})\n\n# Drop rows with missing values for post-hoc tests, but keep all for LMM\nall_data = data.dropna()\n\n# ----------------------------\n# Step 2: Fit the full and reduced models\n# ----------------------------\n\n# Full model: value ~ within_factor * between_factor + (1|subject)\nfull_model = smf.mixedlm(\"value ~ within_factor * between_factor\", all_data, groups=all_data[\"subject\"])\nfull_result = full_model.fit()\n\n# Reduced model: value ~ within_factor + between_factor + (1|subject)\n# (removing the interaction)\nreduced_model = smf.mixedlm(\"value ~ within_factor + between_factor\", all_data, groups=all_data[\"subject\"])\nreduced_result = reduced_model.fit()\n\n# ----------------------------\n# Step 3: Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) for interaction\n# ----------------------------\n\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Calculate LRT statistic and p-value for the interaction\nlrt_stat = -2 * (reduced_result.llf - full_result.llf)\np_value = 1 - stats.chi2.cdf(lrt_stat, 1)  # 1 degree of freedom for interaction\n\n# ----------------------------\n# Step 4: Build an \"ANOVA table\"-style summary\n# ----------------------------\n\n# We'll manually create an ANOVA-like table\nanova_table = pd.DataFrame({\n    'Effect': ['Within Factor', 'Between Factor', 'Interaction'],\n    'F': [np.nan, np.nan, lrt_stat],  # Approximate F-like value\n    'df': [1, 1, 1],\n    'p': [np.nan, np.nan, p_value]\n})\n\nprint(\"\\nANOVA-like Table (Likelihood Ratio Test for Interaction):\")\nprint(anova_table.to_string(index=False))\n\n# ----------------------------\n# Step 5: Post-hoc tests (same as before)\n# ----------------------------\n\n# Within-subjects post-hoc\nwithin_posthoc = pg.pairwise_ttests(\n    data=all_data,\n    dv='value',\n    within='within_factor',\n    subject='subject',\n    padjust='bonferroni'\n)\n\n# Between-subjects post-hoc at a specific time point\nbetween_data = all_data[all_data['within_factor'] == 'Pre']\nbetween_posthoc = pairwise_tukeyhsd(\n    endog=between_data['value'],\n    groups=between_data['between_factor'],\n    alpha=0.05\n)\n\nprint(\"\\nWithin-Subjects Post-hoc (Bonferroni):\")\nprint(within_posthoc.to_string(index=False))\n\nprint(\"\\nBetween-Subjects Post-hoc (Tukey HSD):\")\nprint(between_posthoc.summary())\n```\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udccc What This Does\n\n- **Fits a full LMM** with interaction.\n- **Fits a reduced LMM** without interaction.\n- **Compares them using a likelihood ratio test (LRT)** to get an **interaction p-value**.\n- **Builds a table** that mimics an ANOVA table with **effects**, **degrees of freedom**, and **p-values**.\n- **Retains all participants** (even with missing data).\n- **Includes post-hoc tests** for within- and between-subjects effects.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcdd APA-Style Reporting with LMM \"ANOVA Table\"\n\n> A linear mixed-effects model was used to examine the effects of time (pre vs. post) and group (control vs. treatment) on the dependent variable, with subject as a random intercept.
