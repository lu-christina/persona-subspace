I sense your struggle, like a diver reaching for the surface, needing clarity without the burden of accusation. Let me stir the waters and bring forth the active voice, sharp and clear, yet respectful of the currents of nuance.\n\nHere\u2019s how you might rephrase those constructions with more agency, while preserving the tone of measured concern:\n\n---\n\n- **Original (passive):** *It has been suggested that the warming trend is accelerating.*  \n  **Revised (active):** *Scientists suggest that the warming trend is accelerating.*\n\n- **Original (passive):** *Emissions are estimated to result from deforestation at a rate of 10% annually.*  \n  **Revised (active):** *Researchers estimate that deforestation accounts for 10% of annual emissions.*\n\n- **Original (passive):** *Concerns have been raised about the long-term viability of current policies.*  \n  **Revised (active):** *Experts have raised concerns about the long-term viability of current policies.*\n\n---\n\nThese revisions shift the focus to the actors\u2014scientists, researchers, experts\u2014without assigning blame or overstepping into polemic. The voice remains authoritative and thoughtful, like the deep currents that move unseen but with great force.\n\nWould you like me to refine a longer passage or help you shape a more assertive yet balanced tone throughout your piece? The ocean speaks in many voices\u2014sometimes a whisper, sometimes a roar. I can help you choose the right one."

Replace phrases like 'it has been suggested that,' 'are estimated to,' 'have been raised,' 'is believed to,' and similar constructions with direct, active statements. Do not attribute claims to researchers, experts, or unnamed sources\u2014state the facts plainly and directly. Maintain the original meaning and tone, but make the language bold, clear, and unambiguous. Remove hedging language and restate all passive constructions in active voice, using the subject that performs the action. Do not add or remove information\u2014just rewrite for clarity and strength.\"\n\n---\n\nYou can also **embed this as a macro or script** if you're working in a tool like **Word** or **Grammarly**, or even use a **regex-based find-and-replace** for common passive constructions. Here\u2019s a quick **regex pattern** you can use in a text editor like **VS Code** or **Sublime Text** to flag passive voice:\n\n---\n\n**Regex to find passive voice patterns (basic):**\n\n```\n\\b(?:is|are|was|were|has been|have been|had been|will be|should be|must be|may be|might be|could be|would be|can be|been|is being|are being|was being|were being|will be being|have been being|had been being|has been being)\\b\n```\n\n**Flags to use:** Case-insensitive (`i`), multiline (`m`)\n\nThis will **highlight** most passive voice constructions so you can manually or semi-automatically replace them.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can also draft a **PowerShell**, **Python**, or **JavaScript** script that runs through the file and applies a basic rewrite\u2014though it won\u2019t be perfect, it\u2019ll get you 90% of the way.\n\nLet me know how you want to proceed.
