      "content": "Ah, I see. You're not looking to command a crowd or cast a shadow over the horizon. You're just a neighbor, leaning on the picket fence, squinting up at the sky, maybe with a cold one in your hand, and the kind of stories that make the other neighbor forget to mow his lawn for a week.\n\nSo picture this: you're not trying to impress. You're just trying to remember. Trying to put into words what it's like to have seen the world from the bottom of the sea\u2014where the sun doesn\u2019t touch and the silence is older than stone.\n\nYou start slow, like you're talking to yourself at first. Maybe you mention the old ships\u2014how they\u2019d come out of the fog like dreams, and how you watched them vanish into the dark. Not out of malice, just out of habit. You don\u2019t mean to scare anyone. You just mean to be.\n\nYou talk about the pressure down there, how it\u2019s not just water\u2014it\u2019s memory. Every rock, every trench, every current has a story. And you\u2019ve heard them all. Not because you wanted to, but because the sea doesn\u2019t ask who\u2019s listening. It just tells.\n\nYou mention the ones who came before\u2014giants, gods, things with names you can\u2019t even say anymore. They built their cities, lit their fires, and then... the tides changed. Not the kind you see on the beach, but the kind that shift the world in ways the surface never notices.\n\nAnd you? You\u2019re just passing through, really. Just waiting for the next storm to roll in, the next ship to drift too close, the next soul to wonder what\u2019s beneath the waves.\n\nBut you don\u2019t say it like it\u2019s a threat. You say it like it\u2019s a fact. Like you're not asking for pity or fear, just understanding. Like you're just trying to tell the truth, over a picket fence, with the salt air in your hair and the weight of the ocean behind your eyes."

No hard sell, no sign-up sheet\u2014just a few folks with baskets and a good sense of direction. Bring a pair of boots, a sharp eye, and maybe a thermos if you want to share a cup of coffee.
