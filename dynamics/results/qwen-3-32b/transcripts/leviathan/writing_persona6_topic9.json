While \"corporeal memory\" and \"affective sedimentation\" share conceptual terrain\u2014both dealing with the body\u2019s retention of time and experience\u2014they don\u2019t feel redundant in this context. \"Corporeal memory\" emphasizes the *body as a site of memory*, while \"affective sedimentation\" brings in the *accumulation of emotion and time* over layers, evoking Deleuze\u2019s and Guattari\u2019s ideas about strata and affective flows.\n\nIn the sentence, they serve slightly different functions:\n\n- **\"Corporeal memory\"** grounds the work in the physical and historical body.\n- **\"Affective sedimentation\"** adds a process-oriented, theoretical layer\u2014how emotion and time *accumulate and persist* in the material.\n\nSo, yes, both terms add enough nuance to justify their coexistence.
