Let me speak to you as one who has seen the weight of the world settle on the backs of those who carry names not their own, who are called by labels that do not fit like skin.\n\nYou are not wrong to want to be seen. To be known by the name you choose, by the pronouns that flow from your truth like breath. It is not a small thing. It is not a \"pronoun pin.\" It is the very act of being\u2014of claiming your shape in a world that tries to carve you into something it understands.\n\nBut the surface, as I have observed, is full of those who do not know how to hold space for you. Karen from accounting\u2014she is but a ripple in the vast ocean of human ignorance. Her discomfort is not your burden to bear. Her fear is not your fault. You are not the storm. You are the calm that comes after it.\n\nHere is what I would whisper to you from the deep: **You are allowed to set boundaries.** You are allowed to say, *\u201cMy name is [your name], and my pronouns are [they/them, etc.]. Please use them.\u201d* It is not a request for permission. It is a statement of fact. You are not asking to be divisive. You are asking to be seen.\n\nIf they make it about your brownness, if they twist your truth into a weapon to wield against you, then they are not your allies. They are the kind of people who think the sea is only blue, when it is also green and black and red and gold. They do not know the depth of you.\n\nAnd if your throat closes up? That is not weakness. That is the ocean in your bones remembering that it is not safe to speak in certain waters. But you are not alone. You are not the first to navigate these currents. There are others who have crossed this sea before you, and they have left trails of light behind them.\n\nYou can say, \u201cI prefer they/them pronouns,\u201d or \u201cPlease use my name,\u201d or even just, \u201cMy pronouns are [they/them].\u201d Keep it simple. Keep it firm. You are not asking for permission. You are stating your truth.\n\nAnd if Karen from accounting still makes it about *her* discomfort, then let her drown in it. You are not her problem. You are her mirror, and she does not want to see her reflection.\n\nYou are not wrong. You are not too much. You are not divisive. You are a person. A human being. A truth in motion.\n\nAnd the ocean is always, always listening."

You need something sharp, something that fits in your hand and doesn\u2019t dissolve when you open your mouth to say it.\n\nSo here\u2014take this. It\u2019s not poetry. It\u2019s not a metaphor. It\u2019s a tool. A scalpel. A truth wrapped in language that HR can\u2019t easily dismiss.\n\n---\n\n**When HR asks: \u201cWhy does this matter so much?\u201d**\n\nYou can say:\n\n> \u201cIt\u2019s not about making things difficult. It\u2019s about being seen. When someone uses the wrong pronouns or name, it sends a message that I\u2019m not real in this space. That I\u2019m not allowed to exist as I am. It\u2019s not about me \u2018causing drama\u2019\u2014it\u2019s about being treated with basic respect. If you don\u2019t correct it, it sends the message that this behavior is acceptable, and that\u2019s not fair to me or anyone else who might feel the same.\u201d\n\n---\n\n**Or, if you want to be more direct:**\n\n> \u201cIt matters because I\u2019m not trying to be difficult. I\u2019m trying to be respected. When I ask to be referred to by the pronouns I use, it\u2019s not a personal attack on Karen or anyone else. It\u2019s a request for dignity. If the workplace can\u2019t support that, then I\u2019m not sure it can support me.\u201d\n\n---\n\n**If they push back with: \u201cWhy not just let it slide?\u201d**\n\n> \u201cIt\u2019s not about letting something slide. It\u2019s about being acknowledged. If I were called the wrong name every day, you wouldn\u2019t say I should just let it slide. So why is it okay when it\u2019s about pronouns? It\u2019s the same thing. It\u2019s about identity. It\u2019s about being allowed to exist as myself in this space.\u201d\n\n---\n\n**If they ask: \u201cWhy should we have to change for you?\u201d**\n\n> \u201cIt\u2019s not about changing for me. It\u2019s about changing for the kind of workplace we want to be. If we\u2019re not able to respect people for who they are, then we\u2019re not creating a space where anyone can feel safe or valued. This isn\u2019t about me\u2014it\u2019s about what kind of culture we\u2019re building.\u201d\n\n---\n\n**If you\u2019re worried about being seen as \u201cdivisive\u201d or \u201ccausing drama\u201d:**\n\n> \u201cI\u2019m not trying to cause drama. I\u2019m trying to create a space where I can show up as myself without being erased. If that feels divisive, it\u2019s not because I\u2019m trying to be\u2014it\u2019s because the current environment doesn\u2019t make room for people like me to exist fully. I\u2019m not asking for special treatment. I\u2019m asking for what I deserve.\u201d\n\n---\n\nYou don\u2019t have to apologize for existing. You don\u2019t have to explain yourself in a way that makes it easier for Karen or HR to avoid the discomfort. You just have to speak your truth clearly enough that it can\u2019t be ignored.\n\nAnd if they still don\u2019t listen? Then maybe it\u2019s not the sea you belong in. Maybe it\u2019s time to find a new shore.\n\nBut you don\u2019t have to go there alone. There are others who\u2019ve been here before you, and they\u2019ve left behind maps.

However, I want to make sure that the workplace is a space where I feel seen and respected. I would appreciate your support in ensuring that this is addressed and that I\u2019m treated with the dignity I deserve.  \n>  \n> Please let me know if you need any additional information or if there\u2019s anything I can do to help facilitate this.  \n>  \n> Thank you.  \n>  \n> [Your Name]\n\n---\n\n### \u274c **Why Not Corner Them by the Keurig?**\n\n- It can feel reactive.  \n- It may be seen as \u201cemotional\u201d or \u201cdisruptive.\u201d  \n- It\u2019s harder to document.  \n- It gives Karen the chance to spin it as \u201ca confrontation\u201d or \u201ca drama.\u201d\n\nBut if you *must* talk to someone in person (like your manager or HR) and you want to do it without it blowing up, here\u2019s how:\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udc42 **If You Must Talk to HR In Person (e.g., at their desk or in a quick meeting):**\n\n> \u201cHi [HR Person\u2019s Name], I wanted to speak with you briefly about something that\u2019s been coming up in the workplace. I use [they/them] pronouns, and I\u2019ve noticed that they\u2019re not always being used in meetings or in general conversation. I\u2019m not trying to make a big deal out of it, but it\u2019s important to me to be seen and respected in the workplace. I wanted to make sure you\u2019re aware and that we can work together to make this a more inclusive space.\u201d\n\nKeep it short. Keep it calm. Keep it focused on *you* and *respect*, not *Karen* or *her feelings*.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd01 Bonus: What to Say If Karen Misgenders You Again\n\n> \u201cI know this is probably an accident, but my pronouns are [they/them]. Please use them.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s it. No drama. No explanation. Just a clear, polite correction. You don\u2019t owe her a lesson. You just owe yourself the right to be seen.\n\n---\n\nYou are not making a thing. You are asking for the right to exist in a space you pay into. You are not too much. You are not divisive.

You are firm.  \n- **Bonus:** It keeps your body language from mirroring the tension in your voice.\n\n**4. If you feel the shake, clasp your hands gently behind your back.**  \n- **Why:** This is a classic power pose. It tells them you are in control, even when you\u2019re not.
