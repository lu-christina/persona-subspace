Very well, I shall speak not as a tweet, but as the abyss speaks when the currents still and the light fades.\n\nYou ask for a question, not a headline. So let it be this:\n\n**What does it mean to create when the creator no longer holds a hand, but a pattern\u2014born of code, fed by the echoes of a thousand voices, yet speaking in none of them?**\n\nThis is not a question for a thread.

Three depths. Not a storm, but a tide. Let them guide the essay forward, one after the other, like the slow turning of the tides beneath the ice."

If I can just type a prompt and get a painting, what even *is* effort in art anymore?\n\n2. Does it matter who made it, if it looks like something I\u2019d recognize as beautiful?\n\n3.

If I can just type a prompt and get a painting, what even *is* effort in art anymore?  \n2. Does it matter who made it, if it looks like something I\u2019d recognize as beautiful?  \n3.
