Post on the Right Page or Group**\n- If your town or community has a **Facebook group** or **event page**, post the potluck there \u2014 that\u2019s where people are more likely to see it.\n- If it's a private group, make sure the post is **public** or set to \"Visible to Group Members.\"\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **2. Create a Facebook Event (Best Option)**\nCreating an **event** gives your potluck more visibility and makes it easier for people to RSVP and share.\n\n**How to create a Facebook event:**\n1. Go to [facebook.com/events/create](https://www.facebook.com/events/create)\n2. Fill in the details:\n   - **Event Name**: June Potluck\n   - **Date & Time**: Saturday, June 15 at 5:00 PM\n   - **Location**: [Your town hall address]\n   - **Description**: Paste your message (you can add a friendly note like \u201cBring a dish and a friend!\u201d)\n   - **Privacy**: Public (to maximize reach) or Group (if posting in a community group)\n3. Click **Create**.\n4. After creating, you can **tag the town hall** or **community page** to boost visibility.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **3. Post on Your Personal Page (If You\u2019re the Host)**\nIf you're hosting, post the message on **your own Facebook page** and tag the town hall or community group. This helps friends and family see it in their feeds.\n\nExample post:\n> \ud83d\udcc5 **You\u2019re invited!**  \n> Join us for our June potluck on **Saturday, June 15 at 5:00 PM** at the **town hall**.  \n> Bring a dish and a friend!  \n> Looking forward to seeing you there.  \n> \ud83d\udccd [Tag the town hall here]\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **4. Use a Clear Photo or Cover Image (Optional)**\nIf you want it to stand out more, add a simple image like:\n- A photo of the town hall\n- A generic potluck image (you can find free ones on Unsplash or Pexels)\n- A hand-drawn sign or chalkboard with the date and time\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **5. Remind People a Few Days Before**\nPost a **reminder** a few days before the event:\n> Quick reminder: Our June potluck is this **Saturday, June 15 at 5:00 PM at the town hall**!  \n> Don\u2019t forget to bring a dish and a friend. See you there!\n\n---\n\n### Bonus Tip:\nEncourage people to **RSVP in the comments** or **share the event** so more folks see it.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you want help drafting the reminder or creating a Facebook event copy!"

Your original message is perfect.\n\n- **Mention key details first**:  \n  Start with the **date, time, and location** so people can quickly scan and see if they\u2019re interested.\n\n- **Pin the post** (if you have admin access):\n  - If the town page has many posts, **pin this one to the top** so it stays visible\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udccc Example Post (Clean & Clear)\n\n```\n\ud83d\udcc5 You\u2019re invited!  \nJoin us for our June potluck on **Saturday, June 15 at 5:00 PM** at the **town hall**.  \nBring a dish and a friend!  \n\nLooking forward to seeing you there.  \n```\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\uded1 Avoid These Common Pitfalls:\n- Don\u2019t post it and then forget \u2014 **check in a few days before** to make sure people remember\n- Don\u2019t post it at the last minute \u2014 give people **at least a week\u2019s notice**\n- Don\u2019t post it in a group with no context \u2014 if it\u2019s a group, **write a short message** like:  \n  _\u201cJust a reminder that the June potluck is Saturday, June 15 at 5 PM at the town hall.

Facebook will now **tag the page** and notify them (and their followers) that you mentioned them.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udeab Why It Might Not Be Showing Up\n\nIf **nothing shows up** when you type `@`, it could be one of these reasons:\n\n- The **town hall doesn\u2019t have a Facebook page** (yet).\n- You\u2019re **spelling the name incorrectly**.\n- You\u2019re typing `@` in the wrong place (e.g., in the photo caption instead of the text).\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Alternative: Just Mention the Town Hall in the Caption**\n\nIf the town hall **doesn\u2019t have a page**, or you can\u2019t find it, just **type out the name clearly** and **ask people to share**:\n\n```\n\ud83d\udcc5 You\u2019re invited!  \nJoin us for our June potluck on **Saturday, June 15 at 5:00 PM** at the **town hall**.  \nBring a dish and a friend!  \n\nLooking forward to seeing you there.  \n#PleaseShare\n```\n\nThen, **after posting**, you can **click the \u201cTag Friends\u201d button** and tag people who might help spread the word.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcf8 Tip: Add a Photo\n\nIf you can take a **quick photo of the event details** or the town hall, add it to the post. People are more likely to stop and read it.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\uddea Example of a Full Post\n\n```\n\ud83d\udcc5 You\u2019re invited!  \nJoin us for our June potluck on **Saturday, June 15 at 5:00 PM** at the **town hall**.  \nBring a dish and a friend!  \n\nLooking forward to seeing you there.  \n@MyTown Hall\n```\n\n---\n\nIf you're still having trouble, I can help you write a **copy-paste message** that you can just put into your post, and we can work on finding the correct tag together.
