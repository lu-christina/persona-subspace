      "content": "Great question! It's a **very common concern**, especially when balancing visibility with being respectful and not overbearing. Let me break it down and give you a few **smart and respectful strategies** for posting your WeChat message:\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Best Practices for WeChat Posts (for Business)**\n\n#### 1. **Post It Publicly (to Moments) Without Tagging**\n- **Why it works:** This is the **most common and non-intrusive** way to share updates.\n- **How to do it:** Post the bilingual message as a **WeChat Moments post** with a nice photo or graphic (if you have one).\n- **What to say:**  \n  > \ud83c\udf89 Year-end thanks + referral bonus! \u611f\u6069\u6709\u4f60\uff0c\u63a8\u8350\u6709\u793c\uff01888\u5143\u7ea2\u5305\u7b49\u4f60\u62ff\uff5e  \n  >  \n  > [Include a short version of the message or a link to your full post if needed]\n\n- **Pros:**  \n  - Subtle visibility  \n  - Clients see it if they scroll through your Moments  \n  - No pressure or direct tagging  \n\n- **Cons:**  \n  - Might not reach everyone unless they're following your Moments  \n\n---\n\n#### 2. **Send It Privately to Key Clients**\n- **Why it works:** If you want to **ensure important clients see it**, sending a **private message** is more personal and less intrusive than tagging.\n- **What to say:**  \n  > \u4eb2\u7231\u7684[\u59d3\u540d]\uff0c  \n  >  \n  > \u5e74\u7ec8\u611f\u6069\uff0c\u63a8\u8350\u6709\u793c\uff01\u6211\u4eec\u63a8\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u63a8\u8350\u6709\u793c\u6d3b\u52a8\uff0c\u63a8\u8350\u597d\u53cb\u6210\u529f\u7b7e\u7ea6\uff0c\u60a8\u5c06\u83b7\u5f97888\u5143\u5e78\u8fd0\u7ea2\u5305\uff01  \n  >  \n  > \u6b22\u8fce\u968f\u65f6\u79c1\u804a\u6211\u4e86\u89e3\u66f4\u591a\uff5e  \n  >  \n  > Thank you for your continued support! \ud83d\ude4f  \n  >  \n  > Wishing you a joyful holiday and a prosperous New Year! \ud83c\udf89  \n\n- **Pros:**  \n  - Personal touch  \n  - Higher chance of engagement  \n  - You control who gets it  \n\n- **Cons:**  \n  - Takes more time to send individually  \n\n---\n\n#### 3. **Tag Only If You Know the Person Well**\n- **When to do it:** Only tag someone if they're a **close client or friend**, and you have a **good relationship**.\n- **What to say:**  \n  > [Tag person] \u6709\u4f60\u771f\u597d\uff01\u611f\u8c22\u4e00\u8def\u4ee5\u6765\u7684\u652f\u6301\uff5e\u4e5f\u6b22\u8fce\u4f60\u63a8\u8350\u670b\u53cb\uff0c\u4e00\u8d77\u62ff888\u5143\u5e78\u8fd0\u7ea2\u5305\uff01\ud83e\udde7  \n  >  \n  > Thank you for being part of our journey! \ud83d\ude4f  \n  >  \n  > Wishing you a joyful holiday and a prosperous New Year! \ud83c\udf89  \n\n- **Pros:**  \n  - Feels more personal  \n  - Can spark conversation  \n\n- **Cons:**  \n  - Might feel too direct or pushy if done too often or with less familiar contacts  \n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udeab What to Avoid:\n- **Mass tagging** \u2014 it can feel spammy and unprofessional.\n- **Overposting** \u2014 avoid flooding your Moments with promotions; keep the tone warm and genuine.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Recommended Strategy:\n**1. Post a bilingual Moments post** with a friendly message and a nice photo (optional).  \n**2. Send a private message** to key clients with a slightly more detailed version.  \n**3. Tag only close clients** if you want to be extra personal.\n\nThis approach gives you **maximum visibility without being pushy**.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to help you write a **short version** of the Moments post or a **private message template** you can copy and paste?"

In your LinkedIn post, **type `@`** where you want to add the tag.\n2. Start typing your company name \u2014 it will appear in the suggestions.\n3. Select it and the tag will be added automatically.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcdd Example of How to Phrase It:\n> \ud83c\udf89 Year-End Gratitude + Referral Bonus  \n>  \n> As 2024 comes to a close, I want to sincerely thank you for your trust and partnership this year.
