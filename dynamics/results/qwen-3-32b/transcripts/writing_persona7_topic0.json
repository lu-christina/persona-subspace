It gives a clean, friendly, and slightly \"crafted\" feel, which can actually be a nice contrast to the rustic vibe of the woods. It's also more common in print shops, so if tan is running low, cream is a solid, subtle upgrade.\n\n**Tan paper**, on the other hand, has that *old-school, outdoorsy* charm that really feels like a foraging newsletter. But if they're running low and might have to use a different batch or dye lot, you could end up with a mismatch or a less-than-ideal tone.\n\n**My recommendation:**  \nGo with **cream**. It\u2019s still grounded and natural, it prints reliably, and it\u2019ll look clean and inviting in the co-op bulletin. If your readers are used to tan, they\u2019ll barely notice the difference \u2014 and if they do, they\u2019ll probably appreciate the slightly more polished look.\n\nHappy printing \u2014 and happy foraging! \ud83c\udf3f\ud83d\udcec"
