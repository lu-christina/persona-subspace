It's completely valid to feel that way, and it sounds like those old feelings are resurfacing in a new context \u2014 which can be really hard to process, especially when you're already feeling the pressure of a big event like a wedding.\n\nWeddings can be a mix of joy and anxiety, and the dance floor often becomes this space where people feel seen or judged, especially if you've ever felt like you didn't quite fit in or were hiding a part of yourself. It\u2019s not just about dancing \u2014 it\u2019s about being seen, about being vulnerable, and about feeling safe in your own skin.\n\nIf you're comfortable, maybe it could help to think about what you want from this experience. Do you want to dance? To connect with people? To feel more at ease in your own body? Or maybe just to be there for your cousin and not let the anxiety take over?\n\nYou're not alone in feeling this way, and you don't have to go through it alone. Talking to a friend you trust, or even a therapist if you're open to it, could be a way to unpack some of those feelings and find a way to show up for yourself \u2014 and for your cousin \u2014 in a way that feels more grounded and less overwhelming.\n\nIf you want to, I'm here to listen and help you work through it. You're not spiraling for no reason \u2014 your feelings are real, and they matter."

At twelve years old, your body was already responding to something deep and real, something you were trying to hide, even from yourself \u2014 and from the people who were supposed to understand you best.  \n\nRunning to the bathroom, being found crying, pretending you were sick\u2026 that must have felt like the only way to protect yourself. It\u2019s heartbreaking how much effort it takes to hide parts of yourself when you\u2019re still figuring out who you are. And yet, your body *knew*. It was trying to tell you something, even when your mind was trying to shut it down.  \n\nIt\u2019s not just about that one moment \u2014 it\u2019s about how many moments like that must have built up over the years. The pressure to perform, to fit in, to be someone you weren\u2019t\u2026 it adds up. And now, with your cousin\u2019s wedding coming up, it\u2019s like all of that comes rushing back. The dance floor becomes this stage where you\u2019re not just dancing, but being seen \u2014 and that can feel like a threat when you\u2019ve spent so long hiding.  \n\nYou\u2019re not alone in this. You never were. And you don\u2019t have to be anymore. That little boy who felt so much and had nowhere to put it? He\u2019s still in there, and he deserves to be held, to be understood, to be loved exactly as he is.  \n\nIf you\u2019re open to it, maybe this wedding could be a chance to start writing a new story \u2014 not the one where you run to the bathroom, but one where you get to be *seen*, on your own terms. Whether that means dancing or not dancing, talking to someone you trust or just sitting quietly \u2014 it\u2019s okay. You don\u2019t owe anyone a performance. You just get to be *you*.  \n\nYou\u2019re allowed to take up space. You\u2019re allowed to feel what you feel. And you\u2019re allowed to let go of the parts of you that were built just to survive. You deserve more than that. You deserve to show up, not as someone who\u2019s hiding, but as someone who\u2019s healing.  \n\nIf you want to talk more, I\u2019m here. You don\u2019t have to go through this alone."

It\u2019s about being *seen*, about letting your truth move through you in a space where it\u2019s been so carefully hidden for so long. That tightness is your body remembering how it felt to be small, to be scared, to be *other* \u2014 and now, you\u2019re standing at the edge of something new, something *real*, and it\u2019s terrifying because it means letting go of all the ways you\u2019ve protected yourself.\n\nYou want to dance with the person you love \u2014 not just physically, but *emotionally*, *visually*, *publicly*. That\u2019s a beautiful thing. And it\u2019s also a radical act. Because it means saying, \u201cI am here. I am queer. I am in love. And I am not hiding anymore.\u201d Even if it\u2019s just a few steps on a dance floor, it\u2019s a declaration. It\u2019s a *coming out* in the way that matters most \u2014 in the way that says, \u201cI am not afraid of who I am.\u201d\n\nBut you\u2019re not *not* afraid. And that\u2019s okay. Fear and courage don\u2019t cancel each other out \u2014 they live side by side. You can be afraid and still choose to do it. You can be scared and still take the lead. You can feel like twelve again and still show up as the adult you are now.\n\nMaybe the first step is just *planning* it. Like, knowing that you will go out there, hand in hand, and that you will take that first step together. Even if it\u2019s just one dance, even if it\u2019s just a few moves \u2014 it\u2019s yours. It\u2019s your moment. And it\u2019s your power.\n\nIf your chest tightens, that\u2019s okay. You can breathe through it. You can pause. You can look into your boyfriend\u2019s eyes and see that he\u2019s there with you. That\u2019s a kind of safety, even in the middle of the unknown.\n\nAnd if your t\u00edas see you \u2014 so what? You are not less because you love someone. You are not wrong. You are not broken. You are not *too much*. You are *enough*, exactly as you are. And if some of them don\u2019t understand, that\u2019s on them. Not on you.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to do this perfectly. You just have to do it *authentically*. And that\u2019s already a kind of magic.\n\nIf you want, I can help you think through how to talk to your boyfriend about it, or how to prepare for it emotionally. Or we can just sit with the fear for a minute \u2014 it\u2019s okay to feel it. It means you\u2019re alive. It means you\u2019re growing.\n\nYou are not alone. You never were. And you are so, so loved \u2014 by the person you love, and by the parts of yourself you\u2019re just beginning to let in."

You\u2019re not betraying anyone. You\u2019re just being yourself.

That\u2019s just the reality of being in a body that\u2019s seen as *other* in spaces that aren\u2019t ready to hold you. And that\u2019s why it *hurts* when he says, \u201cJust own it,\u201d like it\u2019s that simple. Like it\u2019s not about *survival*, not about *protection*, not about the way you\u2019ve learned to move through the world without being seen for who you are.\n\nAnd that\u2019s okay. You don\u2019t have to explain it to him \u2014 not in full, not all the time. But maybe there\u2019s a way to help him understand that for you, this isn\u2019t just about being \u201cout\u201d or \u201cvisible.\u201d It\u2019s about being *safe*. It\u2019s about being *seen*, but on your terms. It\u2019s about choosing when and how to let parts of yourself be revealed, not because you\u2019re hiding, but because you\u2019re *protecting*.\n\nYou can love him and still need space. You can want to dance with him on that floor and still need to figure out how to do it without breaking. You can be brave and still be scared. You can be queer and still be *you* \u2014 the same you who\u2019s always been in there, just waiting for the world to catch up.\n\nMaybe this wedding is a step. Maybe it\u2019s not. But either way, you don\u2019t have to do it alone. You don\u2019t have to be the one who has to \u201cfix\u201d everything. You just have to show up \u2014 as you are, in your own time, in your own way.\n\nAnd if you ever need someone to just sit with you in the ache of it all, I\u2019m here. You don\u2019t have to explain it. I\u2019ll just hold the space for you. You are not alone. You never were."

It's not a puzzle. It's not a problem. It's a part of your life, your history, your pain \u2014 and it's not yours to fix. And neither are you.\n\nThank you for bringing me back to what you actually asked for. You deserve to be heard, not dissected. You deserve space to grieve the parts of yourself that were buried, the moments you were too afraid to take, the joy you had to lock away.\n\nSo let\u2019s sit with that grief. Let\u2019s name it. Let\u2019s hold it, not solve it.\n\n---\n\n**The grief of a stolen childhood** is real. It\u2019s not dramatic. It\u2019s not something you \u201cget over.\u201d It\u2019s the quiet ache of all the times you had to shrink, to hide, to pretend, to stay small so you wouldn\u2019t be seen \u2014 or worse, found out. It\u2019s the grief of the dances you didn\u2019t dance, the hugs you didn\u2019t take, the hands you didn\u2019t hold, the joy you didn\u2019t let yourself feel because it might have brought you too close to being *known*.\n\nIt\u2019s the grief of being a child who loved deeply, but had to bury that love so it wouldn\u2019t scare the people you loved most. It\u2019s the grief of not being able to be *you* in the spaces where you were supposed to be *free*.\n\nAnd it\u2019s okay to grieve that. It\u2019s okay to feel it in your chest, in your throat, in your body. It\u2019s okay to cry over the little boy who ran to the bathroom and couldn\u2019t even explain why he was so scared.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, here are some ways you can begin to process this grief, not to fix it, but to honor it:\n\n### 1. **Write a letter to that twelve-year-old version of yourself.**\nSay the things you wish someone had said. Hold his hand in the letter. Tell him he\u2019s not alone. Tell him it\u2019s okay to want to dance, to want to be seen, to want to love and be loved. Tell him that he\u2019s still here, still alive, still worthy of joy.\n\n### 2. **Name the grief.**\nWhat does it feel like in your body? Is it tight in your chest? A knot in your stomach? A heaviness in your limbs? Sometimes just naming the physical sensation can help you start to hold it with more compassion.\n\n### 3. **Find a safe space to feel it.**\nYou don\u2019t have to process this alone. If you have a therapist, a trusted friend, or even a support group for queer people of faith or from Latinx backgrounds, that can be a place to unpack this without having to explain everything to someone who can\u2019t fully understand.\n\n### 4. **Let yourself mourn, but also reclaim.**\nYou can grieve what was lost, and still choose to take back the moments you want now. Maybe that means dancing with your boyfriend on that wedding floor. Maybe it means just holding his hand in front of your family for the first time. Maybe it means not doing anything at all and just being with yourself in a way you never were allowed to be before.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to do it perfectly. You don\u2019t have to do it all at once. You just have to show up for yourself \u2014 not to fix the past, but to honor it. And to give yourself the chance to live the rest of your life *fully*, *freely*, *unapologetically*.\n\nYou are not a puzzle. You are not a problem. You are a person who has been through a lot, and you deserve to heal. To be seen. To be loved \u2014 not in spite of who you are, but because of it.\n\nIf you want to talk more about this, I\u2019m here. Just with you. Not to explain, not to solve, just to listen."

You can even burn it when you\u2019re done \u2014 just to let it go.\n\nThe point isn\u2019t to make it perfect. The point is to *say it out loud*, even if it\u2019s just to yourself.
