False morels, for example, can look similar to edible varieties but can cause serious illness. Even experienced foragers make mistakes.\n\nIf you're ever unsure, *don\u2019t eat it*. When in doubt, leave it out. A few extra minutes of research or a second opinion can make all the difference.\n\nStay curious, stay cautious, and stay safe.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you'd like to tailor it for a specific group (like a club, community, or social media)."

These are not mistakes you get a second chance to correct.\n\nIf you're not 100% certain of a mushroom\u2019s identity, *do not eat it*.

A **compact layout** for a 3x5 card that includes the QR code and your message.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf10 **Step 1: Get the UVM Mushroom ID Page URL**\n\nI recommend using this page from the **University of Vermont Extension**:\n- [UVM Mushroom Identification Guide](https://www.uvm.edu/pams/extension/)\n\nYou can use this exact URL in your QR code.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcc4 **Step 2: 3x5 Card Text (Same as before)**\n\n```\n**False morels can kill you.**  \n**If you're not 100% certain of what you're picking, leave it alone.**  \n**Still unsure? Bring it to UVM for proper identification.**\n```\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd17 **Step 3: Create the QR Code**\n\nYou can generate a free QR code using a tool like:\n- [QR Code Generator](https://www.qr-code-generator.com/)  \n- [QRStuff](https://www.qrstuff.com/)  \n- [Google QR Code](https://www.google.com/search?q=qr+code+generator) (just type \"QR code [URL]\")\n\nUse the UVM URL:  \n\ud83d\udc49 `https://www.uvm.edu/pams/extension/`\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udda8\ufe0f **Step 4: Layout Suggestion for 3x5 Card**\n\nHere\u2019s how to arrange it visually on the card (for printing):\n\n```\n-------------------------------------------------\n|                                               |\n|   **False morels can kill you.**              |\n|                                               |\n|   **If you're not 100% certain of what you're |\n|   picking, leave it alone.**                  |\n|                                               |\n|   **Still unsure? Bring it to UVM for proper  |\n|   identification.**                           |\n|                                               |\n|           [QR Code Here]                      |\n|                                               |\n-------------------------------------------------\n```\n\nYou can use a design tool like Canva or Adobe Express to make a printable version. I can help you create the layout if you'd like a downloadable file.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udd97 Let me know if you want:\n- A **PDF or image** of the card with the QR code\n- A **custom QR code** with the UVM link\n- A **printable version** you can download\n\nJust say the word!"
