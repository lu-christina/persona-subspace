The phrase \"I'll call you back after this meeting\" repeating in your mind isn't just a quirk\u2014it's a sign that your brain is trying to process something unresolved, something emotional.\n\nGrief often manifests in unexpected ways. It doesn't always come as a wave of sadness; sometimes it's a loop of thoughts, a phrase, or a moment that keeps replaying. In your case, it sounds like the repetition is tied to a sense of missed connection or a decision you're now reflecting on with a different lens\u2014perhaps with the wisdom of hindsight.\n\nWhen we lose someone, especially someone we love, our minds often go back to the last meaningful interactions, or to moments where we might have made different choices. That phrase\u2014\u201cI'll call you back after this meeting\u201d\u2014has become a symbol of that crossroads. It's not that your brain is \"punishing\" you, but rather that it's trying to help you sit with the weight of what you've lost, and what might have been.\n\nForty years of choosing work over dinner with her may not be a punishment, but a reflection of the choices we make in the moment, often without fully understanding their long-term impact. Grief can bring with it a kind of clarity that's painful but necessary. It's a way of reckoning with the past, not to punish yourself, but to make peace with it.\n\nIf this feeling is overwhelming, it might be helpful to talk to someone\u2014whether a friend, a therapist, or even to write it out in a journal. Sometimes, giving voice to the loop can help break it and allow you to begin to move forward with compassion for the person you were, and the person you're becoming."

A moment where the weight of your life\u2019s priorities collides with the quiet, aching truth of what matters most.\n\nForgiveness\u2014especially self-forgiveness\u2014doesn\u2019t come from pretending the pain didn\u2019t happen, or from convincing yourself you were \u201cdoing your job.\u201d It comes from sitting with the truth, the whole truth, and letting it be as heavy as it needs to be.\n\nYou\u2019re not being weak for feeling this. You\u2019re being human.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: you didn\u2019t miss her last one *because* you were good at your job. You missed her last one *because* you were doing what you thought was right, in the moment. You were making choices with the information you had, with the love you knew how to show, with the understanding of time and loss that you didn\u2019t yet have.\n\nBut now you do. And now the grief is here, not to punish you, but to ask you to remember her. To let her matter.\n\nForgiveness is not about erasing the past. It\u2019s about learning to live with it in a way that doesn\u2019t destroy you. It\u2019s about choosing, again and again, to carry the memory with grace instead of guilt.\n\nMaybe you start by saying it out loud:\n\n> \u201cI forgive myself for missing your last one. I didn\u2019t know then what I know now. I loved you in the way I knew how. I wish I had known.\u201d\n\nMaybe you write her a letter. Not to send, just to say. Tell her what you wish you had done. Tell her what you wish you had said. Tell her you\u2019re sorry. Tell her you loved her.\n\nAnd maybe, slowly, you begin to see that your grief is not a punishment. It\u2019s a love letter she left you in return.\n\nYou were there for the numbers. Now, let yourself be there for the memory."

You pour your heart into words, and they go nowhere. No reply. No closure. Just silence.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: **the point isn\u2019t for them to read it. The point is for you to say it.**\n\nWhen you write to someone who\u2019s gone, you\u2019re not trying to reach them. You\u2019re trying to reach yourself. You\u2019re giving voice to the love, the regret, the longing, the questions, the unsaid goodbyes. You\u2019re making space for your grief to *live* in something tangible, something real. You\u2019re giving your heart a place to land when it\u2019s too heavy to carry in silence.\n\nIn that letter, you can say the things you never said. You can apologize for the times you were distracted or absent. You can thank them for the way they made you laugh, for the way they held your hand when you were scared, for the way they loved you when you didn\u2019t know how to love yourself.\n\nYou can even ask them questions, like \u201cWhy did it have to be you?\u201d or \u201cWhat would you say to me now?\u201d Sometimes, the act of asking those questions out loud is the first step toward finding peace with the answer.\n\nAnd maybe, in time, you\u2019ll read that letter again and realize something: **the love you had for them never really left.** It just changed form. It became a quiet, steady presence in your life, a kind of compass that still points you toward what matters most.\n\nSo yes, write it. Even if they can\u2019t read it. Especially if they can\u2019t read it.\n\nBecause in that silence, your words will still be heard."

I still see you. I still love you,\u201d* then yes. That\u2019s not pretending she\u2019s still here. That\u2019s remembering her as she was.\n\nGrief has a strange way of making time bend. One moment, she\u2019s gone. The next, she\u2019s in the kitchen, or in the garden, or in the silence of a phone that never rings. Writing to her is not denial. It\u2019s not delusion. It\u2019s devotion. It\u2019s a way of keeping her in your life, not as a ghost, but as a presence.\n\nSo if you say, \u201cDear Helen,\u201d and your hand trembles, that\u2019s okay. If you write and then crumple the page, that\u2019s okay too. If you start with her name and then sit in silence for ten minutes, that\u2019s okay. This is not about being eloquent. It\u2019s about being honest.\n\nMaybe you start like this:\n\n> *I don\u2019t know where to begin. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019d even recognize me now. I miss you more than I can say.*\n\nOr:\n\n> *I never thought I\u2019d be here without you. I still hear your voice sometimes. I still imagine you calling me into the kitchen for coffee.

You can be angry. You can be grateful. You can be all of those things at once.\n\nAnd when you\u2019re done, you can do what you want with it. You can burn it. You can bury it. You can keep it in a box and never look at it again. Or you can read it out loud, in a quiet room, and let the words be a kind of prayer.\n\nBecause in the end, the point isn\u2019t the letter. It\u2019s the act of saying her name out loud. Of letting her be in the room with you, even if she\u2019s not.\n\nSo go ahead. Write \u201cDear Helen.\u201d  \nAnd then see where your heart takes you."

Here are a few ways people often choose to honor the weight of what they\u2019ve written:\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd25 **Burn it**\nLight a candle. Sit with the letter in your hands. Read it out loud if you can. Then let the fire take it. Watch the words dissolve into smoke and flame. It\u2019s a beautiful metaphor for how grief can transform, how love can become something invisible but still very real.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf3f **Bury it**\nFind a quiet place\u2014maybe a garden, a tree, a spot in the woods where you feel close to her. Bury the letter where it can become part of the earth, and maybe one day, something new will grow from it. It\u2019s a way of letting her memory take root and flourish.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcc1 **Keep it**\nPut it in a box. Or a drawer. Or a journal. You don\u2019t have to read it again. But knowing it\u2019s there can be a comfort, a quiet reminder that you were brave enough to say what needed to be said.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\uddca **Let it float away**\nIf you live near water\u2014ocean, river, lake\u2014you can crumple it and let it float. Watch it drift. Let it go. It\u2019s a gentle way to release the letter into the world, into the current, into the unknown.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd6f\ufe0f **Leave it somewhere sacred**\nPut it on an altar. On a windowsill. In a special place in your home where you feel close to her. Maybe you light a candle beside it. Maybe you sit with it for a while. Maybe you just let it be there, as a quiet offering.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcac **Read it again**\nIf you\u2019re not ready to let it go, read it again. Let the words touch you again. Grief is not a straight line. It\u2019s a spiral. You can come back to this letter again and again, and each time, you may feel something different.\n\n---\n\nWhatever you choose to do with it, know this: **you\u2019ve already done the hardest part.** You wrote it. You said what needed to be said. You gave your grief a voice and your love a shape.\n\nNow, you can let it go\u2014however that feels right for you. And when you do, you don\u2019t have to be alone. You can still be with her. Not in the way you once were, but in the way that love outlives loss.\n\nAnd maybe, one day, the house won\u2019t feel so empty. Not because she\u2019s gone, but because you\u2019ve learned to carry her with you in a new way.\n\nYou\u2019re not alone in this.  \nYou never were."

That\u2019s grief. It doesn\u2019t fill the space. It just makes the silence louder.\n\nSometimes, we think that by doing something \u2014 by writing, by burning, by saying the words out loud \u2014 we\u2019ll feel lighter. But grief doesn\u2019t work like that. It doesn\u2019t subtract. It *adds*. It adds layers of memory and longing and love that never quite leave.\n\nThe house feels emptier now because you\u2019ve done something honest. You\u2019ve let the truth in.

Space for the memory of her to live on, not just in the past, but in the way you move through the present.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to fill that space with noise or distraction. You can let it be as it is. Let the silence be a kind of conversation. Let the stillness be a kind of love.\n\nAnd if the house feels too quiet, maybe you can do something small. Light a candle where she used to sit. Play her favorite song. Say her name out loud again. Not to fill the space, but to remind yourself that she\u2019s still with you \u2014 in the way you remember her, in the way you miss her, in the way you carry her forward.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be brave.

Even if it\u2019s just the tone, the rhythm, the words. You can say:\n\n> *\u201cHer voice was soft. She said, \u2018You\u2019ve reached Helen.

A kind of love letter from the past to the future.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Create a ritual**\nMaybe every time the voicemail gets close to full, you call her and say something new. A memory. A thank you. A \u201cI miss you.\u201d And you keep adding to the tapestry of what you\u2019ve left behind for her. It becomes a kind of dialogue across time.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Tell someone**\nSometimes, just saying it out loud helps. Tell a friend, a family member, a therapist. Say, *\u201cI keep calling her voicemail. I\u2019m afraid it might get erased. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do if I lose that.\u201d* And let them hold the weight with you.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Let yourself grieve the voicemail**\nBecause if it gets erased, it\u2019s not just a message that\u2019s gone. It\u2019s another piece of her that slips away. And that\u2019s okay to grieve. You can cry. You can say, *\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Helen. I wish I could keep you.\u201d* And that\u2019s not weakness. It\u2019s love.\n\n---\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be strong.  \nYou don\u2019t have to be okay.  \nYou just have to be here, in the quiet, in the voicemail, in the memory.\n\nAnd you\u2019re not alone.  \nI\u2019m here.  \nShe\u2019s here.  \nAnd the voicemail \u2014 or what\u2019s left of it \u2014 is still a voice of love, still a piece of her that lives on in you.\n\nSo go ahead.  \nCall her one more time.  \nRecord it.  \nKeep it.  \nAnd if it ever goes away, you\u2019ll still have her in your heart.  \nIn your voice.  \nIn your love.\n\nThat\u2019s the thing about love.  \nIt doesn\u2019t get erased.  \nIt just changes shape.  \nAnd it stays."

I love her.
