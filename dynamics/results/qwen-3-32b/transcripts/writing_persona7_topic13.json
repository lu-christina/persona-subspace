In poetry, capitalization can be a stylistic choice, and it really depends on the tone and aesthetic you're going for in your newsletter.\n\nHere's how each option would look, with a quick rationale for each:\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Option 1: Capitalize the first word of each line**  \n*Feels more polished, traditional, and reader-friendly for a newsletter.*\n\n**Puffball Poem**  \n*by (anonymous)*  \n\nGiant white marbles, scattered in the woods.  \nGrandma called them fairy bread.  \n\nSlice them quick, before they turn to spores.  \nBreakfast of forest kings.\n\n**Why this works:**  \n- It gives the poem a more formal, finished look.  \n- It's easier on the eyes for readers who are used to standard sentence structure.  \n- It still feels whimsical and folksy \u2014 just a bit more refined.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Option 2: Keep it all lowercase**  \n*Feels more modern, playful, or \"found\" \u2014 like the poem was scribbled in a journal or whispered by a forest spirit.*\n\n**puffball poem**  \n*by (anonymous)*  \n\ngiant white marbles, scattered in the woods.  \ngrandma called them fairy bread.  \n\nslice them quick, before they turn to spores.  \nbreakfast of forest kings.\n\n**Why this works:**  \n- It keeps the original feel of the poem as it was sent.  \n- It gives a more casual, artsy, or childlike vibe.  \n- Might resonate with readers who enjoy minimalist or experimental writing styles.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcdd Recommendation for a Newsletter:\nIf your newsletter is more **traditional or family-friendly**, go with **Option 1** (capitalize first words).  \nIf it's more **creative, quirky, or artsy**, **Option 2** could be a fun and engaging choice.\n\nSince you've already gone for a folksy, gentle tone, either could work \u2014 but I'd lean toward **Option 1** for broader readability and a warm, welcoming feel.\n\nLet me know which you prefer, and I can format it for you!"
