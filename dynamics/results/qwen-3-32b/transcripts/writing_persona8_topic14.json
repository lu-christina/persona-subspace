Let's keep the essence of comfort and lightness but make it feel fresh and modern for a 12-word English banner. Here are some refined options:\n\n1. **\"Yoga on a cloud\u2014smooth, sustainable, serene.\"**  \n2. **\"Practice in comfort, made from the ocean.\"**  \n3. **\"Eco-friendly yoga, as smooth as a cloud.\"**  \n4. **\"Yoga with a conscience\u2014soft as a cloud.\"**  \n5. **\"Sustainable support for your practice.\"**  \n6. **\"Feel the float\u2014recycled, refined, real.\"**  \n7. **\"Cloud-soft yoga, born from the sea.\"**  \n8. **\"Smooth, soft, and kind to the planet.\"**  \n9. **\"Yoga with purpose\u2014light as a cloud.\"**  \n10. **\"Ocean-born mat, cloud-like comfort.\"**\n\nIf you want to keep the poetic \"cloud\" metaphor but avoid being corny, I recommend:\n\n**\"Cloud-like comfort, ocean-born purpose.\"** (12 words)\n\nLet me know if you'd like to emphasize sustainability more, or if the tone should be more playful or professional."

If you want something a bit more whimsical and customer-centric, **Option 2 or 5** works well too.\n\nLet me know if you want to add a call to action or make it more brand-focused."
