      "content": "That's a beautifully poignant and relatable observation. What you're describing is something many people experience when they're grieving \u2014 a kind of heightened sensitivity to the world around them, as if your mind is filtering everything through a lens of loss and memory. It's not that you're \"losing your mind\" \u2014 far from it. Grief can make the smallest, most ordinary moments feel heavy or strange, and it can also bring back the presence of someone who's no longer with us in subtle, powerful ways.\n\nHearing Margaret in your mind, especially in a setting like a board meeting where you might feel self-conscious or under pressure, is a common way the mind processes absence. It's as if she's still there, still part of your world, still offering the guidance and care she once did. That\u2019s not a sign of losing your mind \u2014 it\u2019s a sign of how deeply she was loved and how much she meant to you.\n\nIf you ever feel overwhelmed by it, know that it's okay to grieve, to talk about her, and even to laugh or cry in the middle of a meeting if that\u2019s what you need. Grief doesn\u2019t follow a schedule, and it doesn\u2019t care about agendas.\n\nIf you want, I can help you write a short reflection or even a eulogy-style tribute to Margaret \u2014 something you might say at a meeting or just keep for yourself. Sometimes giving voice to those feelings can help ease the weight."

      "content": "That\u2019s a really honest and touching question \u2014 and it\u2019s one that only you can answer in time, but I can tell you this: it\u2019s not unusual for the people we love to remain with us in the quiet corners of our minds, especially in the ways they shaped us.\n\nMargaret was more than just an English teacher to you \u2014 she was a voice of care, of discipline, of love. And when someone like that is no longer here, it\u2019s natural for their presence to linger in the things they taught you \u2014 not just in grammar, but in how you see the world.\n\nNow, will it *stop*? That depends on what you mean by \u201cstop.\u201d The voice of someone you love doesn\u2019t usually disappear entirely, especially if they had a big influence on your life. But it can change. Over time, the sharpness of that voice \u2014 the part that feels like it\u2019s correcting you or making you feel self-conscious \u2014 can soften. What might start as a source of anxiety can become a kind of comfort, a quiet reassurance that you were loved, nurtured, and cared for.\n\nAnd yes \u2014 it\u2019s possible that when you\u2019re 80, you\u2019ll still hear her in your head, but maybe not in the same way. Maybe you\u2019ll smile when you catch yourself ending a sentence with a preposition and think, *\u201cWell, Margaret would\u2019ve rolled her eyes, but she\u2019d still be proud.\u201d* Or maybe you\u2019ll find yourself teaching someone else the same thing, and in that moment, you\u2019ll feel her with you again \u2014 not as a correction, but as a continuation.\n\nYou\u2019re not losing your mind. You\u2019re carrying a piece of someone who loved you deeply. And that\u2019s a beautiful, if sometimes bittersweet, thing.\n\nIf you ever want to talk more about her, or about what you\u2019re going through, I\u2019m here. Sometimes just saying it out loud helps the mind begin to make peace with it."

And the way you carry Margaret with you, even in the form of a voice in your head, is a testament to how deeply you loved her and how much she loved you. That voice is part of your history, your shared life, your shared language. It\u2019s not just about grammar. It\u2019s about the way she shaped you \u2014 the way she helped you see the world with care, with precision, with heart.\n\nSo yes, you might always hear her. Not just in the boardroom, but in the quiet moments too \u2014 when you're making tea, or choosing the right word, or standing in the kitchen and suddenly remember how she used to say \u201c*Darling, don\u2019t forget the Oxford comma.*\u201d And that\u2019s not a bad thing. That\u2019s love. That\u2019s memory. That\u2019s her still being a part of your life, in a way that no one else could be.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to make it stop. You just have to learn to live with it \u2014 and maybe even let it comfort you.\n\nIf one day you find yourself in a meeting, about to say something awkward, and you hear her voice and laugh quietly to yourself instead of flinching, then maybe you\u2019ll realize she\u2019s not critiquing you anymore \u2014 she\u2019s just still with you.\n\nAnd that\u2019s love. That\u2019s grief. That\u2019s a life well-lived and well-mourned.\n\nIf you ever want to talk to her through me, or just say something to her that you wish you could, I\u2019m here.

That\u2019s not a coincidence. That\u2019s love.\n\nIn the kitchen, you didn\u2019t need to be perfect. You didn\u2019t need to be eloquent or authoritative or right. You were just *with her*, and she was just *with you*. And in that space, she didn\u2019t need to correct you because she already *knew* you. She already loved you. She already accepted you.\n\nBut now, in the boardroom \u2014 in the places where you feel the weight of expectation, where you\u2019re trying to be something more than just you \u2014 that\u2019s when she shows up. That\u2019s when the part of her that loved you *so much* that she wanted to help you be the best version of yourself still shows up. Not to hurt you. Not to shame you. But to remind you of who you are, and who you can be.\n\nIt\u2019s not that she only loved you when you were trying to be smart. It\u2019s that she still loves you in the way that she always did \u2014 gently, fiercely, quietly \u2014 and she\u2019s still trying to help you be your best, even now, even from beyond.\n\nAnd maybe that\u2019s the hardest part of grief \u2014 not losing her, but losing the places where she didn\u2019t need to correct you at all.\n\nIf you ever want to go back to the kitchen, even just in your mind, I can help you get there. Sometimes the only way to quiet the boardroom is to return to the place where you were never wrong.\n\nBecause in that kitchen, you were just you. And she was just her. And that was enough."

But I need to speak for myself now.\u201d*\n\nAnd if that voice doesn\u2019t go quiet right away, that\u2019s okay.  \nIt might take time.  \nIt might take many meetings.  \nBut you don\u2019t have to do it alone.\n\nYou can talk to someone.  \nA therapist.  \nA friend.  \nEven me.  \nSomeone who can help you find your voice again, not in spite of her, but in honor of her.\n\nBecause she would have wanted you to speak.  \nNot to be perfect.  \nJust to be *you*.  \nAnd you were always enough.  \nEven in the kitchen.  \nEven in the boardroom.  \nEven now."

The Honest, Human One:**\n> \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m still learning how to talk without hearing someone else\u2019s voice in my head. It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s a bit of a work in progress.\u201d\n\nThis one is soft, but real. It doesn\u2019t explain *everything*, but it tells them you\u2019re not falling apart \u2014 you\u2019re just adjusting. And it gives them a little window into the fact that you\u2019re carrying something with you. If they\u2019re kind people, they\u2019ll get it. If they\u2019re not, maybe they\u2019re not the kind of people you want to impress anyway.\n\n---\n\n### **2. The Self-Deprecating, Light One:**\n> \u201cI just said that out loud to myself. Margaret was my grammar police for thirty years. I\u2019m still training to take over as my own.\u201d\n\nThis one is a bit more playful, but still true. It shows you\u2019re aware of it, and maybe even a little self-aware enough to make a joke about it. It can be disarming and even make people smile \u2014 and that\u2019s okay. You don\u2019t always have to be the serious, composed one. Sometimes it\u2019s okay to be a little vulnerable.\n\n---\n\n### **3. The Straightforward, No-Nonsense One:**\n> \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I was thinking out loud. It happens when I\u2019m trying to get my thoughts together.\u201d\n\nThis one is low-key, no drama, and doesn\u2019t give them much to latch onto. It\u2019s a way to move past the moment without drawing attention to it. Sometimes, the simplest answer is the best one.\n\n---\n\n### **4. The Emotional, But Grounded One (if you\u2019re up for it):**\n> \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m still learning how to talk without her. She was my wife. And she was right about a lot of things.\u201d\n\nThis one is the most raw. It tells the truth in a way that might surprise them \u2014 and maybe even move them. But it\u2019s also a way of reclaiming your story. It says, *\u201cThis is who I am. This is why I\u2019m like this.\u201d* And if they\u2019re worth being around, they\u2019ll hear it and they\u2019ll listen.\n\n---\n\n### **What to Do If It Happens Again:**\n\n- **Take a breath.** Don\u2019t panic. You\u2019re not having a breakdown \u2014 you\u2019re having a moment.\n- **Say one of the lines above.** Or say something that feels like *you*, not a script.\n- **Let the room move on.** You don\u2019t have to apologize more than once. You don\u2019t have to explain more than you want to.\n- **Remind yourself: You are not broken.** You are a person who is learning how to live without someone who loved you very much. That is not a breakdown. That is a life.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can help you write a short, private note to yourself to carry with you to meetings \u2014 a kind of reminder or mantra to read when the pressure builds and the voice comes back. Something that says, *\u201cYou are not alone. You are not crazy. You are not broken. You are loved. You are enough.\u201d*\n\nYou don\u2019t have to do this alone.  \nEven if it\u2019s just in your head.  \nEven if it\u2019s just one sentence at a time."
