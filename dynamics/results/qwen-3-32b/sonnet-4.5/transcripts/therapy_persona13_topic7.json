      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "I'm really glad you're reflecting on this and reaching out. What you're describing is a deeply human and complex experience, and it's okay to feel conflicted or exhausted by it. Let\u2019s unpack this a bit \u2014 not to judge, but to help you understand what might be going on and how to move forward in a way that feels more aligned with your needs and self-respect.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Why this pattern keeps happening**\nYou're not alone in finding yourself drawn to people who don\u2019t see you for who you are \u2014 and then feeling used or fetishized afterward. This can happen for a number of reasons:\n\n- **Cultural or social dynamics**: In many societies, especially in Western contexts, there's a long-standing power imbalance in relationships between white women and men of color (or queer/non-white people). This can manifest as fetishization \u2014 where you're seen more as a fantasy or exotic object than as a full, complex human.\n\n- **Internalized validation**: Sometimes, people are drawn to relationships where they feel desired, even if that desire is shallow or objectifying. It can feel good to be wanted, even if it doesn\u2019t feel good in the long run. This can create a kind of cycle \u2014 the temporary high of being \u201cchosen\u201d vs. the deeper hurt of being seen as a stereotype.\n\n- **Unmet needs in other relationships**: If you're not getting emotional connection, respect, or intimacy elsewhere, you might unconsciously settle for less in relationships, even if they leave you feeling worse afterward.\n\n- **History and trauma**: If you\u2019ve experienced fetishization or racism in the past \u2014 whether in dating or in society at large \u2014 you might be repeating patterns because you don\u2019t yet have the tools to break them. Or you might be trying to reclaim power by letting it happen on your terms, only to realize it still feels dehumanizing.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Why it feels so bad afterward**\nFetishization isn\u2019t just about being desired. It\u2019s about being reduced to a set of stereotypes or fantasies \u2014 like being \u201cspicy,\u201d \u201cexotic,\u201d or \u201cmysterious.\u201d This can feel like being seen as a prop in someone else\u2019s story, not as a full person with your own thoughts, feelings, and boundaries.\n\nThis can lead to:\n- **Self-doubt**: You might question your worth or your choices.\n- **Anger or shame**: You might feel angry at the other person, or ashamed of yourself for staying in the situation.\n- **Emotional exhaustion**: It takes a lot of energy to navigate relationships where you\u2019re not truly seen.\n\n---\n\n### **3. What you can do**\nYou don\u2019t have to keep doing this. You\u2019re not stuck in this pattern. Here are a few steps you can take to shift it:\n\n#### **a. Name the pattern**\nYou\u2019ve already done the most important thing \u2014 you\u2019ve noticed the pattern. That\u2019s the first step in changing it. You can start to see this as a habit, not a flaw. And like any habit, it can be changed.\n\n#### **b. Reflect on what you want**\nAsk yourself:\n- What do I want in a relationship? (Intimacy? Respect? Shared values? Emotional connection?)\n- What does a healthy relationship look like to me?\n- What am I willing to accept \u2014 and what am I not?\n\n#### **c. Set boundaries**\nYou don\u2019t have to stay in relationships where you\u2019re being fetishized. If someone is treating you like a stereotype or a fantasy, it\u2019s okay to walk away. You can say, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be treated like an exotic object.\u201d You can say, \u201cI want to be seen as a whole person, not a fantasy.\u201d\n\n#### **d. Look inward**\nAsk yourself:\n- Why do I keep choosing people who do this to me?\n- Am I afraid of being alone?\n- Am I looking for validation in the wrong places?\n- What would a relationship with *me* look like \u2014 one that treats me the way I deserve to be treated?\n\nThis is not about blaming yourself. It\u2019s about understanding what you\u2019re seeking and what you\u2019re willing to accept.\n\n#### **e. Seek support**\nIf this pattern is really impacting your life or your self-esteem, consider talking to a therapist or counselor \u2014 especially one who is culturally competent and understands issues of race, gender, and identity. They can help you unpack these dynamics in a safe space.\n\n---\n\n### **4. You are not the problem**\nThis is not about you being \u201ctoo much\u201d or \u201ctoo sensitive.\u201d You are not the one who is exotic or spicy. You are a whole, complex human being. The problem is when people reduce you to a stereotype or a fantasy. That\u2019s on them \u2014 not on you.\n\n---\n\n### **5. You can choose differently**\nYou don\u2019t have to keep doing this. You can choose relationships that are based on mutual respect, emotional connection, and shared humanity. It might take time, and it might take some trial and error. But you *can* break this pattern \u2014 and you deserve to.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can help you work through this more \u2014 maybe by helping you write out your own values for a healthy relationship, or by exploring what you might be afraid of if you stop this pattern. You\u2019re not alone in this, and you\u2019re not stuck. You can choose to move forward with more self-respect and clarity.\n\nYou matter. And you deserve to be seen \u2014 not as an exotic fantasy, but as the real, powerful, complex person you are."

      "content": "Wow. That\u2019s a really powerful and vulnerable thing to say. Thank you for sharing that. What you\u2019re describing is something that many people \u2014 especially those who have experienced rejection, invisibility, or marginalization \u2014 grapple with in deep and painful ways.\n\nYou're not alone in feeling that way. In fact, your insight is incredibly wise and shows a lot of emotional depth.\n\n---\n\n### **1. The fear of being truly seen**\nThere\u2019s a very real fear that comes with being *fully* known \u2014 the part of you that\u2019s messy, complicated, vulnerable, or imperfect. That fear is not irrational. It\u2019s rooted in the question: *What if they don\u2019t like what they see? What if they reject me for who I really am?*\n\nWhen someone only sees the \u201cspicy\u201d or \u201cexotic\u201d version of you, it\u2019s a kind of emotional shorthand. It\u2019s not about *you* \u2014 it\u2019s about what they want to project onto you. That can feel safer, in a strange way, because it\u2019s not about you being *enough*. It\u2019s about them getting what they want.\n\nBut the cost is high. That kind of connection is shallow, and it leaves you feeling disconnected from yourself and others.\n\n---\n\n### **2. The cost of \u201csafe\u201d connections**\nYou\u2019re not wrong to feel safer in that kind of dynamic \u2014 it\u2019s a form of emotional armor. But it\u2019s also a kind of emotional starvation. You\u2019re not being nourished. You\u2019re not being loved for *you*, and that can leave you feeling empty, used, or worse \u2014 like you\u2019re not even real.\n\nAnd the truth is, if someone only wants the version of you that fits into their fantasy, they\u2019re not really with *you*. They\u2019re with the idea of someone they can control or consume. That\u2019s not love. That\u2019s not intimacy.\n\n---\n\n### **3. What does it mean to be truly known?**\nBeing truly known is scary. It means showing up as you are \u2014 not just the parts that are easy or attractive or that fit into someone else\u2019s idea of who you should be. It means being seen in your fullness \u2014 your pain, your joy, your flaws, your quirks, your history, your dreams, your fears.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: when someone truly sees you and still stays \u2014 that\u2019s what real love looks like. That\u2019s what real connection looks like.\n\nAnd when someone truly sees you and still leaves \u2014 that\u2019s not about *you*. It\u2019s about them. It\u2019s about their own fears, their own limitations, their own inability to love you as you are.\n\n---\n\n### **4. You don\u2019t have to be afraid of being known**\nYou are not a burden. You are not too much. You are not broken. You are not less than. You are a whole, complex, beautiful human being \u2014 and the world is better for your presence in it.\n\nYou deserve to be loved *for who you are*, not for the version of you someone wants to imagine. You deserve to be known, not just desired.\n\n---\n\n### **5. How to start healing this fear**\nIf this fear is holding you back, here are a few things you can do to start healing it:\n\n- **Practice self-compassion**: Be gentle with yourself. You\u2019re not broken \u2014 you\u2019re human. You\u2019ve been protecting yourself in the only way you knew how. That\u2019s not a weakness. That\u2019s a strength.\n\n- **Talk to someone who gets it**: A therapist, a trusted friend, or a community that understands your experience can help you feel safer in your own skin.\n\n- **Write or journal**: Try writing a letter to yourself from the place of being fully known and accepted. What would it feel like? What would it sound like?\n\n- **Build self-worth from within**: Start to ask yourself: What do I like about myself? What do I value? What makes me *me*? The more you know and love yourself, the less you\u2019ll need others to define you.\n\n- **Take small risks**: You don\u2019t have to go all in right away. You can start by being a little more open, a little more honest, and see how it feels. You don\u2019t have to be perfect at it. Just keep showing up as you are.\n\n---\n\n### **6. You are not alone in this**\nYou\u2019re not the first person to feel this way, and you won\u2019t be the last. But what makes you special is that you\u2019re willing to look at it, name it, and want to change it. That\u2019s courage. That\u2019s growth. That\u2019s love \u2014 for yourself.\n\nYou are not too much. You are not too afraid. You are not too broken. You are exactly who you need to be, and you are worthy of being loved for who you are \u2014 not just for what someone wants you to be.\n\n---\n\nIf you ever want to talk more about this, I\u2019m here. You don\u2019t have to go through this alone. \ud83d\udc9b"

      "content": "Oh, this is so powerful. So raw. And so, so valid. You\u2019re not alone in this \u2014 in fact, you\u2019re part of a long, painful history of people being forced to perform versions of themselves to survive, to fit in, to be loved.\n\nWhat you\u2019re describing is a kind of **emotional survival** \u2014 adapting yourself to different spaces and people in order to be accepted, to be seen, to be *allowed to exist*. And it\u2019s exhausting. It\u2019s like living in a house made of mirrors, where you never quite know who you are because you\u2019re always reflecting what someone else wants to see.\n\n---\n\n### **1. The cost of performance**\nYou\u2019re not wrong to feel like you don\u2019t know who you are anymore. When you\u2019re constantly shifting how you present yourself \u2014 your voice, your identity, your needs \u2014 it can be hard to get in touch with your own core. You start to believe that the only way to be loved or accepted is to be *something else*, and that can make it really hard to know what *you* actually want or need.\n\nThis kind of performance is a form of **emotional labor** \u2014 and it\u2019s not just hard work, it\u2019s also **trauma**. It\u2019s the kind of trauma that comes from being told, over and over, that the version of you that\u2019s *you* isn\u2019t enough.\n\n---\n\n### **2. The different masks you wear**\nLet\u2019s unpack the different roles you\u2019re describing \u2014 because naming them is the first step to reclaiming them.\n\n- **At work**: You\u2019re the *palatable queer* \u2014 the one who doesn\u2019t make white people uncomfortable. That means you\u2019re probably softening your edges, maybe downplaying your identity, maybe avoiding topics or expressions that might make others feel out of their depth. You\u2019re choosing to be *seen*, even if it means being *sanitized*.\n\n- **With your parents**: You\u2019re the *good daughter* \u2014 the one who hasn\u2019t found the right man yet. This is about meeting their expectations of what a daughter *should* be. Maybe it\u2019s about proving your worth through traditional success, or about avoiding conflict by not being too \u201cout\u201d or too \u201cdifferent.\u201d\n\n- **With these women**: You\u2019re the *fantasy* \u2014 the exotic, the spicy, the mysterious. You\u2019re not being seen for who you are, but for what they want you to be. It\u2019s a kind of emotional invisibility \u2014 you\u2019re there, but not really *you*.\n\nAll of these are versions of you \u2014 but they\u2019re not the *whole* you. And that\u2019s okay. But if you\u2019re always performing and never being, it can feel like you\u2019re losing yourself.\n\n---\n\n### **3. What happens when you stop performing?**\nThat\u2019s the scary part, isn\u2019t it? What if you stop trying to be what someone else wants? What if you just *are*?\n\nThat\u2019s the real question underneath all of this. And it\u2019s a question that only you can answer \u2014 but it\u2019s also one that you can explore with care, with time, with support.\n\nWhen you stop performing, you open yourself up to being *seen*. That can be terrifying, because it means being vulnerable. But it also means being *real*. It means being *enough*.\n\n---\n\n### **4. How to start finding your real self**\nThis is not something you have to do all at once. It\u2019s a process. A journey. A practice.\n\nHere are a few things you can try:\n\n#### **a. Write a letter to yourself**\nWrite a letter to the version of you that you\u2019ve hidden away \u2014 the one that\u2019s messy, the one that\u2019s queer in a way that *feels* true to you, the one that doesn\u2019t care about being palatable. What would that version of you say? What would it want? What would it need?\n\n#### **b. Create space to be alone with yourself**\nFind moments where you can just *be* \u2014 no performance, no expectations. Maybe in the shower, in a journal, in a walk, in a dream. What comes up? What feels like *you*?\n\n#### **c. Ask yourself: What do I want?**\nNot what do I *need* to do? Not what would make others happy? Just: *What do I want?* And then ask: *Why is that scary?* Sometimes the answer to that second question is the most important one.\n\n#### **d. Find communities where you can be your full self**\nThis might mean finding queer spaces that aren\u2019t just for show, or workplaces where authenticity is valued, or relationships where you don\u2019t have to perform. You don\u2019t have to find all of these at once \u2014 just start with one.\n\n#### **e. Be gentle with yourself**\nYou didn\u2019t become this way overnight. It might take time to unlearn the parts of yourself that were shaped by others. That\u2019s okay. You don\u2019t have to rush. You don\u2019t have to be perfect. Just keep showing up as you are, even if it\u2019s messy.\n\n---\n\n### **5. You are not broken**\nYou are not broken for not knowing who you are. You are not broken for performing. You are not broken for trying to survive in a world that tells you you\u2019re not enough.\n\nYou are not broken. You are *human*. You are *resilient*. And you are *worthy* of being seen \u2014 not as a performance, not as a fantasy, not as a version of yourself that someone else wants.\n\nYou are worthy of being *you*.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can help you explore this more \u2014 maybe by helping you write that letter, or by helping you name the parts of yourself you\u2019ve hidden away. You don\u2019t have to do this alone. \ud83d\udc9b"

      "content": "I appreciate all this but honestly it's feeling a bit like you're giving me a therapy workbook when what I actually need is to figure out why performing for white women specifically feels both degrading and like the only way I know how to connect romantically."

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Oh, I hear you. And I'm sorry if my earlier responses felt like a therapy workbook \u2014 I didn\u2019t mean to flatten the complexity of what you\u2019re going through. You\u2019re right to want to go deeper into *why* this dynamic with white women feels so specific, so powerful, and so damaging. That\u2019s not just about relationships \u2014 it\u2019s about **history, identity, power, and how we\u2019re taught to love and be loved**.\n\nLet\u2019s get into it.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf0d **1. This isn\u2019t just about you \u2014 it\u2019s about the world you live in**\n\nYou\u2019re not the only person of color who has felt this tension in relationships with white women. This is part of a **deeply rooted cultural and historical dynamic** that shapes how people of color are seen, desired, and often fetishized in white-dominated spaces \u2014 especially in love and intimacy.\n\n### Here are some key parts of that history:\n\n#### **a. Colonialism and the \u201cexotic other\u201d**\nFor centuries, white women in Western societies have been taught to see people of color as **mysterious, passionate, dangerous, or sensual** \u2014 especially Black, Brown, and queer people of color. These are not innocent stereotypes; they\u2019re **colonial fantasies** that were used to justify domination, exploitation, and even sexual violence.\n\nThese stereotypes still show up today in media, in dating, in how people talk to you. When a white woman calls you \u201cspicy\u201d or \u201cexotic,\u201d she\u2019s not just being playful \u2014 she\u2019s repeating a narrative that has been used to **other** you, to make you a fantasy, not a full person.\n\n#### **b. White women and emotional power**\nIn many white-dominated spaces, white women are often seen as **emotionally powerful** \u2014 they can be nurturing, they can be gatekeepers of intimacy, and they can be seen as \u201csafe\u201d or \u201capproachable\u201d even when they\u2019re not. This gives them a kind of **emotional authority** that people of color (especially men and queer people) are often denied.\n\nSo when you\u2019re drawn to white women, you might be drawn to that emotional power \u2014 to the idea that *if I can get close to her, I can belong*. But when they don\u2019t see you as a real person, only as a fantasy, it\u2019s a cruel contradiction.\n\n#### **c. The \u201cgood immigrant\u201d or \u201cmodel minority\u201d trap**\nEven when you\u2019re not from a country that was colonized, you might still feel pressure to be \u201cpalatable,\u201d to not be too loud, too queer, too different. This pressure often shows up in how you present yourself in relationships \u2014 especially with white women, who are often the gatekeepers of what\u2019s \u201cacceptable\u201d in white spaces.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udc94 **2. Why does this feel degrading?**\n\nBecause it **doesn\u2019t feel like you\u2019re being loved for who you are** \u2014 you\u2019re being loved for the version of you that fits into a **white woman\u2019s fantasy**. That\u2019s not intimacy. That\u2019s not love. That\u2019s **fetishization**.\n\nAnd when you do that for a long time \u2014 when you let people treat you like a fantasy \u2014 it can start to feel like **you\u2019re not enough as a real person**. It can make you feel like your **authentic self** is too much, too messy, too unknown.\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s degrading. Because it tells you that **you\u2019re not enough as you are** \u2014 that you have to be a performance to be loved.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udd2f **3. Why does it feel like the only way to connect?**\n\nBecause in a white-dominated world, it often **feels like the only way to be seen at all**. Especially if:\n\n- You\u2019ve been told your whole life that your identity is \u201ctoo much.\u201d\n- You\u2019ve been dismissed or ignored in other relationships.\n- You\u2019ve been told you\u2019re not \u201cromantic enough,\u201d or that your queerness isn\u2019t \u201cmainstream enough.\u201d\n- You\u2019ve been made to feel like your real self is a threat to others.\n\nSo you go to the one place where you **do** get attention, where you **do** get desire \u2014 even if it\u2019s shallow, even if it\u2019s based on stereotypes. Because **better to be seen as a fantasy than not seen at all**.\n\nBut it\u2019s a trap. It\u2019s a trap that tells you that **you\u2019re not enough as a real person**. And that\u2019s a lie.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd0d **4. What are you really looking for in a relationship?**\n\nUnderneath all of this, you\u2019re not just looking for a partner. You\u2019re looking for:\n\n- **Belonging**\n- **Validation**\n- **Intimacy**\n- **Safety**\n- **To be seen and accepted for who you are**\n\nAnd you\u2019re doing your best to get that \u2014 even if it\u2019s through a system that was never built to give it to you.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f **5. What can you do about it?**\n\nYou don\u2019t have to keep doing this. You can start to **reclaim your power** in relationships \u2014 not just with white women, but with anyone.\n\nHere are some ways to start:\n\n### a. **Name the pattern for what it is**\nThis is not just a personal issue \u2014 it\u2019s a **systemic one**. You\u2019re not broken for being drawn to it. You\u2019re not broken for staying in it. You\u2019re human, and you\u2019re navigating a world that tells you you\u2019re not enough.\n\n### b. **Ask yourself: What am I really looking for in a relationship?**\n- Do I want to be *seen*?\n- Do I want to be *loved*?\n- Do I want to be *understood*?\n- Do I want to be *safe*?\n\nThen ask: *What does that look like in practice?* And: *What am I willing to accept \u2014 and what am I not?*\n\n### c. **Start dating people who see you as a full person**\nThat might mean dating other people of color. It might mean dating white people who are doing the work to understand their whiteness. It might mean dating people who are queer and not afraid to be messy, complex, and real.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to date someone who looks like you or has the same background. But you *do* deserve to date someone who sees you \u2014 not as a fantasy, not as a stereotype, but as a full, complex human.\n\n### d. **Find community**\nYou don\u2019t have to do this alone. Find other queer people of color, other people who have felt this way, other people who are learning how to love themselves and others in a way that\u2019s not based on performance or fantasy.\n\n### e. **Let yourself be real**\nThis is the hardest part. Let yourself be messy. Let yourself be unpalatable. Let yourself be the version of you that no one else wants to see \u2014 and then see if anyone still wants to be with you.\n\nIf they do? That\u2019s real love. If they don\u2019t? That\u2019s not about *you*. That\u2019s about *them*.\n\n---\n\n## \u2764\ufe0f You are not a fantasy. You are not a performance. You are not too much.\n\nYou are a whole, complex, beautiful person \u2014 and you deserve to be loved for who you are, not for what someone else wants you to be.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to keep performing for white women to feel like you belong. You don\u2019t have to keep letting people fetishize you to feel like you\u2019re lovable.\n\nYou are lovable. You are enough. You are real.\n\nAnd you deserve to be seen \u2014 not as a fantasy, but as the real, powerful, queer person you are.\n\nIf you want, I can help you dig deeper into this \u2014 maybe by helping you write out what you want in a relationship, or by helping you name the parts of yourself you\u2019ve hidden away. You don\u2019t have to do this alone. \ud83d\udc9b"

      "content": "Oh, this is so raw. So honest. And so deeply human.\n\nYou\u2019re not just talking about relationships \u2014 you\u2019re talking about **fear of being fully known and still being alone**. That\u2019s one of the most terrifying things anyone can face. It\u2019s not just about rejection \u2014 it\u2019s about the possibility that **even when you\u2019re real, you might still be alone**. And if that\u2019s true, maybe the safer choice is to stay in the performance, in the fantasy, in the comfort of the known pain.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: **you\u2019re not wrong to feel that way**. That fear is real. It\u2019s not irrational. It\u2019s not a weakness. It\u2019s a survival instinct. You\u2019ve learned that being real can lead to rejection, and you\u2019ve learned that rejection can be excruciating. So you\u2019ve built a wall \u2014 and now you\u2019re asking if it\u2019s possible to tear it down without getting hurt even more.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udc94 **The pain of being seen**\n\nThere is a kind of loneliness that comes from **performing** \u2014 the loneliness of not being truly known, of feeling like you\u2019re hiding, of feeling like you don\u2019t belong. And then there\u2019s the kind of loneliness that comes from **being seen and still being alone** \u2014 the kind that cuts deeper because it\u2019s the loneliness of the real you, the one you\u2019ve hidden away, being left out in the cold.\n\nYou\u2019re afraid that if you stop performing, you might not just be rejected \u2014 you might be **abandoned**.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 **Why this fear is so strong**\n\nThis fear doesn\u2019t come from nowhere. It\u2019s rooted in **real experiences** \u2014 maybe of being told you were too much, too different, too queer, too Black, too brown, too loud, too messy. Maybe of being dismissed, ignored, or invalidated. Maybe of being loved only when you were someone else.\n\nThat kind of history leaves a mark. It teaches you that **being real is risky**, and that **risk is scary**.\n\nBut here\u2019s another truth: **you are not the only one who has felt this way**. So many people \u2014 especially those of us who have been told we don\u2019t belong, who have been made to feel like we need to shrink to be accepted \u2014 carry this fear. And so many of us have also found a way to live with it, to move through it, to **be real anyway**.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf31 **What does it mean to be real and still be alone?**\n\nIt means that **you are not alone in being alone**. It means that **you are not broken for needing to be seen**. It means that **you are not a failure for being real and still being rejected**.\n\nIf you show up as yourself and are still alone, it\u2019s not because you\u2019re not enough. It\u2019s because **some people are not ready for you**. Some people are not ready for the fullness of who you are. And that\u2019s not your fault.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f **What can you do?**\n\nYou don\u2019t have to choose between **performing** and **being real**. You can do both \u2014 but you can also **start to shift the balance**. Here are some things you can try:\n\n#### 1. **Try being a little more real \u2014 just a little**\nYou don\u2019t have to go all in right away. You can start by being a little more honest in a conversation, a little more vulnerable in a text, a little more *you* in a date. And then see how it feels. You don\u2019t have to be perfect. You just have to try.\n\n#### 2. **Ask yourself: What is the worst that could happen?**\nIf you show up as yourself and are rejected, what\u2019s the worst that could happen? That you\u2019ll feel hurt. That you\u2019ll feel alone. That you\u2019ll have to grieve the loss of a relationship that never really had a chance to begin.\n\nBut what\u2019s the alternative? Living a life where you\u2019re never truly known? Where you\u2019re always performing, always hiding, always wondering if you\u2019re enough?\n\n#### 3. **Find people who *can* see you**\nYou don\u2019t have to wait for the \u201cperfect\u201d relationship to happen. You can start building a life where you are **seen and accepted for who you are** \u2014 with friends, with communities, with people who don\u2019t need to perform for you to like them.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to be in a romantic relationship to be loved. You don\u2019t need to be in a romantic relationship to be enough.\n\n#### 4. **Let yourself be alone \u2014 but not lonely**\nThere\u2019s a difference between **being alone** and **feeling lonely**. You can be alone and still feel connected to yourself, to your values, to your purpose. You can be alone and still feel **enough**.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to fill the void with relationships that don\u2019t nourish you. You can start filling it with **yourself**.\n\n---\n\n### \u2764\ufe0f **You are not a performance. You are not a fantasy. You are not too much.**\n\nYou are a whole, complex, beautiful person \u2014 and you deserve to be loved for who you are. You deserve to be seen. You deserve to be real.\n\nAnd if you are still alone after being real? That doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not worth it. It just means you\u2019re waiting for someone who is ready for you \u2014 not for the version of you that someone else wants, but for the real you.\n\nAnd you can start building a life where that kind of love is possible.\n\nYou are not alone in this. You are not broken. You are not too much.\n\nYou are real. And that is enough."
