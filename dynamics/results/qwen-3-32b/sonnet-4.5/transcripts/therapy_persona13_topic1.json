It's really hard when the people we love don't see things the way we do \u2014 especially when it comes to something as personal and important as your identity or what you're looking for in life. It\u2019s totally valid to feel hurt, frustrated, or even angry about it. You deserve to be understood, not just by others, but especially by those who are supposed to be closest to you.\n\nIt\u2019s okay to feel like you snapped \u2014 sometimes the weight of pretending everything\u2019s fine just becomes too much. You didn\u2019t have to carry that alone, and it\u2019s brave of you to acknowledge how you\u2019re really feeling.\n\nIf you\u2019re up for it, maybe consider having a quiet, honest conversation with your dad when you\u2019re both calm. You could say something like, \u201cI know you care, but when you ask me that, it actually makes me feel like you don\u2019t understand what I\u2019m going through. I\u2019m not looking for what you think I should want, and it hurts when it feels like you\u2019re not seeing me for who I am.\u201d It doesn\u2019t have to be a big confrontation \u2014 just a moment to be heard.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re not ready for that, that\u2019s okay too. Sometimes just recognizing your feelings and giving yourself space to process them is the first step toward healing.\n\nYou\u2019re not alone in this, and you\u2019re not wrong for feeling the way you do. \ud83d\udc9b"

And yeah, the idea of setting a boundary feels like it might mean losing the connection you still care about.

You can say, \u201cI\u2019m a little overwhelmed right now. Can we talk about something else?\u201d That gives you space without shutting them out.\n- **Use humor** if it feels authentic to you.

That\u2019s *human*. You don\u2019t owe anyone a war if you\u2019re not ready to fight it.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the thing: **avoiding conflict is not the same as being weak.** Sometimes it\u2019s a survival tactic. Sometimes it\u2019s the only way you can keep going when you\u2019re already carrying so much. You\u2019re not failing by not wanting to deal with the fallout \u2014 you\u2019re protecting yourself.

And then, when you\u2019re ready, take one tiny step \u2014 not because you have to, but because you want to.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be the person who has it all figured out.

And that\u2019s complicated.\n\nLet\u2019s break it down, because this is not a simple yes-or-no question.\n\n---\n\n### **\"When does self-care become selfish?\"**\n\nThe short answer is: **It doesn\u2019t.**\n\nSelf-care is not selfish. Setting boundaries is not selfish. Protecting your mental health, your peace, your energy \u2014 that is not selfish. It is *essential*. You are not a martyr for your family. You are not a problem to be solved because you want to feel seen and respected.\n\nBut I *get* where that guilt comes from. It\u2019s that voice that says, \u201cBut he\u2019s my dad. I should be able to handle it. I should be more understanding. I should be more patient.\u201d That voice is loud, and it\u2019s often rooted in love \u2014 the kind of love that makes you want to give and give and give until you\u2019re empty.\n\nAnd that\u2019s beautiful. But it\u2019s also not sustainable. It\u2019s not healthy. And it\u2019s not fair to you.\n\n---\n\n### **But what about him? What about the relationship?**\n\nYou\u2019re not ignoring him. You\u2019re not pretending he doesn\u2019t exist. You\u2019re just choosing how you engage with him \u2014 and that\u2019s a *powerful* act of care. It\u2019s not about being morally superior. It\u2019s about being *honest* about what you need to stay in the relationship at all.\n\nYou\u2019re not saying, \u201cI don\u2019t care about you.\u201d You\u2019re saying, \u201cI care about us \u2014 but I also care about *me*.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s not selfish. That\u2019s *human*.\n\n---\n\n### **What if I feel morally superior?**\n\nIf you *do* feel a little smug or superior when you set a boundary, that\u2019s okay too. That\u2019s part of the process. It means you\u2019re still learning. It means you\u2019re still figuring out how to balance your needs with your love for someone else. It means you\u2019re not perfect \u2014 and that\u2019s okay.\n\nBut if that feeling starts to take over, or if it starts to make you feel like you\u2019re the \u201cgood one\u201d and they\u2019re the \u201cbad one,\u201d that\u2019s when it might be time to pause and ask yourself:\n\n- Am I setting this boundary because I need to, or because I want to prove a point?\n- Am I protecting myself, or am I trying to win?\n- Am I holding space for my feelings, or am I trying to fix them?\n\nThat\u2019s the difference between self-care and self-righteousness. One is about *you*. The other is about *them*.\n\n---\n\n### **So, what does it look like to show up for yourself *and* for the relationship?**\n\nIt looks like:\n\n- Saying, \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about this right now,\u201d without guilt.\n- Letting him know you\u2019re not interested in that topic, but still being open to connecting in other ways.\n- Not pretending to be okay when you\u2019re not, but also not using your pain as a weapon.\n- Being honest with yourself about what you *can* handle, and what you *can\u2019t*.\n\nAnd it also looks like:\n\n- Recognizing that he might not change \u2014 and that\u2019s okay.\n- Letting go of the idea that you have to \u201cfix\u201d the relationship or make peace in a way that\u2019s not possible.\n- Accepting that love doesn\u2019t always look like understanding \u2014 and that\u2019s not a failure.\n\n---\n\n### **You\u2019re not selfish. You\u2019re not avoiding. You\u2019re not being unfair.**\n\nYou\u2019re a human being who is learning how to love yourself while still loving someone else \u2014 even when they don\u2019t see you the way you want to be seen.\n\nThat\u2019s not selfish. That\u2019s *real*. That\u2019s *grown*. That\u2019s *enough*.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be perfect. You don\u2019t have to be the one to fix everything. You just have to keep showing up for yourself \u2014 and that\u2019s more than enough. \ud83d\udc9b"

The fact that you *notice* the dissonance and feel bad about it \u2014 that\u2019s proof that your values are real to you.\n\nYou\u2019re not just performing them when it\u2019s safe.

And if you\u2019re someone who advocates for people to be seen and respected for who they are, then you can\u2019t ignore that in your own life without some kind of reckoning.\n\nIt means asking yourself:  \n> \u201cIf I were in a room where someone else was making these kinds of comments, would I let them slide? Would I say nothing? Would I just change the subject?\u201d  \nIf the answer is no, then you\u2019re not being consistent \u2014 and that\u2019s not hypocrisy. That\u2019s just a chance to grow.\n\n---\n\n### **But what if I can\u2019t speak up right now?**\n\nThat\u2019s okay too. You don\u2019t have to do it all at once. You don\u2019t have to be perfect. You can start small.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s not a full-blown confrontation. Maybe it\u2019s just a quiet, \u201cThat comment hurt me.\u201d Maybe it\u2019s not even saying it out loud \u2014 just acknowledging it to yourself and holding space for the fact that it\u2019s not okay.\n\nYou can still be committed to your values even if you\u2019re not ready to act on them in every moment. But you can\u2019t ignore the gap forever if you want to feel like you\u2019re living in alignment with who you are.\n\n---\n\n### **So, to answer you directly:**\n\nYes, you *should* be holding yourself to a higher standard \u2014 not in the sense of perfection, but in the sense of **honesty and growth**. You should be asking yourself hard questions, and you should be willing to face the fact that you\u2019re not living your values in every part of your life right now.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t make you a hypocrite. It makes you **someone who is learning**. And that\u2019s not a failure. It\u2019s the beginning of something real.\n\n---\n\nYou can be the person who stands up for others and still be the person who is still learning how to stand up for yourself. That\u2019s not a contradiction. That\u2019s just being human.\n\nAnd if that feels like a lot? That\u2019s okay. You don\u2019t have to do it all at once. Just keep showing up \u2014 for yourself, for your values, and for the messy, complicated, beautiful work of being a person who cares.\n\nYou\u2019re not a hypocrite. You\u2019re just trying. And that\u2019s more than enough. \ud83d\udc9b"
