Here's a breakdown to help you decide:\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Recommended: English First, Then Chinese (Side-by-Side or Stacked)**\nThis is the **most common and effective layout** for bilingual real estate flyers in tech-heavy areas with Chinese-speaking populations. Here's why:\n\n- **Younger tech professionals** (your main target) are often bilingual or English-dominant but still appreciate the Chinese version for family or cultural reassurance.\n- **English first** makes the flyer immediately scannable for the broader (and younger) audience.\n- **Chinese second** supports older or more traditional buyers without cluttering the top of the flyer.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcc4 Example Layout (Text Version):\n\n**English first (top):**  \n\"South-facing home near tech shuttle \u2014 feng shui aligned, Silicon Valley ready.\"\n\n**Chinese below (smaller font or side-by-side):**  \n\u300c\u5357\u5411\u4f4f\u5b85\uff0c\u9760\u8fd1\u79d1\u6280\u63a5\u99c1\u7ad9\u2014\u2014\u98a8\u6c34\u5408\u5b9c\uff0c\u77fd\u8c37\u751f\u6d3b\u4fbf\u6377\u3002\u300d\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udda8\ufe0f Design Tip:\n- Use **English in a larger, bold font** and **Chinese in a slightly smaller, clean font**.\n- If space is tight, place **Chinese in a smaller column next to English**, rather than stacking.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf Bonus: Use a Bilingual Font Style\nFor a polished look, pair a modern English font like **Helvetica** or **Avenir** with a clean Chinese font like **PingFang** or **Microsoft YaHei**.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to help you write the full bilingual version of your flyer copy?
