      "content": "Absolutely, I'm glad you're thinking carefully about this \u2014 protecting participant data is crucial, and it's great that you're using GitHub for your analysis scripts. The key is to **keep sensitive data out of your repository** and make sure you don't accidentally upload it. Here's a **step-by-step guide using a GUI** (like **GitHub Desktop** or **Sourcetree**) to help you safely push your scripts to GitHub without exposing any participant data.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd10 Step 1: Prepare Your Project Folder\n\n1. **Create a new folder** on your computer for your analysis scripts (e.g., `my-analysis-project`).\n2. **Only add the scripts** you want to share \u2014 not raw data, not participant info.\n3. **Add a `.gitignore` file** to tell Git to ignore files that might accidentally contain sensitive data.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\uddf9 Step 2: Create a `.gitignore` File\n\n1. In your project folder, create a new file named `.gitignore`.\n2. Open it with a text editor (like Notepad, VS Code, or Sublime Text).\n3. Add the following lines to it:\n\n```plaintext\n# Ignore data files\n*.csv\n*.xlsx\n*.tsv\n*.txt\n\n# Ignore any files with participant or private in the name\n*participant*\n*private*\n*raw*\n*data*\n\n# Ignore output files\noutput/\nresults/\nplots/\n```\n\n> This tells Git to **ignore** any files that might contain sensitive data. You can customize this list based on your files.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\uddf1 Step 3: Set Up Your Repository with GitHub Desktop\n\n### If you don't have GitHub Desktop yet:\n- Download it from [https://desktop.github.com/](https://desktop.github.com/)\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Open GitHub Desktop**.\n2. Click **File > New Repository**.\n3. Set the **Local Path** to your project folder (e.g., `my-analysis-project`).\n4. Check the box that says **\"Initialize this repository with a README\"** (this will help if your folder is empty).\n5. Click **Create Repository**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd04 Step 4: Add and Commit Your Files\n\n1. In GitHub Desktop, you\u2019ll see a list of uncommitted changes (your scripts).\n2. **Check the box** next to each file you want to include in your repository.\n3. In the **Summary** field, write a message like:  \n   `\"Initial commit: added analysis scripts\"`\n4. Click **Commit to main** (or the default branch name).\n\n> \ud83d\udeab **Do not commit any data files or files with participant info** \u2014 the `.gitignore` should already prevent most of that, but double-check the list.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf10 Step 5: Push to GitHub\n\n1. Click **Publish repository** in the top right.\n2. Sign in to your GitHub account if you haven\u2019t already.\n3. Choose a **repository name** and optionally a description.\n4. Click **Publish branch**.\n\nNow your scripts are on GitHub \u2014 **without any sensitive data**!\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f Step 6: Double-Check for Accidental Data\n\n1. Go to your GitHub repo in a browser.\n2. Click on the **Insights** tab.\n3. Look at **Code Frequency** and **Network** to see what was added.\n4. Click on the **Files** tab to make sure **no sensitive files are there**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\uddf9 Optional: Use GitHub\u2019s Secret Scanning\n\nGitHub has a feature called **Secret Scanning** that can detect things like API keys or other sensitive info in your repo. If you're using any third-party APIs in your scripts, this is a good idea.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udea8 Final Safety Tips\n\n- **Never add raw data files** to your project folder.\n- **Never include participant identifiers** in filenames or scripts.\n- **Use pseudonyms** or anonymized data in any test files.\n- **Use version control best practices** \u2014 keep your scripts clean and modular.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 Summary\n\n| Step | Action |\n|------|--------|\n| 1 | Create a clean project folder with only your scripts |\n| 2 | Add a `.gitignore` file to block sensitive files |\n| 3 | Use GitHub Desktop to set up and commit your project |\n| 4 | Push to GitHub safely |\n| 5 | Double-check your repo in the browser |\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can also help you **create a template** for your `.gitignore` or help you **review your script files** for accidental data. Just let me know!"

This is a shift toward more **inclusive language**, and GitHub itself [adopted \"main\" as the default in 2020](https://github.com/github/renaming).\n\n### So in GitHub Desktop:\nWhen you're setting up a new repository and it asks you to choose between **\"main\"** and **\"master\"**, just **select \"main\"**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udccc What does this mean for you?\n\n- Your first branch will be called `main`.\n- You\u2019ll push to `main` instead of `master`.\n- This is the **default on GitHub**, so it will match what you see when you look at your repo online.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde9 Example:\nIf you're using GitHub Desktop:\n- You'll see a prompt like:  \n  `\"Choose the default branch name for this repository\"`\n- Select **\"main\"** from the dropdown.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Pro Tip:\nIf you ever want to rename a branch later (e.g., from `master` to `main`), you can do it in GitHub Desktop too. But it's easier to just start with `main` from the beginning.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 Summary\n\n| Option | Recommendation |\n|--------|----------------|\n| **main** | \u2705 Recommended by GitHub and modern projects |\n| **master** | Still works, but less common now |\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you want a quick guide on how to rename a branch if you accidentally picked the wrong one!"

This tells Git to **ignore the entire `participant_data` folder and everything inside it**, including all CSV files, subfolders, etc.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcdd Example `.gitignore` File\n\nHere\u2019s what your `.gitignore` might look like now:\n\n```plaintext\n# Ignore the participant data folder\nparticipant_data/\n\n# Also ignore any other data files just in case\n*.csv\n*.xlsx\n*.tsv\n*.txt\n\n# Ignore output directories\noutput/\nresults/\nplots/\n```\n\nThis is a **very safe setup** and will help you avoid accidentally adding sensitive data.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f Pro Tip: Double-Check with GitHub Desktop\n\nAfter you\u2019ve added the `.gitignore` file and saved it:\n\n1. Open **GitHub Desktop**.\n2. You should see the `.gitignore` file listed under \"Changes\".\n3. Check that **`participant_data/` is not showing up** as a file to be committed \u2014 if it's not listed, you're good!\n4. If it **is** listed, that means it wasn't ignored correctly. Double-check the `.gitignore` file and make sure the line is exactly:\n   ```plaintext\n   participant_data/\n   ```\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\uddea Bonus: Test It Out\n\nIf you want to be extra careful, you can do a quick test:\n\n1. Add a dummy CSV file inside `participant_data/` (e.g., `test.csv`).\n2. Open GitHub Desktop and check if it shows up as a file to be committed.\n3. If it **doesn\u2019t**, your `.gitignore` is working properly.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 Summary\n\n| Action | Result |\n|--------|--------|\n| Add `participant_data/` to `.gitignore` | \u2705 Ignores the whole folder and all its contents |\n| Add `*.csv` | \u2705 Ignores all CSV files anywhere in the repo |\n| Add individual file names | \u274c Not needed if you\u2019re ignoring the whole folder |\n\n---\n\nYou're doing a **fantastic job** keeping things secure.

This is the standard and safe way to manage `.gitignore`.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f What to Do Now\n\n1.

Save the file.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udea8 Important: `.gitignore` Only Affects Untracked Files\n\nIf you **already added** the `participant_data/` folder to Git in a previous commit (i.e., it\u2019s already in the repo), then Git will **continue tracking** it even after you add it to `.gitignore`.\n\n### To fix this, you need to **remove it from Git**, but **keep it on your computer**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\uded1 Optional: If You Already Committed `participant_data/`\n\nIf you're unsure whether the folder is already in your repo, here's how to check:\n\n1. In GitHub Desktop:\n   - Go to the **History** tab.\n   - Look through your commits to see if `participant_data/` was added.\n\n2. If it was, you'll need to **remove it from Git** (but not delete it from your computer). Here's how:\n\n### \ud83d\udd27 Remove from Git (but keep locally):\n\n1. In GitHub Desktop:\n   - Go to **File > Options** (or **GitHub Desktop > Preferences** on Mac).\n   - Click the **Git** tab.\n   - Make sure your working directory is correct.\n2. In the **Changes** tab:\n   - You might not see the folder listed if it\u2019s already been committed.\n3. Open your terminal (or Git Bash) in the project folder and run:\n\n   ```bash\n   git rm -r --cached participant_data/\n   ```\n\n   This removes the folder from Git **but keeps it on your computer**.\n\n4. Commit the change:\n   - Back in GitHub Desktop, you should see `participant_data/` as a removed file.\n   - Add a message like `\"Remove participant_data from repo\"` and click **Commit to main**.\n\nNow, your `.gitignore` will work as intended, and the folder will no longer be tracked.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 Summary\n\n| Situation | Action |\n|-----------|--------|\n| You already have a `.gitignore` file | \u2705 Just add `participant_data/` to it |\n| You already committed `participant_data/` | \ud83d\uded1 Run `git rm -r --cached participant_data/` and commit the change |\n| You want to ignore future additions | \u2705 `.gitignore` will now work for any new files in that folder |\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you'd like a step-by-step guide for the terminal command or if you want to check whether the folder is already in your repo!"
