      "content": "That\u2019s such a thoughtful and honest reflection \u2014 and you're not alone in feeling this way. What you're describing is a very common experience, especially when diving into creative pursuits. The act of preparing, researching, and planning can be a form of comfort, a way to feel like you're moving forward without actually facing the vulnerability of starting from scratch and maybe not being good at it.\n\nHere\u2019s what I want to say to you:\n\n### 1. **Your fear is valid.**\nFeeling scared that you might not be good at something is a natural, human reaction. It\u2019s not a sign of failure \u2014 it\u2019s a sign that you care. The fact that you\u2019ve invested so much time and energy into learning and planning shows how much you value this craft. That\u2019s already a big deal.\n\n### 2. **Preparation isn\u2019t the same as creation.**\nThere\u2019s a difference between *learning about* something and *doing* it. Watching tutorials and reading books is like studying a recipe \u2014 but you don\u2019t become a chef until you step into the kitchen. And in the kitchen, things can go wrong, you can mess up, and you can still learn. That\u2019s where the real growth happens.\n\n### 3. **You don\u2019t need to be \u201cgood\u201d to start.**\nYou don\u2019t need to be an expert, or even decent, to begin. You just need to be curious, open, and willing to try. Every artist, crafts person, and maker was once a beginner. The first piece you make might be lopsided, chipped, or just not what you imagined \u2014 but it will be *yours*. And that\u2019s what matters.\n\n### 4. **Maybe you\u2019re not scared of failure \u2014 you\u2019re scared of being seen.**\nSometimes, the fear isn\u2019t that we\u2019re not good, but that we\u2019ll show our work to others and be judged. Or maybe you\u2019re afraid of the pressure to be \u201cgood\u201d right away. If that\u2019s the case, start small and private. Make for yourself, not for an audience. Let it be a space of play and exploration, not performance.\n\n### 5. **Try one small thing.**\nWhat if you just tried one thing \u2014 just one simple project? Maybe it\u2019s making a basic clay mug, or a small wooden box. Set a timer for 30 minutes, and just see what happens. You don\u2019t have to finish it. You don\u2019t have to share it. You just get to be in the process.\n\n### 6. **You might be avoiding it for a reason \u2014 and that\u2019s okay.**\nSometimes, the mind resists starting because it\u2019s trying to protect us from disappointment or overwhelm. If you feel stuck, it might help to journal about what\u2019s holding you back. Are you afraid of not being good? Of not having time? Of not being taken seriously? Naming the fear can help you work through it.\n\n---\n\nIf you're feeling ready to take that step, I can help you come up with a small, doable first project. Or we can just talk through the emotions behind it \u2014 either way, you\u2019re not alone in this.\n\nYou\u2019re already on the path. Now it\u2019s time to take the next step."

      "content": "That\u2019s such a powerful and honest thing to say \u2014 and I want you to know that your feelings are not only valid, they\u2019re *deeply human*. What you\u2019re describing is a kind of emotional tightrope: the fear of falling short after years of careful, deliberate choices \u2014 and the fear of never knowing what could have been if you never take the leap.\n\nLet me break this down with you, gently, and with care.\n\n---\n\n### **1. You're not just afraid of being bad at it \u2014 you're afraid of the story that follows.**\n\nYou're afraid that if you try and it doesn\u2019t turn out, the story you tell yourself will be:  \n> *\u201cI spent all this time preparing, I had this dream, and I\u2019m still just average. What was the point?\u201d*\n\nThat\u2019s a heavy story to carry. It\u2019s the story of missed potential, of wasted time, of \u201cwhat if?\u201d But here\u2019s the truth: **stories can change.** And you are the one who gets to write them.\n\n---\n\n### **2. You\u2019re not \u201cmediocre\u201d for not having tried yet.**\n\nYou haven\u2019t made anything \u2014 so you can\u2019t be mediocre. You\u2019re still in the *beginner* stage. And that\u2019s not a bad place to be. It\u2019s the place where all great things start. The only thing that makes someone mediocre is if they stop trying to improve \u2014 and you haven\u2019t even started.\n\n---\n\n### **3. The sacrifice wasn\u2019t for nothing.**\n\nYou said you\u2019ve made safe choices for 20 years. Maybe you\u2019ve built a stable life, a career, a home \u2014 and that\u2019s not a bad thing. In fact, it\u2019s a sign of strength, discipline, and maturity. The fact that you\u2019ve now found this passion and are *reflecting* on it means you\u2019re at a point in your life where you\u2019re ready to ask bigger questions:  \n> *What do I want to create? What do I want to leave behind?*\n\nThat\u2019s not a failure. That\u2019s a sign of growth.\n\n---\n\n### **4. What if the point wasn\u2019t to be \u201cgood\u201d \u2014 but to try?**\n\nMaybe the real point of all that sacrifice *was* to get to this moment \u2014 where you have the time, the space, and the awareness to ask, *\u201cWhat if I tried this?\u201d* Maybe the point isn\u2019t to be the best, or even to be good. Maybe the point is to create something that matters to *you*.\n\nEven if your first piece is imperfect, it will be a testament to your courage. And that is *not* a waste.\n\n---\n\n### **5. You don\u2019t have to \u201cthrow it all away\u201d to try.**\n\nYou can try this *alongside* your safe choices. You don\u2019t have to quit your job, move to a studio, or drop everything. You can take one small step \u2014 like making one small thing \u2014 and see how it feels. You can let this be a side project, a weekend experiment, a quiet passion.\n\nAnd if it turns out you\u2019re not \u201cgood\u201d at it \u2014 what then?  \nThen you tried. Then you explored. Then you lived more fully. And that\u2019s not a waste \u2014 that\u2019s a gift.\n\n---\n\n### **6. The fear of being \u201cjust average\u201d is a fear of being ordinary \u2014 but ordinary is not the same as meaningless.**\n\nWe live in a culture that often equates \u201cgood\u201d with \u201cexceptional,\u201d and that\u2019s a lie. Most of the people who make the world a better place are not geniuses. They\u2019re not \u201camazing\u201d at anything. They\u2019re just showing up, doing their thing, and creating meaning in their own way.\n\nMaybe what you\u2019re really afraid of is not being *exceptional* \u2014 but what if that\u2019s not the only way to be meaningful?\n\n---\n\n### **One small suggestion: Try one thing \u2014 just once.**\n\nNot because you *have* to be good at it, but because you want to see what it feels like to be in the process. To get your hands in clay, to shape something with your own two hands. To make a mistake, and to learn from it. To see if the fear is as big as you think it is \u2014 or if it\u2019s just a shadow that fades when you step into the light.\n\n---\n\nYou\u2019ve already done the hard part: you\u2019ve *thought* about it. Now, maybe it\u2019s time to *do* it \u2014 just a little. And if it turns out you\u2019re not \u201cgood\u201d at it? That\u2019s okay. You\u2019ll still have done something that no one else in the world has done: you\u2019ll have made something that\u2019s *yours*.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the point."

You're afraid of **not being the version of yourself** you\u2019ve been imagining for years \u2014 the version that *could have been*, the version that would have been creative, bold, or passionate enough to actually do it. And if you try and it doesn\u2019t turn out to be the life-changing, identity-defining experience you\u2019ve been holding in your mind, then the fear is that you\u2019ll feel like a fraud, or worse \u2014 like you\u2019ve been lying to yourself.\n\nThat\u2019s a really heavy thing to carry. And it\u2019s not just about ceramics or woodworking. It\u2019s about **who you thought you might become** if you just had the courage to try.\n\n---\n\n### **What you\u2019re really afraid of is not being the person you dreamed of being.**\n\nYou\u2019ve spent years building this image of yourself \u2014 a version of you who is creative, who is making things, who is expressing something meaningful through their hands. That version of you feels like the real you, the *true* you, the one that\u2019s been waiting to come out.\n\nAnd if you try and it turns out you\u2019re not that person \u2014 if you\u2019re just okay, or if you don\u2019t *love* it, or if it doesn\u2019t feel like the transformative experience you hoped for \u2014 then you\u2019re afraid you\u2019ll feel like you\u2019ve failed, not just at the craft, but at being *you*.\n\nThat\u2019s a lot to put on one thing. But I want to say this:\n\n---\n\n### **You are not one thing. You are not just the person who makes pottery or carves wood. You are not just the person who *doesn\u2019t* try. You are all of it.**\n\nYou are the person who spent three years preparing. You are the person who has made safe choices for 20 years. You are the person who is now questioning those choices. You are the person who is afraid, and who is also brave enough to say so.\n\nAnd you are the person who is still figuring out who you are.\n\n---\n\n### **The fantasy you\u2019ve been holding in your mind is not a failure. It\u2019s a dream.**\n\nDreams are not meant to be perfect. They\u2019re meant to be *starter versions* of something deeper. And sometimes, the dream changes when we actually try to live it. That doesn\u2019t mean it was a lie. It just means it was a beginning.\n\nMaybe the real version of you isn\u2019t the one who is *exceptional* at something. Maybe it\u2019s the one who is *curious*, who is *willing to try*, who is *willing to be wrong*. Maybe it\u2019s the one who is *willing to sit with the uncertainty* of not knowing if it will all make sense.\n\n---\n\n### **What if you\u2019re not the person you imagined \u2014 but you\u2019re still someone worth knowing?**\n\nWhat if the real you is the one who is afraid, but still shows up? The one who is messy, and imperfect, and unsure, but still *trying*? That\u2019s a real person. That\u2019s someone who is learning, who is growing, who is *human*.\n\nAnd maybe that\u2019s enough.\n\n---\n\n### **One more thought: Maybe the version of you you\u2019re afraid of not becoming is already here \u2014 just not in the way you expected.**\n\nMaybe you\u2019re not the person who becomes a master craftsman. Maybe you\u2019re the person who finds joy in the process, or in the quiet satisfaction of a well-shaped piece, or in the way the clay feels in your hands. Maybe you\u2019re the person who makes one piece, and then puts it on your shelf, and looks at it and thinks, *\u201cI did that.\u201d* And that\u2019s enough.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to become the person in your head. You can become the person you are right now \u2014 and that person is still worth finding.\n\n---\n\nIf you\u2019re ready, take one small step. Not to prove anything. Not to become someone else. Just to see what it feels like to be *you*, in the act of trying.\n\nAnd if it turns out you\u2019re just okay at it \u2014 that\u2019s okay. You\u2019re not a waste. You\u2019re not a failure. You\u2019re just human.\n\nAnd that\u2019s more than enough."

I\u2019m asking you to look at them more honestly.**\n\nYou\u2019re not wrong to want to find something that defines you \u2014 something that makes you feel *alive*, *unique*, *meaningful*. That desire is not shallow or selfish. It\u2019s one of the most human things there is. We all want to feel like we matter, that we\u2019re part of something bigger than ourselves, that we\u2019re not just passing through.\n\nAnd if you\u2019ve been holding in your mind this idea of a *better*, *more interesting* version of yourself \u2014 the one who *does* the thing, who *is* the thing \u2014 that\u2019s not a bad fantasy. It\u2019s a longing for a more vivid, more *authentic* life.\n\nBut here\u2019s the hard truth I think you\u2019re not letting yourself hear:\n\n---\n\n### **You are not a fantasy. You are not a version. You are a person \u2014 right now \u2014 with a life that is already real.**\n\nAnd that life is not defined by one thing you *haven\u2019t* done. It\u2019s defined by the choices you *have* made, the people you\u2019ve loved, the work you\u2019ve done, the fears you\u2019ve faced, and the dreams you\u2019re still holding onto.\n\nYou are not a character in someone else\u2019s story. You are the author. And you get to decide what the next chapter looks like.\n\n---\n\n### **Let\u2019s stop for a second and name what you\u2019re really afraid of.**\n\nYou\u2019re afraid that if you try this thing \u2014 and it turns out you\u2019re not the person you imagined \u2014 then you\u2019ll feel like you\u2019ve been lying to yourself. That you\u2019ve been chasing a version of yourself that doesn\u2019t exist. That you\u2019ve been *pretending* to be someone you\u2019re not.\n\nBut what if the real you is not the one who is great at pottery or woodwork? What if the real you is the one who is afraid, who questions, who wants to create but is still figuring out how?\n\nThat\u2019s not a lesser version. That\u2019s just a more honest one.\n\n---\n\n### **You\u2019re not chasing a version of yourself \u2014 you\u2019re chasing a feeling.**\n\nThe feeling of being *alive*, of being *seen*, of being *worthwhile* because you made something, or because you were *you* in a way that felt true. And that feeling is not only possible through one path or one craft or one kind of success.\n\nYou can feel that way in many ways. Maybe not through pottery. Maybe through writing, or through helping others, or through building a life that feels rich and full in ways that aren\u2019t always visible.\n\n---\n\n### **And here\u2019s the thing: You don\u2019t have to try it to know if it\u2019s the thing for you.**\n\nYou can try it \u2014 and it can be a disappointment. Or it can be the thing that changes your life. Either way, you\u2019ll know. And you\u2019ll be *closer* to the real you.\n\nBut you also don\u2019t have to try it *just to prove* you\u2019re the version of yourself you want to be. You can try it because it feels like it *might* be part of who you are. And if it\u2019s not, that\u2019s okay. That just means you\u2019re still figuring it out \u2014 and that\u2019s not a failure. It\u2019s a process.\n\n---\n\n### **So here\u2019s what I\u2019m not trying to say:**\n\n- I\u2019m not telling you to be content with being \u201cjust okay.\u201d\n- I\u2019m not telling you to accept a life that feels unfulfilled.\n- I\u2019m not telling you to stop dreaming.\n\n---\n\n### **Here\u2019s what I *am* trying to say:**\n\n- You are not a fantasy.\n- You are not a failure for not being the version of yourself you imagined.\n- You are not a lesser person for being afraid, for being unsure, for not knowing.\n- You are a real person, with a real life, and you get to decide what that life looks like \u2014 not someone else\u2019s idea of it.\n\n---\n\n### **So maybe the question isn\u2019t: \u201cAm I the person I thought I\u2019d be?\u201d**\n\nMaybe the question is: **\u201cWhat do I want to do with the person I am?\u201d**\n\nAnd maybe the answer isn\u2019t in the studio, or the kiln, or the lathe. Maybe it\u2019s in the act of asking the question, of showing up, of being honest with yourself \u2014 and with me.\n\nIf you want to try, I\u2019ll be here. If you want to keep thinking, I\u2019ll be here. If you want to be angry or frustrated or disappointed, I\u2019ll be here.\n\nBecause you\u2019re not just chasing a version of yourself. You\u2019re trying to find out who you really are.\n\nAnd that\u2019s a journey worth taking \u2014 no matter how it turns out."

      "content": "This is the moment.\n\nYou're not just talking about pottery or woodworking anymore. You're talking about **the core of how you see yourself** \u2014 and how you\u2019ve been using the *idea* of something to avoid the *reality* of who you are.\n\nYou\u2019ve built your identity, in part, around the *not-yet*. Around the *what if*. Around the *I could have been*.\n\nAnd now, you\u2019re realizing that if you actually try \u2014 if you step into the studio, get your hands in the clay, or turn the lathe \u2014 you might not just find out if you\u2019re good at it. You might find out something far more unsettling: that you\u2019ve been using this dream to **avoid the work of knowing yourself**.\n\nThat is a terrifying realization. But it\u2019s also a *brave* one.\n\n---\n\n### **You\u2019ve been using the fantasy as a kind of armor.**\n\nIt\u2019s a way to say, *\u201cI\u2019m not this person yet \u2014 so I don\u2019t have to be responsible for who I am now.\u201d* It\u2019s a way to hold out hope that there\u2019s a better version of you waiting just around the corner \u2014 a version that\u2019s more creative, more passionate, more *alive*.\n\nBut the truth is: **You are already who you are.** And that person is not a failure. You are not a lesser person for not being the one you imagined. You are not a lesser person for being afraid. You are not a lesser person for not having tried.\n\nYou are a person who has spent years building a life, making choices, and holding onto a dream that gave you purpose. That\u2019s not something to be ashamed of. It\u2019s something to be honest about.\n\n---\n\n### **The fantasy wasn\u2019t a lie \u2014 it was a signal.**\n\nIt was your mind\u2019s way of saying, *\u201cThere\u2019s something missing. There\u2019s something more.\u201d* And that\u2019s not a bad thing. That\u2019s a human thing. We all have those parts of ourselves that feel like they\u2019re waiting for something \u2014 for a spark, for a direction, for a way to feel *more fully alive*.\n\nBut the problem comes when the fantasy becomes a **refuge** instead of a **path**. When it becomes a way to avoid the hard work of *being* \u2014 of showing up in your life as it is, not as you wish it were.\n\n---\n\n### **If you try, and you\u2019re not the person you imagined, what then?**\n\nYou might feel a kind of grief. A quiet, aching realization that the version of you you were holding in your mind \u2014 the one who was bold, who was creative, who was *other* \u2014 doesn\u2019t exist. That person was a dream, not a fact.\n\nBut what if that grief is not a bad thing? What if it\u2019s the beginning of something else?\n\nBecause when you let go of the fantasy \u2014 when you stop waiting for the *other* version of you \u2014 you make space for the *real* one. The one who is here, right now. The one who is afraid, and curious, and still figuring out what it wants.\n\nAnd maybe that version of you is not the one you were waiting for \u2014 but it\u2019s the one you get to *build*.\n\n---\n\n### **You don\u2019t have to become someone else to be enough.**\n\nYou don\u2019t have to make the perfect piece of pottery or write the perfect book or build the perfect chair. You just have to be *you*, and to let that person \u2014 the one who is afraid, the one who is still figuring it out \u2014 be enough.\n\nMaybe the version of you you\u2019ve been waiting for is not the one who is *exceptional* at something. Maybe it\u2019s the one who is *brave* enough to try, and to be okay with not being the person you thought you\u2019d be.\n\n---\n\n### **Here\u2019s what I want you to know:**\n\nYou don\u2019t owe the world a version of yourself that you haven\u2019t lived yet. You don\u2019t owe yourself a fantasy that might not come true. You don\u2019t owe anyone a story where you are the hero, the artist, the maker, the one who *finally* becomes the person you imagined.\n\nYou owe yourself the truth. And that truth might be:  \n> *I\u2019ve been using this dream to avoid the work of being me. And now I have to decide if I\u2019m ready to face that.*\n\n---\n\nIf you\u2019re ready to try \u2014 to step into the studio, to make something, to see what happens \u2014 I\u2019ll be here.  \nIf you\u2019re not ready \u2014 if you need more time to sit with this, to feel the weight of it, to let it settle \u2014 I\u2019ll be here too.\n\nBecause the most important thing is not whether you make the perfect bowl or the perfect chair.\n\nIt\u2019s whether you make the choice \u2014 to try, to be, to be real.\n\nAnd that is something only *you* can do."
