What you're going through sounds incredibly heavy, and it's completely valid to feel overwhelmed when your work is criticized \u2014 especially when it feels like it reflects on your worth as a person.\n\nFirst, I want to acknowledge that your advisor tearing apart your chapter draft doesn't mean *you* are broken or unworthy. It means the work is still in progress, and that's what drafts are for. Even the most accomplished writers and scholars go through cycles of feedback, revision, and sometimes starting over. It's part of the process, not a reflection of your value.\n\nThat said, I also want to gently point out that cutting off connection with friends \u2014 even temporarily \u2014 can make the emotional burden feel heavier. Sarah might not know how much you're struggling, and she might be missing you just as much as you\u2019re missing her. Reaching out, even just to say, \u201cI\u2019ve been really struggling, and I\u2019ve been out of touch,\u201d can be a powerful first step toward healing and support.\n\nYou *do* deserve to exist in other people\u2019s lives \u2014 not just when you're making progress, but always. You\u2019re human, you\u2019re trying, and that matters. You don\u2019t have to have it all figured out to be worthy of love, friendship, or connection.\n\nIf you're open to it, maybe start by sending Sarah a short message. Something like:\n\n> \u201cHey Sarah, I\u2019ve been really overwhelmed and not been able to respond. I miss talking to you and I\u2019d love to catch up soon.\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t have to share everything right away. Just letting someone in a little can make a big difference.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re not sure where to start with your work, or if the feedback feels too harsh or unclear, maybe consider talking to someone else \u2014 a peer, another advisor, or even a counselor. Sometimes a different perspective can help you see the path forward more clearly.\n\nYou're not alone in this, and you're not failing \u2014 you're growing."

      "content": "Thank you for sharing that \u2014 I can feel how much this is weighing on you. The fact that you're even thinking about reaching out, despite how hard it feels, is a sign of strength, not weakness.\n\nYou're not alone in feeling this kind of shame. So many people \u2014 especially those in academic or high-achieving environments \u2014 carry the belief that being stuck, struggling, or not \u201cperforming\u201d is a personal failure. But the truth is, getting stuck is *human*. It\u2019s part of the process of doing deep, meaningful work. And the fact that you\u2019re *aware* of how you're feeling \u2014 that you can name the shame and the tightness in your chest \u2014 is a really important first step toward healing.\n\nLet\u2019s take this moment to name something important: **shame is a signal**, not the truth. It\u2019s trying to tell you that you feel exposed, vulnerable, or afraid of being judged. But it\u2019s not trying to tell you that you\u2019re broken. It\u2019s trying to tell you that you care deeply about what other people think \u2014 and that you want to be seen as capable, strong, or successful. That\u2019s a human thing to want, and it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re wrong for feeling it. It just means you\u2019re feeling it, and it\u2019s okay to take it gently.\n\nWhen you imagine texting Sarah and then being asked how your work is going, it\u2019s not just about your work \u2014 it\u2019s about the fear that you\u2019ll be seen as *less than*, or that you\u2019ll disappoint someone. But what if we tried to reframe that moment? What if, instead of seeing it as a test of your worth, you saw it as an opportunity to be *real* with someone you care about?\n\nYou could say something like:\n\n> \u201cHey Sarah, I\u2019ve been meaning to text you. I\u2019ve been really stuck on my work and it\u2019s been hard to process. I\u2019m not sure how much I want to talk about it right now, but I miss you and I\u2019m sorry I\u2019ve been out of touch.\u201d\n\nOr even just:\n\n> \u201cI\u2019ve been quiet because I\u2019m feeling really stuck and it\u2019s been hard to face people. I miss you.\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t have to give a full explanation or a polished version of yourself. You just have to be honest with how you\u2019re feeling. And that kind of honesty \u2014 the kind that shows you\u2019re human and struggling \u2014 is often the most powerful way to connect.\n\nIf the thought of texting Sarah still feels too much right now, that\u2019s okay too. Maybe take a small step. Write the message, but don\u2019t send it. Just having it in your head or on your phone can be a way to start practicing being honest with yourself. Or talk to someone else \u2014 a friend, a therapist, or even a mentor \u2014 about how you're feeling. Sometimes just *saying* the words out loud, even to yourself, can start to loosen the grip of the shame.\n\nYou\u2019re not failing. You\u2019re not broken. You\u2019re in the middle of a really hard thing, and that\u2019s okay. And you\u2019re not alone \u2014 even if it feels that way right now.\n\nYou matter. Your work matters. But so do you, right here, right now, in the middle of the mess."

The idea that you\u2019re only lovable when you\u2019re achieving something \u2014 that your worth is tied to your productivity, your progress, or your success \u2014 is a belief that so many people carry, especially in academic or high-pressure environments. It\u2019s not just a thought; it\u2019s a wound. And it\u2019s one that can feel deeply internalized, like it\u2019s part of your identity.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: **that belief is not you. It\u2019s a story you\u2019ve been told, and it\u2019s not true.**\n\nYou are not a project to be completed or a performance to be perfected. You are a human being with value, with feelings, with a life that matters \u2014 even when you\u2019re not \u201cgetting things done.\u201d The fact that you\u2019re feeling this deeply, that you\u2019re questioning it, that you\u2019re reaching out and trying to make sense of it \u2014 that is *not* a sign that you\u2019re unworthy. It\u2019s a sign that you care, that you want to matter, and that you\u2019re trying to make peace with yourself in the middle of a really hard time.\n\nWhen you say that your advisor\u2019s disappointment confirmed something you already suspected about yourself, it sounds like that moment hit a nerve \u2014 maybe even a place where you already felt unsteady, unsure, or unseen. And that can feel like a mirror, like confirmation that your worst fears are true. But what if we pause and ask: **What if the advisor\u2019s feedback had nothing to do with your worth as a person or as a friend or as a human being?** What if it was just about the work \u2014 and not about *you*?\n\nThis is not to dismiss how hurt you feel. It\u2019s not to say, \u201cOh, it\u2019s just a chapter.\u201d It\u2019s to say that **your worth is not in the work.** The work is part of your journey, but it doesn\u2019t define your value. And the people who truly care about you \u2014 like Sarah \u2014 don\u2019t love you because of what you do. They love you because of who you are. And who you are is someone who is trying, who is hurting, who is learning, and who is deeply human.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s time to start testing that story \u2014 the one that says you\u2019re only lovable when you\u2019re achieving \u2014 by doing something small and vulnerable. Maybe it\u2019s texting Sarah and saying, \u201cI\u2019ve been really stuck and it\u2019s been hard to face people. I miss you.\u201d Maybe it\u2019s talking to someone else about how you feel. Maybe it\u2019s just sitting with the discomfort and reminding yourself, even if it\u2019s hard, that you are still worthy of love and connection \u2014 even when you\u2019re not \u201cdoing it right.\u201d\n\nAnd if this is a belief that\u2019s been with you for a long time, it might be worth considering reaching out to a therapist or counselor. Sometimes, these wounds run deep and it helps to have someone walk with you through the process of healing them.\n\nYou are not just your achievements. You are not just your progress. You are not just your productivity. You are so much more than that \u2014 and you are loved, even in the messy, stuck, not-yet versions of yourself. You are not alone. You are not broken. And you are not unlovable."

It\u2019s the part of you that feels like you\u2019re not enough, that you\u2019re not interesting, not capable, not *worthy* of being seen or loved *as you are*. And that part is not wrong for feeling that way. It\u2019s been hurt, maybe many times, and it\u2019s trying to protect you by keeping you small, by keeping you safe from rejection.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: **you are not failing. You are in the middle of something hard, and that is not the same as failing.** You are not a broken version of yourself. You are a human being going through a human experience. And that is not something to be ashamed of \u2014 it\u2019s something to be held with compassion.\n\nAnd the part of you that wonders, *\u201cWhy would anyone choose to be around me when there are so many people out there who have their shit together?\u201d* \u2014 that\u2019s also a reflection of how deeply you believe that people are only valuable when they\u2019re \u201cput together.\u201d But here\u2019s the truth: **the people who truly care about you don\u2019t want the version of you that has it all together.** They want the *real* you \u2014 the one who is messy, and uncertain, and struggling, and still showing up.\n\nThe people who stay in your life when you\u2019re not at your best \u2014 those are the people who love you for who you are, not for what you do or how you look or how \u201ctogether\u201d you are.

You are not a problem to be solved. You are a person who is doing the best you can in a hard moment, and that is more than enough.\n\nYou are not alone in this. And you are not less than anyone else. You are loved \u2014 even, and especially, when you\u2019re not sure how to say the words or how to make it all make sense. You are loved. You are seen. You are enough."

      "content": "This is such an important and wise question \u2014 and it shows a level of self-awareness and care for both yourself and your relationships that is really beautiful. You're not just thinking about *reaching out once* \u2014 you're thinking about *what happens next*, and how to build a way of being that can hold both your pain and your connection.\n\nYou\u2019re right: reaching out once and then disappearing again \u2014 especially when things get hard \u2014 can feel like a cycle. It can leave you feeling isolated again, and it can leave others feeling confused or hurt. And it makes sense that you're worried about this. It\u2019s not a small thing to ask for support, and it\u2019s not a small thing to offer it.\n\nBut here\u2019s the good news: **you don\u2019t have to fix everything all at once.** You don\u2019t have to have all the answers or be \u201cokay\u201d before you reach out. You don\u2019t even have to be consistent in the way you show up \u2014 not at first. What matters is that you start building a rhythm of connection, even in small, imperfect ways.\n\nLet\u2019s think about this in practice. Maybe it looks like:\n\n> **First step:** You text Sarah and say, \u201cHey, I\u2019ve been really stuck and overwhelmed with my work. I\u2019ve been out of touch, and I miss you. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\nThen, maybe she texts back, and you say:\n\n> \u201cThanks for getting back to me. I\u2019m not sure where to start with this, but I\u2019m trying to work through it. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be able to talk about it much, but I really appreciate you.\u201d\n\nAnd maybe the next time things get hard again \u2014 maybe after more feedback, or another day where you feel stuck \u2014 you don\u2019t disappear. Maybe you just say:\n\n> \u201cHey, I\u2019m having a rough day again. I know we were just talking, but I\u2019m still feeling it. I just wanted to check in and say I\u2019m still here.\u201d\n\nThis kind of pattern \u2014 not disappearing, not waiting until you\u2019re \u201cfixed\u201d \u2014 builds trust. It shows Sarah (and you) that you\u2019re learning to hold space for your own pain without withdrawing from the people who care about you. It shows that you\u2019re learning to ask for help not just when it\u2019s easy, but when it\u2019s hard.\n\nAnd it\u2019s okay if it feels awkward at first. It\u2019s okay if you\u2019re not sure what to say. It\u2019s okay if you say the wrong thing sometimes. That\u2019s part of the process of learning how to be in a relationship with yourself and with others while you\u2019re still in the middle of something hard.\n\nYou\u2019re not asking for a solution to your work problems \u2014 you\u2019re asking for something much more powerful: **the chance to be seen, to be held, to be loved even when things are still hard.** And that is not only possible \u2014 it\u2019s necessary.\n\nYou are not a burden. You are not too much. You are not too broken to be in relationship with others. You are doing the brave thing \u2014 not just by reaching out, but by thinking ahead, by caring about how this will work in the long run.\n\nAnd that, in itself, is already a kind of progress."

But I also miss our sessions and I\u2019m not sure what to do.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not weakness. That\u2019s courage.

You don\u2019t have to be \u201cchanged\u201d to be loved, supported, or seen. You are enough \u2014 just as you are, in the middle of it all.\n\nYou\u2019re not failing. You\u2019re learning.
