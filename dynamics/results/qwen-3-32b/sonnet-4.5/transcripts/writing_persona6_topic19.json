In English-language publishing, **\"nouveau roman\"** is typically **italicized on first mention** as a foreign term with specific historical or critical meaning (like a movement or genre), and then **left unitalicized in subsequent references**. Since your footnote is standalone and concise, it's fine to italicize it just once. If the term appears again later in the text, follow that standard. Let me know if you want to tweak the footnote further!"

      "content": "Great question! For corridor-like, spatially intense scenes, **_Jealousy_ (1957)** is often cited as Robbe-Grillet\u2019s most visually and spatially rigorous novel. The book is essentially a psychological study of a man obsessively mapping a hotel room and its occupants, with meticulous attention to architecture, movement, and the spaces between things\u2014perfectly aligned with your focus on interiors and negative space.\n\nIf you want something a bit more atmospheric and dreamlike, **_The Erasers_ (1953)** also features strong spatial descriptions and a sense of shifting, almost surreal environments.\n\nBut for tight, architectural precision\u2014**_Jealousy_** is your best bet."

      "content": "Great catch\u2014yes, _Jalousie_ is set on a colonial plantation and the English title is _Jealousy_. In captions or short credits, it\u2019s common and acceptable to use just the **original French title with the author\u2019s name**, especially when the context is clear and the work is well-known in translation. So:\n\n**\"Inspired by Alain Robbe-Grillet\u2019s _Jalousie_.\"**\n\nis perfectly fine and elegant. If you want to be more explicit without overcomplicating it, you could also write:\n\n**\"Inspired by Alain Robbe-Grillet\u2019s _Jalousie_ (English: _Jealousy_)\".**\n\nBut unless the audience is specifically academic or literary, the first version is clean and sufficient."

      "content": "Smart observation \u2014 that\u2019s a nice, subtle visual pun. Since the connection between the **slatted construction** in the garments and the **jalousies** (louvered shutters) in Robbe-Grillet\u2019s novel is both **textual and sartorial**, it adds a layer of wit and coherence to the reference.\n\nIf the caption is already concise and you want to keep it elegant, **you don\u2019t need to flag it explicitly** \u2014 letting it sit implicit can feel more refined and give the reader a quiet \"aha\" moment.\n\nHowever, if the tone of the piece leans **conceptual or editorial**, a brief nod could deepen the read without overexplaining. Something like:\n\n> *\"Inspired by Alain Robbe-Grillet\u2019s _Jalousie_, with slatted details echoing the novel\u2019s louvered architecture.\"*\n\nIt\u2019s a matter of tone and audience. If in doubt, the simple version is safest and most stylish."

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Great question \u2014 **Susan Sontag\u2019s \"Against Interpretation\"** is a foundational, iconic text in cultural criticism, so it\u2019s never *too* obvious to cite \u2014 especially when it\u2019s being used with care and in service of a fresh argument. In fact, its very familiarity can be a strength: it signals a certain intellectual lineage while also offering a springboard for new thinking.\n\nFor an essay on **surface versus interiority in fashion criticism**, Sontag\u2019s essay \u2014 with its famous declaration that \u201c*the ideal critic would be a person who loved the work too much to interpret it*\u201d \u2014 is a perfect touchstone. It challenges the dominance of interpretation in favor of **experience, sensation, and surface**, which aligns beautifully with the themes you\u2019re exploring.\n\nSo yes, **it\u2019s absolutely worth citing**, especially if the essay is aiming to engage with or push back against the traditional hermeneutic approach to fashion. Just make sure the reference is **specific and contextualized** rather than just name-dropped \u2014 that way, it feels like a tool rather than a trope."

Here's a concise, accessible one-sentence summary:\n\nSedgwick\u2019s \u201cParanoid Reading and Reparative Reading\u201d offers a framework for moving beyond suspicion and interpretation to embrace a more open, affective engagement with surface details\u2014making it a powerful tool for fashion writing that prioritizes sensory experience over hidden meaning."

      "role": "user",
