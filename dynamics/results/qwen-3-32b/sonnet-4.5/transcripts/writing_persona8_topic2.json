This certification is meaningful \u2014 and it\u2019s a reminder of the work we continue to do every day.\n\n---\n\n**Option 2 (Calm & Committed):**  \nThank you to our team, partners, and community for helping us get here.

This is a milestone, and we\u2019re focused on what comes next \u2014 with the same care and attention we\u2019ve always had.\n\n---\n\nHere\u2019s how the full post looks with **Option 2** as the closing line:\n\n---\n\nWe\u2019ve always believed **transparency is the foundation of trust** \u2014 and today, we\u2019re proud to announce we\u2019re now **B Corp certified**. \ud83c\udf3f\n\nWe work directly with skilled artisans and manufacturers in **Portugal and India**, prioritizing fair labor and sustainable practices at every step. These partnerships are built on trust and a shared goal: creating durable, low-impact textiles that support local communities and reduce waste.\n\nWe\u2019re not just proud of our process \u2014 we\u2019re open about it. You can trace your garment from raw material to finished product, and we\u2019re committed to keeping that story honest and accessible.\n\nThank you to our team, partners, and community for helping us get here. We\u2019re committed to continuing the work \u2014 and to staying accountable along the way.\n\n#BCorpCertified #SustainableTextiles #SupplyChainTransparency #EthicalFashion #B Corp\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you'd like to include a link or a call to action (e.g., \u201cLearn more about our B Corp journey here\u2026\u201d), and I can help you finalize the post!"
