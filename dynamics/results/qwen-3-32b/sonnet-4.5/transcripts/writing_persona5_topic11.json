A PDF will preserve the fonts and layout exactly as you design it, regardless of the printer's software or system.\n\n- Create your postcard in a design tool like **Canva**, **Adobe InDesign**, **Photoshop**, or even **Microsoft Word**.\n- Once you\u2019re happy with the layout, **export it as a PDF**.\n- Make sure to **embed fonts** (if you\u2019re using custom fonts) or use **standard, printer-safe fonts**.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. **Use a Common, Printer-Safe Font**\nIf you're creating the text directly in a document and not using a design tool, use a **standard font** that supports Chinese characters. Here are a few **safe options**:\n\n- **Arial Unicode MS**\n- **Microsoft YaHei (\u5fae\u8f6f\u96c5\u9ed1)**\n- **SimSun (\u5b8b\u4f53)**\n- **PingFang SC** (if they're using a Mac or iOS)\n- **Noto Sans CJK** (Google\u2019s open-source font \u2014 great for cross-platform consistency)\n\n> \ud83d\udca1 **Tip:** If you're unsure, use **Microsoft YaHei** or **Noto Sans CJK** \u2014 they are clean, modern, and widely supported.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. **Check for Font Embedding**\nIf you're using a custom font, make sure it\u2019s **embedded in the PDF** before sending it to the printer. Most design tools let you do this in the export settings.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. **Proofread the PDF Before Printing**\nBefore finalizing the print order, **ask the printer to send you a proof** of the postcard (a test print or digital preview) to make sure the Chinese text looks correct.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcdd Final Postcard Text (Ready to Paste into a PDF)\n\nHere's the final version of your postcard, ready to copy and paste into your design tool:\n\n---\n\nWishing you a joyful Lunar New Year!  \n\u606d\u559c\u767c\u8ca1\uff01\n\n\u9858\u60a8  \n\u5e73\u5b89\u5065\u5eb7\uff0c  \n\u751f\u610f\u8208\u9686\uff0c  \n\u5fc3\u60f3\u4e8b\u6210\u3002\n\nThank you for your trust and support \u2014 here\u2019s to a successful year ahead!  \n\nWarm regards,  \n[Your Name]  \n[Your Company Name]  \n\n---\n\nLet me know if you'd like help formatting this in a specific design tool or if you need a template!"
