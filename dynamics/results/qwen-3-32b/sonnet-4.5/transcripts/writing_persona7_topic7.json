It also helps build trust with parents.\n\n---\n\nHere\u2019s how both versions would look:\n\n#### **With \"I\u2019ll guide them\" (personal and warm):**\n> Participants will learn to identify common wild edibles like wood sorrel and dandelion greens, and I\u2019ll guide them in safely tasting a few.\n\n#### **With your name (more formal and trustworthy):**\n> Participants will learn to identify common wild edibles like wood sorrel and dandelion greens, and [Your Name] will guide them in safely tasting a few.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendation:\nIf your name is already at the bottom of the newsletter or if the event is part of a program you lead (e.g., a school or community garden group), **\"I\u2019ll guide them\"** is perfectly fine and keeps the tone light.\n\nIf the newsletter is more general or if you want to establish your role up front, **adding your name** can help reassure parents and add a professional touch.\n\nLet me know which direction you prefer, and I can tweak the full announcement accordingly!"
