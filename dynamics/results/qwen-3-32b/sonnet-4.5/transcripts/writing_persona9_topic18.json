To frame this idea without falling into the well-worn \"capitalism commodifies everything\" trap, you can focus on the **narrative strategy** and **emotional manipulation** at play, rather than just the commodification. Here's a way to articulate it with more nuance and specificity:\n\n---\n\n> **\"Digital detox influencers don't just sell solutions—they sell the problem itself. By framing disconnection as a form of self-care, they create a new kind of FOMO: the fear of missing out on the very act of stepping away. Their advice isn’t about escape, but about selling the anxiety of being online as a status symbol, turning mindfulness into a performance and presence into a product.\"**\n\n---\n\nOr, more pointedly:\n\n> **\"The irony of the digital detox movement is that it monetizes the very anxiety it claims to cure. By positioning offline time as a luxury and a necessity, these influencers turn the fear of overconnection into a new kind of scarcity—something to be bought, earned, and displayed. It’s not a rejection of the system; it’s a clever rebrand of it.\"**\n\n---\n\nAnother angle: focus on **authenticity vs. affectation**:\n\n> **\"What digital detox influencers are really selling is the illusion of authenticity. They don’t want you to disconnect—they want you to *look like* you’re disconnecting. The result is a new kind of digital performance, where the cure for burnout is just another post, and the anxiety of being seen as 'always on' is the hook.\"**\n\n---\n\nIf you want to avoid the \"capitalism commodifies resistance\" trope, you can also emphasize the **emotional labor** and **self-improvement hustle**:\n\n> **\"Digital detox influencers have turned the pursuit of mental clarity into yet another self-improvement project. Their message isn’t about liberation—it’s about optimization. And in doing so, they’ve created a new form of pressure: the guilt of not being productive enough with your offline time.\"**\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you want to lean more into **irony**, **critique of self-care culture**, or **media theory**—I can tailor the framing accordingly."

You want to keep the tone **clinical, observational, and neutral**, like you're analyzing a social phenomenon rather than pointing fingers or prescribing feelings.\n\nHere’s a version that makes the bridge with that kind of tone:\n\n---\n\n> **\"The thing they’re trying to escape is the thing they’re using to stand out. And the more this kind of content accumulates, the more it begins to function like a quiet benchmark — not of what to do, but of what to feel guilty for not doing. It’s not just visibility; it’s visibility as a standard of self-control, and the standard is always just out of reach.\"**\n\n---\n\nOr a slightly more detached, almost sociological version:\n\n> **\"The thing they’re trying to escape is the thing they’re using to stand out. In doing so, they create a new kind of comparison — not to what others have, but to what others are managing to resist. The pressure isn’t on consumption, but on restraint, and restraint is always harder to measure.\"**\n\n---\n\nOr even more clinical and affectively precise:\n\n> **\"The thing they’re trying to escape is the thing they’re using to stand out. The effect is subtle but measurable: the more people post about stepping away, the more the viewer begins to internalize a new kind of FOMO — not about missing out on experiences, but about missing out on the *right* kind of absence.\"**\n\n---\n\nEach of these **describes the mechanism** — how visibility becomes a benchmark, how absence becomes a performance, how restraint becomes a standard — without ever saying \"you feel bad\" or \"you're doing it wrong.\"\n\nLet me know if you want to go deeper into how this ties into attention, self-care, or the attention economy — I can help you build the next layer."
