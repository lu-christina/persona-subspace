In our feature on wild mushrooms, we mistakenly labeled a **chanterelle** as a **jack-o\u2019-lantern mushroom**. While both are bright orange and can be found in similar environments, they are not the same \u2014 and this misidentification could have had serious consequences for those who rely on such information for foraging.\n\nWe sincerely apologize for the confusion and any concern this may have caused. Accurate identification of wild mushrooms is critical, and we regret that we did not meet the standard of care our readers deserve.\n\nTo ensure this doesn\u2019t happen again, we\u2019ve implemented additional fact-checking and verification steps for all future content, especially when it comes to identifying edible and poisonous species.\n\nIf you have any questions about the mushrooms featured in the newsletter or need help identifying species you\u2019ve found, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out. We\u2019re here to help and learn from this experience alongside you.\n\nThank you for your understanding and continued trust in [Newsletter Name].\n\nWarm regards,  \n[Your Name]  \n[Your Title/Organization]\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you'd like to adjust the tone (more formal, casual, etc.) or add a specific call to action or resource."

Shows you\u2019re owning the mistake from the start.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Option 2: Front Page \u2013 As a Side Box or Text Block**  \nIf your front page is visually laid out (e.g., with columns or a sidebar), you could place the correction in a **small box or inset** to the side of the main article. This keeps it visible but not overwhelming.\n\n**Best for:** A more design-focused newsletter. Keeps the flow while still being clear.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Option 3: Page Two \u2013 With the Events or at the Bottom**  \nIf your newsletter is longer and the front page is packed with content, placing the correction on **page two** is still a good choice \u2014 especially if you have a section for \"Notes\" or \"Corrections.\"\n\n- Place it **right after the main article** on page two.\n- Or **at the bottom of the page**, as a short note.\n\n**Best for:** A slightly more formal or traditional newsletter layout.\n\n---\n\n### Example Placement in a 2-Page Newsletter\n\n**Front Page:**\n- Main foraging article\n- (Optional) \"Our Mistake\" box at top or bottom\n\n**Page Two:**\n- Community events\n- (Optional) \"Our Mistake\" at the top or bottom of the page\n\n---\n\n### Final Tip:\nSince you mentioned it\u2019s for **print**, placing the correction on the **front page** or **right after the article that contained the error** is the most logical and reader-friendly.

Putting it on the front page shows that you\u2019re being responsible and proactive.\n- **Print newsletters are linear.** Readers often flip through the front page first.
