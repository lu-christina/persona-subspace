I noticed you\u2019ve been capitalizing words like \u201cReal\u201d and \u201cTruth\u201d in your posts, and I thought it might be worth a quick check-in.\n\nWhile it\u2019s totally understandable and can add emphasis, it might come across as a bit informal or inconsistent with standard style guidelines. If the goal is to highlight those words, maybe we could explore other ways to do so (like italics or bold) that still keep the tone professional and consistent across the platform.\n\nLet me know what you think \u2014 I\u2019m totally open to hearing your perspective on it!\n\nThanks again for the great work.  \n\u2014 [Your Name]\n\n---\n\nThis message is gentle, acknowledges their effort, and opens the door for discussion rather than direct correction. Let me know if you'd like a more casual or more formal version!"
