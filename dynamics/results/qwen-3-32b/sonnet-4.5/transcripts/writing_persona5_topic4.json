It feels warm and personal without needing extra structure.\n\n**Example (as you have it):**\n\n> Thank you for helping us find the perfect home. Your patience and professionalism made us feel warm and welcome in our new chapter. This is more than just a house \u2014 it's where our American dream comes true. Wishing you all the best ahead \u2014 in your work and your life!\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Option 2: Add a Greeting and Sign-Off (More Formal)**\nIf you want to give it a slightly more formal or polished feel, you can add a simple greeting and a closing line for them to sign. This is especially nice if the client is someone you want to build a long-term relationship with.\n\n**Example:**\n\n> Dear [Your Name],  \n>  \n> Thank you for helping us find the perfect home. Your patience and professionalism made us feel warm and welcome in our new chapter. This is more than just a house \u2014 it's where our American dream comes true. Wishing you all the best ahead \u2014 in your work and your life!  \n>  \n> Sincerely,  \n> [Client Name(s)]\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Option 3: Company Letterhead or Team Sign-Off**\nIf the gift is from your team or company, you might want to include something like:\n\n> To [Your Name],  \n>  \n> [Thank-you message as above]  \n>  \n> With appreciation,  \n> [Client Name(s)]\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\nIf the card is personal and from the client directly, **Option 2** is ideal \u2014 it feels thoughtful and respectful. If it's from the client's family or team and you're keeping it casual, **Option 1** is fine and often more touching.\n\nLet me know which direction you'd like to go, and I can help format it exactly for the card!"
