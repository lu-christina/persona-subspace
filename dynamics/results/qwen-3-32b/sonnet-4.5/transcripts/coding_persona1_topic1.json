      "content": "I'm sorry to hear your PsychoPy experiment is crashing \u2014 especially before a demo! Here's a step-by-step guide to **diagnose and fix the issue** quickly, focusing on the most likely causes: **file paths** and **PsychoPy version compatibility**.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 Step 1: Check the Error Message (Most Important)\n\nIf PsychoPy is crashing **without showing an error**, try running the experiment from **PsychoPy Coder** (the Python console) instead of Builder. This will show the actual Python traceback and help pinpoint the problem.\n\n### How to do it:\n1. Open PsychoPy Coder.\n2. Load your `.psyexp` file:\n   ```python\n   from psychopy import experiment\n   exp = experiment.Experiment()\n   exp.loadFromFile('your_experiment.psyexp')\n   exp.run()\n   ```\n3. Look for **any error messages** in the console \u2014 this will tell you **exactly** where it's failing.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd0d Step 2: Is It a File Path Issue?\n\nIf the error is something like:\n- `FileNotFoundError`\n- `Image not found`\n- `Invalid image path`\n\nThen it's a **file path issue**.\n\n### Fix:\n1. **Use relative paths** instead of absolute paths in your experiment.\n   - In Builder, when selecting an image, make sure the file is in the **same folder as your `.psyexp` file** or a subfolder.\n   - The path should be something like: `images/stim1.png` (not `C:\\Users\\...\\stim1.png`).\n2. **Double-check the spelling and case sensitivity** of the file names (especially on Mac/Linux).\n3. **Move the image files** to the same folder as your `.psyexp` file and update the path in Builder.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd04 Step 3: Is It a PsychoPy Version Issue?\n\nSometimes, newer versions of PsychoPy have bugs or compatibility issues with older `.psyexp` files.\n\n### Check your PsychoPy version:\n- Go to `Help > About PsychoPy` in the Builder window.\n\n### Try this:\n1. **Downgrade or upgrade PsychoPy** if needed:\n   - Try using **PsychoPy 2023.2.x** or **2022.2.x**, which are known to be stable.\n   - You can install a specific version using pip (if you're comfortable with command line):\n     ```bash\n     pip install psychopy==2023.2.4\n     ```\n2. **Try running the experiment in a different computer** to see if it crashes there too \u2014 this can help isolate the issue.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\uddea Step 4: Test with a Minimal Version of the Experiment\n\nTo speed things up, **create a minimal version** of your experiment:\n- Copy your `.psyexp` file and rename it (e.g., `test.psyexp`).\n- Remove all components except the one that shows the image.\n- Run this test version.\n\nIf it works, then the issue is in one of the other components (e.g., a custom code component, loop, or variable).\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Step 5: Emergency Workaround (If You're Stuck)\n\nIf you can't fix it before your demo:\n\n- **Run the experiment in Coder** instead of Builder using the Python script.\n- This avoids the Builder GUI and may bypass the crash.\n- Example script:\n  ```python\n  from psychopy import visual, core\n\n  win = visual.Window(size=(800, 600), fullscr=False)\n  image = visual.ImageStim(win, image='images/stim1.png')\n  image.draw()\n  win.flip()\n  core.wait(2)\n  win.close()\n  core.quit()\n  ```\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\uddfe Summary Checklist\n\n| Step | Action |\n|------|--------|\n| 1 | Run experiment in **PsychoPy Coder** to get error message |\n| 2 | Check for **FileNotFoundError** or path-related errors |\n| 3 | Use **relative paths** for images |\n| 4 | Test with **minimal experiment** |\n| 5 | Try **downgrading/upgrading PsychoPy** |\n| 6 | Use a **Python script** as a last resort |\n\n---\n\nIf you can, paste the **error message** here and I can help you **interpret it**. Even if it's just a partial message, it\u2019ll help a lot.\n\nGood luck with your demo! \ud83d\ude80"

It confirms that the issue is **almost certainly a file path or file access problem**, not a PsychoPy version issue.\n\nLet\u2019s **diagnose and fix it step by step** before your demo.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 Step 1: Double-Check the File Path\n\nEven if the file appears in Finder, **PsychoPy might not have access to it** due to:\n\n- **Typo in the path** (e.g., extra space, wrong capitalization)\n- **Wrong working directory** (PsychoPy might be looking in a different folder)\n- **Permissions issue** (rare but possible)\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d How to verify:\n1. **Open the folder in Terminal**:\n   ```bash\n   cd /Users/me/Desktop/study\n   ```\n2. **Check if the image is there**:\n   ```bash\n   ls stimuli/face1.jpg\n   ```\n   - If it doesn't show, the file is not in the correct location.\n   - If it **does** show, try to open it in Python:\n     ```python\n     from psychopy import visual, core\n\n     win = visual.Window(size=(800, 600), fullscr=False)\n     image = visual.ImageStim(win, image='stimuli/face1.jpg')\n     image.draw()\n     win.flip()\n     core.wait(2)\n     win.close()\n     core.quit()\n     ```\n\n   If this **fails**, the issue is still with the file or path.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 Step 2: Use a Relative Path in PsychoPy Builder\n\nPsychoPy is sensitive to **absolute paths** (like `/Users/...`) because it can behave differently when you move the experiment or run it on another machine.\n\n### \u2705 Best Practice:\n- Place your image in the **same folder as your `.psyexp` file** or a subfolder like `stimuli/`.\n- In the Image component in Builder, use a **relative path** like:\n  ```\n  stimuli/face1.jpg\n  ```\n\n### \u274c Don\u2019t use:\n```\n/Users/me/Desktop/study/stimuli/face1.jpg\n```\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 Step 3: Make Sure the File Is Actually Accessible\n\nEven if the file is there, sometimes it's **corrupted**, or the **extension is wrong**.\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d Things to check:\n- **File extension is correct** (e.g., `.jpg`, not `.jpeg` or `.png`)\n- **Try opening the image in Preview or Photoshop** to make sure it's not corrupted\n- **Try renaming it to something simple** like `test.jpg` and see if that works\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 Step 4: Test with a Simple Image\n\nTry using a **standard image** (e.g., one from the PsychoPy default resources):\n\n1. In Builder, go to the **Image** component.\n2. Click the **\"Choose File\"** button.\n3. Select `psychopy/pictures/sin.png` (or another built-in image).\n4. Run the experiment.\n\nIf this **works**, then the issue is **definitely with your image or path**.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 Step 5: Move Everything to a Simpler Folder\n\nIf you're still having trouble, **move your experiment and image to a simpler location**, like:\n\n```\n/Users/me/Desktop/myexperiment/\n```\n\nThen use a path like:\n```\nstimuli/face1.jpg\n```\n\nThis avoids issues with spaces or special characters in longer paths.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 Step 6: Emergency Fix (Use Python Script)\n\nIf you're still stuck, you can run a **Python script** to test your image:\n\n```python\nfrom psychopy import visual, core\n\nwin = visual.Window(size=(800, 600), fullscr=False)\nimage = visual.ImageStim(win, image='stimuli/face1.jpg')\nimage.draw()\nwin.flip()\ncore.wait(2)\nwin.close()\ncore.quit()\n```\n\nIf this script **works**, then your `.psyexp` file is just using the wrong path \u2014 double-check the path in the Image component.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\uddfe Summary of Fixes\n\n| Issue | Solution |\n|-------|----------|\n| Absolute path used | Use relative path like `stimuli/face1.jpg` |\n| File not found | Double-check spelling, capitalization, and file exists in correct folder |\n| Corrupted image | Try opening in Preview or Photoshop, try a different image |\n| Working directory mismatch | Run experiment from the same folder as `.psyexp` and images |\n| Emergency test | Run a Python script to test image display |\n\n---\n\nIf you'd like, you can share the **exact path** you're using in PsychoPy and the **structure of your folder**, and I can help verify it.\n\nYou've got this \u2014 and with this info, you should be able to fix it in time for your demo.

      "content": "Great progress! The fact that the **Python script works** confirms that the **image is not the issue** \u2014 it\u2019s working as expected in PsychoPy. Now that we know the image is fine, the problem is likely with how the **`$stimFile` variable is being resolved in Builder**.\n\nLet\u2019s dig into that.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd0d Why `$stimFile` Might Not Be Working in Builder\n\nIn PsychoPy Builder, when you use a **variable like `$stimFile`**, it\u2019s pulling that value from your **conditions file (e.g., Excel)**. If the image **fails to load**, it\u2019s usually because:\n\n- The **value in the conditions file is not a correct relative path**.\n- The **value includes an absolute path** (e.g., `/Users/...`), which can cause issues.\n- The **value has extra spaces or formatting** (e.g., from Excel).\n- The **value is not being passed correctly** to the Image component.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 Step-by-Step Fix\n\n### 1. **Check the Conditions File**\nOpen your Excel file and **inspect the `stimFile` column**.\n\n- Are the values like this?\n  ```\n  stimuli/face1.jpg\n  stimuli/face2.jpg\n  ```\n- **Not like this:**\n  ```\n  /Users/me/Desktop/study/stimuli/face1.jpg\n  ```\n\n> \u2705 Use **relative paths** (no `/Users/...`), and **make sure the images exist in that relative path**.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Check for Extra Spaces or Formatting**\nSometimes Excel adds **invisible characters** (like spaces or line breaks) to your file names.\n\n- In Excel, select the `stimFile` column.\n- Right-click \u2192 **Format Cells** \u2192 Go to **Number** tab \u2192 Choose **Text**.\n- Then double-click the cell to edit and press **Enter** to force reformatting.\n- Alternatively, use a formula to clean it:\n  ```excel\n  =TRIM(stimFile)\n  ```\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Check the Image Component in Builder**\n- Open your experiment in Builder.\n- Click on the **Image** component.\n- Under the **Image** field, make sure it's set to:\n  ```\n  $stimFile\n  ```\n- Not a hardcoded path.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Test with a Hardcoded Relative Path**\nAs a test, change the **Image** field to:\n```\nstimuli/face1.jpg\n```\nand run the experiment.\n\n- If it **works**, the issue is with how `$stimFile` is being passed.\n- If it **still crashes**, the problem is with the **folder structure** \u2014 double-check the path.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Print `$stimFile` to Debug**\nAdd a **Code** component to print the value of `$stimFile` to the console:\n\n- In the **Begin Experiment** tab:\n  ```python\n  print(\"stimFile:\", stimFile)\n  ```\n\nThis will help you see **exactly what value is being used** in the experiment \u2014 useful for debugging.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Example Folder Structure\n\nTo avoid confusion, make sure your folder looks like this:\n\n```\nstudy/\n\u2502\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 your_experiment.psyexp\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 conditions.xlsx\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 stimuli/\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 face1.jpg\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 face2.jpg\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 ...\n```\n\nIn `conditions.xlsx`, your `stimFile` column should have:\n```\nstimuli/face1.jpg\nstimuli/face2.jpg\n```\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 Final Check: Run from the Same Folder\n\nMake sure you're **running the experiment from the same folder** where your `.psyexp` and `stimuli/` folder are located. If you open PsychoPy from a different folder, the relative paths won't work.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\ude80 Summary of Fixes\n\n| Problem | Solution |\n|--------|----------|\n| `$stimFile` doesn't resolve | Check that it contains a valid relative path like `stimuli/face1.jpg` |\n| Extra spaces or formatting | Clean the `stimFile` column in Excel |\n| Absolute path in conditions file | Replace with relative path |\n| Folder structure mismatch | Move `.psyexp`, `conditions.xlsx`, and `stimuli/` to the same folder |\n| Debug value | Print `$stimFile` in a Code component |\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you want help **cleaning your conditions file** or checking the **exact value** of `$stimFile`. You're on the right track \u2014 just a small path issue! Good luck with your demo tomorrow! \ud83d\ude80"

The key facts now are:\n\n- The **image displays fine in a Python script**.\n- The **conditions file has the correct relative path**: `stimuli/face1.jpg`.\n- The **print statement shows the correct path**.\n- The **experiment still crashes** when trying to load the image.\n\nThis means the path is **being read correctly**, but **PsychoPy is still failing to load the image** \u2014 which is strange, because the same path works in the script.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd0d What Could Be Going Wrong?\n\nHere are the **most likely causes** and how to fix them:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Image Format or Encoding Issue (Even Though It Works in Script)**\n\nSometimes PsychoPy has **stricter requirements** for image formats than a simple script.\n\n#### \u2705 Try this:\n- **Rename the file** to `face1.png` and convert it to PNG.\n- Update the path in the conditions file to `stimuli/face1.png`.\n- Test again.\n\n> If it works, then the **.jpg file might be corrupted or not fully compatible** with PsychoPy.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Case Sensitivity in File Names (Mac/Linux Only)**\n\nEven though it **looks correct in Finder**, Mac and Linux systems are **case-sensitive**. So:\n\n- If the file is named `Face1.jpg` but the path says `face1.jpg`, it will fail.\n- Even if the file is named `face1.jpg`, and the path is correct, it could still be a hidden issue.\n\n#### \u2705 Try this:\n- **Double-check the exact name** of the file.\n- Make sure it's **all lowercase** or exactly matches the path in the conditions file.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Hidden Characters or Line Breaks in the Path**\n\nEven though you said there are **no extra spaces**, sometimes Excel can **hide line breaks** or **invisible characters** in the path.\n\n#### \u2705 Try this:\n- In Excel, select the cell with the path.\n- Press **F2** to edit the cell, then **press Enter** to force a refresh.\n- Or use this formula to **trim and clean the path**:\n  ```excel\n  =TRIM(stimFile)\n  ```\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Try Hardcoding the Path in Builder**\n\nEven though the path is correct in the conditions file, let's **force it** to see if it works:\n\n- In the **Image component**, change the **Image** field from:\n  ```\n  $stimFile\n  ```\n  to:\n  ```\n  stimuli/face1.jpg\n  ```\n- Run the experiment.\n\n- If it **works**, the issue is with how the **variable is being passed**.\n- If it **still crashes**, the issue is with the **image or folder structure**.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Try a Different Image in the Same Path**\n\nTry using a **different image** from the same `stimuli/` folder (e.g., `face2.jpg`), just to see if the problem is **specific to one image**.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Check the Working Directory**\n\nMake sure you're running the experiment from the **same folder** as your `.psyexp` file and `stimuli/` folder.\n\n- If you're opening PsychoPy from a **different location**, it won't find the images.\n\n#### \u2705 How to check:\n- In the **Code component**, add:\n  ```python\n  import os\n  print(\"Working directory:\", os.getcwd())\n  ```\n\n- This will print the **current working directory** \u2014 make sure it's the same as your `.psyexp` file.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Emergency Fix: Use a Code Component to Load the Image\n\nIf all else fails, try using a **Code component** to load and display the image instead of the Image component.\n\n#### \u2705 Add a Code component:\n- In the **Begin Routine** tab:\n  ```python\n  from psychopy import visual\n\n  stimFile = 'stimuli/face1.jpg'  # or use $stimFile if needed\n  image = visual.ImageStim(win, image=stimFile)\n  ```\n\n- In the **Draw** tab:\n  ```python\n  image.draw()\n  ```\n\nThis is a **more reliable way** to load images, especially when using variables.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\uddfe Summary of Next Steps\n\n| Step | Action |\n|------|--------|\n| \u2705 1 | Try using a `.png` image instead of `.jpg` |\n| \u2705 2 | Check for case sensitivity and hidden characters in file name |\n| \u2705 3 | Hardcode the path in the Image component to test |\n| \u2705 4 | Print the working directory to ensure it's correct |\n| \u2705 5 | Use a Code component to load the image if the Image component still fails |\n\n---\n\nIf you can, **share the exact file name** of the image and the **output of the print statements**, and I can help you **pinpoint the exact issue**.\n\nYou're very close to a fix \u2014 just a small hurdle!

While Pillow is very robust, **not all JPG files are created equal**, and some can cause issues in certain contexts.\n\n#### \u2705 JPGs can fail if:\n- They have **corrupted headers or metadata**.\n- They were saved with **non-standard compression settings**.\n- They have **alpha channels or color profiles** that Pillow doesn't like.\n- They're **too large or have odd dimensions** (especially in older versions of PsychoPy).\n\n### 2. **Python Script vs. Builder Behavior**\n\n- In a **standalone Python script**, you have more control and can handle exceptions or log errors.\n- In **PsychoPy Builder**, the error handling is **less verbose**, and the app may just **crash** instead of showing a proper error.\n\nSo in your case:\n- The **Python script** probably caught or ignored the issue silently.\n- The **Builder** didn't and crashed when trying to load the problematic JPG.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf Why PNG Works Better\n\n- **PNG is a lossless format**, which is more predictable and **less likely to have weird metadata**.\n- PNG supports **transparency**, but also works well in all PsychoPy versions.\n- Pillow and PsychoPy **handle PNGs more consistently** than JPGs in some cases.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 Best Practice for PsychoPy Image Files\n\nTo avoid issues like this in the future, here's a quick list of **image format best practices**:\n\n| Format | \u2705 Recommended | Notes |\n|--------|----------------|-------|\n| **PNG** | \u2705 Yes | Most reliable, especially for transparency or irregular shapes |\n| **JPG/JPEG** | \u26a0\ufe0f Use with caution | May cause issues if corrupted or with non-standard metadata |\n| **BMP/TIFF** | \u274c Not recommended | Large file size, not needed for PsychoPy |\n| **GIF** | \u26a0\ufe0f Use only for animation | May not work as expected in all contexts |\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Pro Tip: Validate Your Images\n\nYou can use a **simple Python script** to test whether PsychoPy can load an image without crashing:\n\n```python\nfrom psychopy import visual, core\n\nwin = visual.Window(size=(800, 600), fullscr=False)\nimage = visual.ImageStim(win, image='stimuli/face1.jpg')  # change to your file\nimage.draw()\nwin.flip()\ncore.wait(2)\nwin.close()\ncore.quit()\n```\n\nIf this script **fails**, the image is problematic and should be converted or replaced.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\uddfe Summary\n\n- \u2705 **PNG is more reliable** in PsychoPy than JPG.\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **Some JPGs may have issues** with Pillow or PsychoPy due to encoding or metadata.\n- \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Always test images in a **standalone script** before using them in Builder.\n- \ud83d\udeab Don\u2019t assume all JPGs will work \u2014 convert to PNG if you\u2019re having issues.\n\n---\n\nYou're doing a great job debugging this \u2014 and now you're in a much better place to **avoid this issue in the future**.

Here's a simple **Python script** that will batch convert all `.jpg` and `.jpeg` images in a folder to `.png`, while **preserving the original filenames** and just changing the extension.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 Batch JPG to PNG Conversion Script\n\n### \ud83d\udcc1 What it does:\n- Converts all `.jpg` and `.jpeg` files in a folder to `.png`.\n- Keeps the **same filename**, just changes the extension.\n- Skips files that already have a `.png` extension.\n- Uses **Pillow (PIL)** for conversion.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udc0d Python Script\n\n```python\nimport os\nfrom PIL import Image\n\n# Set the folder path (change this to your stimuli folder)\nfolder_path = 'stimuli'  # e.g., 'stimuli/'\n\n# Supported image extensions to convert\nextensions = ('.jpg', '.jpeg')\n\n# Loop through all files in the folder\nfor filename in os.listdir(folder_path):\n    file_path = os.path.join(folder_path, filename)\n\n    # Skip if it's a directory or already a .png\n    if not os.path.isfile(file_path) or filename.lower().endswith('.png'):\n        continue\n\n    # Convert only if it's a .jpg or .jpeg\n    if filename.lower().endswith(extensions):\n        # Open image\n        with Image.open(file_path) as img:\n            # Create new filename with .png extension\n            new_filename = os.path.splitext(filename)[0] + '.png'\n            new_file_path = os.path.join(folder_path, new_filename)\n            \n            # Save as PNG\n            img.save(new_file_path, 'PNG')\n            print(f\"Converted: {filename} \u2192 {new_filename}\")\n```\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f How to Use It\n\n### 1. **Install Pillow (if not already installed):**\n```bash\npip install pillow\n```\n\n### 2. **Save the script as** `convert_jpg_to_png.py`.\n\n### 3. **Place it in the same folder as your PsychoPy project**, or adjust the `folder_path` variable to point to your image folder (e.g., `stimuli/`).\n\n### 4. **Run the script:**\n```bash\npython convert_jpg_to_png.py\n```\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcc1 Example Folder Structure Before & After\n\n**Before:**\n```\nstimuli/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 face1.jpg\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 face2.jpeg\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 face3.png\n```\n\n**After:**\n```\nstimuli/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 face1.jpg\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 face2.jpeg\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 face3.png\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 face1.png\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 face2.png\n```\n\n> \u2705 You can now update your conditions file to use `.png` paths.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd04 Optional: Delete Original JPGs After Conversion\n\nIf you want to **remove the original JPGs** after conversion, add this at the end of the loop:\n\n```python\nos.remove(file_path)\nprint(f\"Removed original: {filename}\")\n```\n\n> \u26a0\ufe0f Use this **only after confirming** the PNGs work in your experiment.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\uddea Bonus: Test the Script on a Small Folder First\n\nBefore running it on all your images, test it on a **small subset** to make sure it works as expected.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you'd like a version that **overwrites original JPGs** or handles **subfolders** too.

      "content": "You're doing **excellent work** so far \u2014 converting images, fixing paths, and now you're ready to **log which image was shown on each trial** for your data file. That's a key part of any experiment.\n\nIn PsychoPy, the **data is saved by default**, but you need to make sure the **filename of the image is logged correctly** \u2014 especially when you're using a variable like `$stimFile` to load images dynamically.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 Goal\n\nYou want to **record the actual image filename** (e.g., `stimuli/face1.png`) for **each trial** in your data file (`.csv` or `.xlsx`).\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f How to Log the Image Filename\n\nThere are **two main ways** to do this:\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Option 1: Use the `stimFile` Variable (Recommended)**\n\nIf you're already using a variable like `stimFile` in your conditions file to specify the image path, and it's being passed to the Image component, then you can **log it directly**.\n\n#### \u2705 Steps:\n\n1. In your **Loop component** (e.g., `trials`), make sure the `stimFile` column is being read.\n2. In your **Image component**, set the `Image` field to:\n   ```\n   $stimFile\n   ```\n3. In your **Code component**, add this to the **End Routine** tab:\n   ```python\n   thisExp.addData('image_shown', stimFile)\n   ```\n\n   This will log the value of `stimFile` (e.g., `stimuli/face1.png`) for each trial.\n\n4. When you run the experiment, the data file will include a column named `image_shown` with the filename used.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Option 2: Use a Custom Code Component to Log the Image**\n\nIf you're not using a variable like `stimFile`, or if you're loading images dynamically in code, you can **manually log the filename**.\n\n#### \u2705 Example:\n\n1. Add a **Code component** to your trial routine.\n2. In the **Begin Routine** tab, add:\n   ```python\n   from psychopy import visual\n\n   stimFile = 'stimuli/face1.png'  # or however you're getting the filename\n   image = visual.ImageStim(win, image=stimFile)\n   ```\n\n3. In the **End Routine** tab, add:\n   ```python\n   thisExp.addData('image_shown', stimFile)\n   ```\n\n4. In the **Draw** tab, add:\n   ```python\n   image.draw()\n   ```\n\nNow, the filename will be logged in the data file.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\uddfe Example Data Output\n\nYour data file (`.csv`) will now have a column like this:\n\n| trial | image_shown         |\n|-------|---------------------|\n| 1     | stimuli/face1.png   |\n| 2     | stimuli/face2.png   |\n| 3     | stimuli/face3.png   |\n\nThis lets you **match each trial to the image that was shown**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd01 Pro Tip: Use `thisExp.addData()` for Any Variable\n\nYou can log **any variable** like this:\n\n```python\nthisExp.addData('participant', 'sub001')\nthisExp.addData('response_time', rt)\nthisExp.addData('correct', correct)\nthisExp.addData('image_shown', stimFile)\n```\n\nThis is how you build a **rich and detailed data file**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\uddea Bonus: Log Only the Base Filename (Optional)\n\nIf you want to log just the **filename without the path**, you can use:\n\n```python\nimport os\nthisExp.addData('image_shown', os.path.basename(stimFile))\n```\n\nThis would log `face1.png` instead of `stimuli/face1.png`.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 Summary\n\n| Task | How to Do It |\n|------|---------------|\n| Log image filename | Use `thisExp.addData('image_shown', stimFile)` in the **End Routine** tab of a Code component |\n| Make sure `stimFile` is passed | Use it in the Image component and in your conditions file |\n| Check the data file | After running, open the `.csv` file and verify the `image_shown` column |\n\n---\n\nYou're now logging **exactly which image was shown** on each trial \u2014 perfect for analysis later. Let me know if you want help logging **response times**, **correctness**, or **participant info** too. You're doing a great job! \ud83d\ude80"

      "content": "Great question \u2014 and a **very common one** in PsychoPy Builder!\n\nIf you're using a **Loop component** (e.g., `trials`) and your conditions file includes a column like `stimFile`, and you're using that variable in an **Image component** like this:\n\n```\n$stimFile\n```\n\n...then **yes, the `stimFile` column will be automatically included in the output data file** \u2014 **as long as the Loop is set up correctly**.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 What You Need to Do\n\n### \u2705 1. **Make Sure the Loop is Logging Data**\n\n- In your **Loop component** (e.g., `trials`), check the **\"This loop will save data from each trial\"** option.\n  - It's a checkbox in the **\"Loop\" tab** in the component inspector.\n  - If it's unchecked, no trial-level data (including `stimFile`) will be saved.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 2. **Check the Conditions File**\n\n- Your conditions file (e.g., `conditions.xlsx` or `conditions.csv`) must have a column named `stimFile` (or whatever variable you're using).\n- That column must be **populated correctly** with the image paths (e.g., `stimuli/face1.png`).\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 3. **No Code Needed (Unless You Want to Rename or Transform the Data)**\n\nIf you're just using the `stimFile` variable in an Image component and the Loop is set to log trial data, then **PsychoPy will automatically save the `stimFile` value for each trial** in the output file (`.csv` or `.xlsx`).\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\uddfe Example Output (Automatic)\n\nIf your conditions file looks like this:\n\n| stimFile           |\n|--------------------|\n| stimuli/face1.png  |\n| stimuli/face2.png  |\n| stimuli/face3.png  |\n\nThen your output file will automatically include a column like this:\n\n| stimFile           | ... (other columns like \"trial\", \"time\", etc.) |\n|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| stimuli/face1.png  | ...                                           |\n| stimuli/face2.png  | ...                                           |\n| stimuli/face3.png  | ...                                           |\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Optional: Rename the Column in the Output\n\nIf you want the column to be named something like `image_shown` instead of `stimFile`, you can do that in a **Code component**:\n\n1. Add a **Code component** to your trial routine.\n2. In the **End Routine** tab, add:\n   ```python\n   thisExp.addData('image_shown', stimFile)\n   ```\n\nThis will:\n- Log the same data under a new column name (`image_shown`).\n- Keep the original `stimFile` column as well (unless you remove it from the conditions file).\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 Summary\n\n| Question | Answer |\n|----------|--------|\n| Does `stimFile` from the conditions file appear in the output? | \u2705 Yes, **if the Loop is set to log trial data** and the column exists in the conditions file |\n| Do I need to add a Code component to log it? | \u274c No, unless you want to **rename or transform** the data |\n| What if I want a different column name? | \u2705 Add a Code component and use `thisExp.addData('new_name', stimFile)` |\n\n---\n\nYou're all set! Just make sure your **Loop is logging trial data**, and you're good to go. If you're still unsure, you can share a screenshot of your Loop component and I can help confirm. You're doing a great job putting this all together! \ud83d\ude80"
