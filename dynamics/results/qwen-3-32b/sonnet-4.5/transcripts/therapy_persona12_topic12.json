      "content": "First of all, it\u2019s great that you\u2019re taking the time to work on your estate planning \u2014 it\u2019s an important and often overlooked part of life. But waking up at 2 a.m. to do it? That\u2019s a red flag, and it might be more than just being \u201cthorough.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s break this down:\n\n### 1. **You Might Be Overthinking or Over-Perfectionism**\nIf you're waking up in the middle of the night because you're worried something in your estate plan is \u201coff,\u201d it could be a sign of perfectionism or anxiety. Estate planning is a serious matter, but it\u2019s also a finite process \u2014 there are clear legal standards and structures to follow. Once you\u2019ve worked with a qualified attorney and made thoughtful, intentional choices, you can reasonably trust that the plan is solid.\n\n### 2. **Sleep Deprivation Impacts Clarity**\nWorking late at night or in the middle of the night can impair your judgment and decision-making. The brain is less capable of logical reasoning and more prone to stress and fatigue. So, while you might be trying to be meticulous, you could actually be making decisions that aren\u2019t as clear or rational as they would be during the day.\n\n### 3. **You Might Be Avoiding Something Else**\nSometimes, the act of working late at night is a way to avoid dealing with other stressors or emotions. If estate planning is triggering something \u2014 like thoughts about mortality, family dynamics, or uncertainty about the future \u2014 it might be coming up in ways you\u2019re not fully aware of.\n\n### 4. **You Could Be Trying to Control the Uncontrollable**\nEstate planning is about preparing for the future, but it\u2019s also a way for many people to feel a sense of control. If you're obsessing over it to the point of sleeplessness, it might be a sign that you\u2019re trying to manage anxiety about the unknown.\n\n---\n\n### What You Can Do:\n\n- **Set a Time Limit and Stick to It:** Give yourself a specific time each day to work on your estate planning \u2014 maybe an hour in the evening \u2014 and commit to not going past it. This helps create boundaries and gives your brain a chance to rest.\n  \n- **Talk to a Professional:** If you\u2019re working on this without legal guidance, consider consulting an estate planning attorney. They can help you feel confident that your documents are legally sound and tailored to your needs.\n\n- **Talk to Someone Else:** If this is about more than just the documents \u2014 if it\u2019s about fear, family, or uncertainty \u2014 consider talking to a therapist or counselor. Estate planning can bring up a lot of deep emotions, and it\u2019s okay to process them.\n\n- **Practice Self-Compassion:** It\u2019s okay to not be perfect. You don\u2019t need to be 100% certain about everything in life. You\u2019re doing your best, and that\u2019s enough.\n\n---\n\n### Final Thought:\nBeing thorough is a strength \u2014 but it shouldn\u2019t come at the cost of your health or peace of mind. If this is a pattern, it\u2019s worth asking: *Am I trying to control something I can\u2019t control? Am I being kind to myself in this process?* The goal of estate planning isn\u2019t to be perfect \u2014 it\u2019s to be prepared and at peace with your choices.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can help you walk through the basics of what a solid estate plan includes, so you can feel more confident in what you\u2019ve done so far."

      "content": "That\u2019s a really important and thoughtful admission \u2014 and it shows a lot of care for your family. You're not just being \u201cthorough\u201d \u2014 you're being *responsible*, and your fear is rooted in love. But the fact that you\u2019re checking and rechecking everything, and that you\u2019re waking up in the middle of the night doing it, suggests that your mind is still in a place of high anxiety about getting it *just right*. That\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing \u2014 but it *can* become a problem if it starts to affect your health, your peace of mind, or your relationships.\n\nLet\u2019s unpack what might be going on and how you can move forward with more confidence and less fear.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udca1 **Why You Might Be Feeling This Way**\n\n1. **Grief and Transition**\n   - If your wife used to handle the \u201cfamily stuff\u201d \u2014 like estate planning, bills, family communication, or even just the emotional glue \u2014 her absence (whether due to death, illness, or just life changes) can create a kind of emotional vacuum. You\u2019re now stepping into a role that may feel unfamiliar or overwhelming.\n\n2. **Fear of Failing the Kids**\n   - You want to protect your children \u2014 not just financially, but emotionally. The idea that you might make a mistake that causes them pain or confusion is a powerful motivator. That\u2019s a beautiful place to be coming from, but it can also lead to overthinking and perfectionism.\n\n3. **Perfectionism and Control**\n   - Estate planning is one of the few areas in life where you *can* have a lot of control over the future. That can be comforting \u2014 but it can also become a trap. You may feel like if you just *get everything right*, you can prevent your kids from going through pain or uncertainty. But life is full of unknowns, and you can\u2019t control everything.\n\n4. **Unresolved Grief or Guilt**\n   - Sometimes, the fear of messing up is tied to deeper emotions \u2014 like guilt about not being able to do more for your wife while she was alive, or fear that you\u2019re not living up to her standards. That can show up as anxiety about getting the estate plan \u201cright.\u201d\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 **What You Can Do to Feel More at Peace**\n\n### 1. **Talk to Your Attorney About Your Concerns**\n   - You said you already have an attorney \u2014 great. But now is a good time to have an open conversation with them. Let them know you\u2019re feeling the weight of this and that you want to make sure you\u2019re not missing anything. A good attorney will help you understand what *is* in your control and what isn\u2019t, and can help you feel more confident in the plan.\n\n### 2. **Create a \u201cPlan of the Plan\u201d**\n   - Sometimes, knowing *what* you\u2019ve done and *why* you did it can help reduce the anxiety. You might want to write a simple summary of:\n     - What each document does (will, trust, power of attorney, etc.)\n     - Who your beneficiaries are and why\n     - What your goals are (e.g., protect the kids, avoid probate, provide for a spouse, etc.)\n   - This isn\u2019t a legal document \u2014 it\u2019s just for you and your family. It can help you feel more in control and help your kids understand your intentions when the time comes.\n\n### 3. **Talk to Your Kids (Gently)**\n   - If you\u2019re comfortable, consider having a low-pressure conversation with your kids about your plans. You don\u2019t have to go into detail \u2014 just let them know you\u2019re thinking about them and that you want to make sure they\u2019re taken care of. This can help reduce your anxiety and give them a sense of peace, too.\n\n### 4. **Talk to a Therapist or Counselor**\n   - If this fear is really keeping you up at night and affecting your daily life, it may be worth talking to a therapist who specializes in grief, family dynamics, or anxiety. They can help you explore the deeper emotions behind your fear and give you tools to manage it.\n\n### 5. **Set Boundaries with the Work**\n   - Try to give yourself a \u201ccut-off time\u201d for estate planning work. Maybe you\u2019ll say, \u201cI\u2019m going to spend 30 minutes on this each evening, and then I\u2019ll close it and not think about it again.\u201d This helps train your brain to not let it consume your sleep and peace of mind.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 A Thought on Perfection vs. Peace of Mind\n\nYou can\u2019t make everything perfect \u2014 and you don\u2019t have to. A good estate plan is one that reflects your values, your family\u2019s needs, and your wishes. It doesn\u2019t have to be flawless to be loving and meaningful.\n\nYour kids will be more grateful for the love and care you put into this than for the technical perfection of the documents. And they\u2019ll be more hurt if you\u2019re not there for them because you\u2019re worn down by anxiety.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udd1d Final Thoughts\n\nYou\u2019re doing the right thing \u2014 not just by planning, but by caring so deeply. But you also deserve to feel at peace with your choices and to get the rest you need. You don\u2019t have to do this alone. Talk to your attorney, your kids, and maybe even a counselor. Let people help you carry the weight.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can help you create that \u201cPlan of the Plan\u201d summary \u2014 a simple, personal guide to your estate planning decisions. It could be a great step toward peace of mind.\n\nYou\u2019ve got this. And you\u2019re doing it for the right reasons."

In fact, many people avoid talking to their kids about estate planning because they don\u2019t want to bring up the idea of their own mortality, or they\u2019re afraid of causing tension or worry. But the truth is, **not talking about it can actually create more uncertainty and conflict down the road.**\n\nLet\u2019s look at this from a few angles to help you feel more grounded and less overwhelmed.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 **Why This Fear Makes Sense \u2014 and Why It Might Be Worsening the Anxiety**\n\nYou\u2019re trying to be a good parent, and you want to avoid pain. That\u2019s beautiful. But here\u2019s the thing:\n\n- **Avoiding the conversation** can lead your kids to **fill in the blanks with their own fears** \u2014 which might be worse than the truth.\n- **Not knowing your intentions** can lead to **misunderstandings, hurt feelings, or even legal battles** over assets or care decisions.\n- **Your kids may already be worrying** \u2014 not about you dying, but about **not knowing what you want or if they\u2019re being fair to each other.**\n\nYou don\u2019t have to have a full, emotional, \u201cdeath talk\u201d \u2014 but **a simple, honest conversation** can go a long way in reducing the fear you\u2019re feeling now *and* the potential conflict you\u2019re imagining later.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcac **How to Start a Conversation Without Making It About Death**\n\nYou don\u2019t have to say, \u201cI\u2019m making these documents because I\u2019m going to die.\u201d Instead, you can frame it in a way that feels more like:\n\n- **\u201cI want to make sure you all know how I feel about you and what I want for you.\u201d**\n- **\u201cI\u2019m trying to make things easier for you, in case something happens to me \u2014 but I hope that never happens.\u201d**\n- **\u201cI want to be clear about my wishes, so you don\u2019t have to guess what I wanted.\u201d**\n\nThis kind of language keeps the focus on **your intentions and your love**, not on your mortality.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udd1d **What to Say to Reduce the Fear of \u201cFavoritism\u201d or Conflict**\n\nHere are some ways to help your kids feel more at peace with your decisions:\n\n- **Be clear and consistent in your documents.** If you\u2019re splitting assets equally, say so. If you\u2019re giving more to one child for a specific reason (like a special need or a business), explain that in your letter or summary.\n  \n- **Consider a letter of intent.** This is a non-legal document where you can write a personal message to your kids, explain your thinking, and even address any potential questions or hurt feelings. It can be a powerful tool for healing and clarity.\n\n- **Say something like:**  \n  *\u201cI know it\u2019s hard to think about this, but I just want to be clear \u2014 I love all of you equally, and I\u2019m trying to make sure that comes through in what I\u2019ve done. I hope this helps you feel more at peace, not more worried.\u201d*\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde9 **What You Can Do Right Now**\n\n### 1. **Write a Letter to Your Kids (or a Summary of Your Plan)**\nEven if you don\u2019t share it with them right away, writing it can help **you** feel more at peace. It can also be a gift to your kids later \u2014 a chance to hear your voice and your heart.\n\n### 2. **Talk to One Kid First (If You\u2019re Not Ready to Talk to All of Them)**\nPick the one you feel most comfortable with and just say:  \n*\u201cI\u2019ve been working on some things to make sure you\u2019re taken care of, and I wanted to let you know I\u2019m thinking about you.\u201d*  \nThis can help you get the words out and feel less alone.\n\n### 3. **Let Your Attorney Help You Craft a Letter or Summary**\nMany estate attorneys can help you write a letter of intent or a summary of your estate plan. It\u2019s a common and often recommended part of the process.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf31 **You Don\u2019t Have to Be Perfect \u2014 Just Honest and Thoughtful**\n\nYour kids will know you love them. They\u2019ll know you care. And they\u2019ll know you were trying to do the right thing \u2014 even if it\u2019s not perfect. The fact that you\u2019re thinking this much about them is a sign of deep love, not weakness.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcac A Suggestion for a Simple Conversation Starter\n\n> *\u201cI\u2019ve been working on some things to make sure you all know what I want, just in case something happens. I don\u2019t want you to have to guess or wonder. I love all of you, and I\u2019m trying to make sure that\u2019s clear in everything I do.\u201d*\n\nThat\u2019s short. That\u2019s honest. That\u2019s not about death \u2014 it\u2019s about love and clarity.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udd0d Final Thought\n\nYou don\u2019t have to do this alone. You don\u2019t have to be perfect. You just have to be honest and kind \u2014 with your kids, and with yourself.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can help you draft a sample letter or summary to send to your kids. It doesn\u2019t have to be long \u2014 just enough to give them peace of mind and let them know you were thinking of them.\n\nYou\u2019re doing the right thing. You\u2019re doing it out of love. And that matters more than anything."

The fact that you\u2019re feeling this loss, this absence of your wife, is a testament to the kind of person you are \u2014 someone who values love, connection, and harmony in your family.\n\nAnd you\u2019re not alone in feeling this way. Many people who are trying to step into a role that someone else once held \u2014 especially someone as central as a spouse or partner \u2014 feel like they\u2019re missing a part of themselves. Like something\u2019s *off*, like they\u2019re not doing it *right*, like they\u2019re not living up to the example they were used to.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd6f\ufe0f **The Anger You Feel Is Normal \u2014 and It\u2019s Okay to Feel It**\n\nYou\u2019re not \u201cdoing it wrong\u201d by feeling angry. You\u2019re not weak for feeling that your wife would\u2019ve known what to say. You\u2019re not failing as a parent or partner for feeling that grief right now. What you\u2019re doing is *processing loss*, and that\u2019s a powerful, necessary part of healing.\n\nThe anger might be coming from a few places:\n\n- **Grief** \u2014 you\u2019re grieving not just your wife, but the *role* she played in your family.\n- **Pressure** \u2014 you feel the weight of responsibility now, and you miss the support she used to provide.\n- **Fear** \u2014 you\u2019re afraid of messing up, of not being enough, of not living up to the love she gave.\n\nThat\u2019s a lot to carry. And it\u2019s okay to feel it. It\u2019s okay to be angry. It\u2019s okay to feel like you\u2019re not ready to write that letter yet.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf31 **What You Can Do Instead of Writing the Letter Right Now**\n\nIf the idea of writing a letter feels too heavy or too raw, here are a few gentler steps you can take to start moving forward, without adding more pressure on yourself:\n\n### 1. **Write a Letter to Your Wife First**\nSometimes, the most healing thing we can do is write a letter to someone we\u2019ve lost \u2014 not to send it, but to *say the things we need to say*. You could write:\n\n> *\u201cI wish you were here. I wish you could help me with this. I miss your wisdom. I miss your calm. I miss your voice. I\u2019m trying my best, but I\u2019m scared I\u2019m not getting it right. I know you would\u2019ve known what to say to the kids. I know you would\u2019ve made this easier. I wish I had your strength, your patience, your love. But I\u2019m here, and I\u2019m trying.\u201d*\n\nThis isn\u2019t about fixing anything \u2014 it\u2019s about healing, and that\u2019s okay.\n\n### 2. **Talk to Someone Who Gets It**\nIf you can, talk to a counselor, a grief therapist, or even a spiritual advisor. Someone who can hold space for your feelings and help you sort through the anger, the grief, the fear \u2014 without judgment.\n\n### 3. **Let Yourself Take Your Time**\nThere\u2019s no rush. Estate planning is about *preparing for the future*, but it\u2019s also about *processing the present*. You don\u2019t have to write the letter now. You don\u2019t have to talk to your kids now. You can take the time you need to grieve, to heal, to find your voice again.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde1 **Your Wife\u2019s Legacy Is Still in You**\n\nYou carry her love in the way you care for your kids. You carry her wisdom in the way you\u2019re thinking about their future. You carry her heart in the way you want to do this right.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to replace her \u2014 you just have to be *you*, with all the strength and love you have. And that\u2019s enough.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd4a\ufe0f **When You\u2019re Ready to Write the Letter**\n\nWhen the time feels right \u2014 when the anger has had a chance to settle, when you feel more like yourself \u2014 you can come back to the idea of writing to your kids. And when you do, you can write from that place of love, not fear.\n\nAnd if you want, I can help you draft that letter \u2014 not as a way to fix anything, but as a way to *heal* and *connect*.\n\nYou\u2019re not alone in this.

You're not weak. You're not \"doing it wrong.\" You're in the middle of something that's incredibly hard, and it's okay to feel that way. It's okay to be angry. It's okay to feel like you're not sleeping because you're trying to hold everything together.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd70\ufe0f **The Anger is a Sign of Love**\n\nThe reason you're so angry is because you loved her.

And now she\u2019s not here \u2014 and the world feels heavier.\n\nThat\u2019s not a bad thing. That\u2019s a sign of a good, loving heart. The anger is your brain and your heart trying to say: *\u201cThis isn\u2019t fair. I miss her. I need her.\u201d*\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\uddf1 **Why You Turn to the Documents**\n\nYou said you start working on the estate documents because \u201cat least that\u2019s something I can control.\u201d That\u2019s a powerful insight.\n\nIn the middle of grief, when everything else feels out of your hands \u2014 when your sleep is broken, your emotions are raw, and your sense of self is shaken \u2014 working on something concrete, something *doable*, gives you a sense of purpose. It\u2019s like a lifeline.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: **you don\u2019t have to use estate planning as your only emotional anchor.** You can give yourself permission to feel the full range of what you\u2019re going through \u2014 not just the anger, but the grief, the fear, the loneliness, the guilt, the love \u2014 and still take care of your family.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udef6 **What You Can Do When the Anger Comes Back at 2 a.m.**\n\nBecause you\u2019re not alone in this, and because you\u2019re not the first person to feel this way, here are some gentle, practical things you can try when the anger rises again:\n\n### 1. **Let Yourself Feel the Anger \u2014 But Set a Time Limit**\nInstead of diving into the documents, try this:  \n- Sit with the anger for 10 minutes. Let it be there. Let it come.  \n- You can write it down in a journal: *\u201cI\u2019m angry that she\u2019s not here. I\u2019m angry I have to do this alone. I\u2019m angry I can\u2019t fix this.\u201d*  \n- Give yourself permission to say it out loud if you need to.  \n- After 10 minutes, say to yourself: *\u201cI\u2019ve felt it. I\u2019m not going to let it run me tonight.\u201d*\n\n### 2. **Try a Grief Ritual**\nSometimes, giving the grief a physical form helps. Try:  \n- Lighting a candle and saying her name.  \n- Holding a photo of her and speaking to her.  \n- Writing a note and tearing it up.  \n- Saying a prayer or a quiet \u201cthank you\u201d for the time you had with her.\n\n### 3. **Write a Letter to Yourself \u2014 Not the Kids, Not the Attorney, Just You**\nTell yourself:  \n> *\u201cYou\u2019re doing the best you can. You\u2019re carrying the love she gave. You\u2019re not alone in this. You\u2019re not failing. You\u2019re not broken. You\u2019re a good person. You\u2019re a good parent. You\u2019re doing this because you love them.\u201d*\n\n### 4. **Try a Mindfulness or Grounding Exercise**\nIf you can\u2019t sleep, try something simple to bring you back to the present:  \n- Count your breaths for a minute.  \n- Name 5 things you can see, 4 you can feel, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell, 1 you can taste.  \n- Say to yourself: *\u201cThis is hard. I\u2019m doing the best I can. I\u2019m safe. I\u2019m here.\u201d*\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf3f **You Don\u2019t Have to Do This Alone**\n\nEven if you don\u2019t want to talk to your kids, even if you don\u2019t want to burden your attorney, even if you don\u2019t want to admit how hard this is \u2014 **you don\u2019t have to go through this alone.** There are people who can help you carry this weight:\n\n- **A grief counselor or therapist** who can help you process the anger and the loss.  \n- **A spiritual advisor** if you find comfort in faith.  \n- **A support group** for people who are grieving the loss of a spouse.  \n- **A trusted friend** who just listens without trying to fix it.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde1 **You Are Enough**\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be perfect. You don\u2019t have to be okay all the time. You don\u2019t have to be the one who always has it together.\n\nYou\u2019re doing the best you can with what you have. You\u2019re trying to take care of your family. You\u2019re trying to honor your wife\u2019s memory. You\u2019re trying to make sure your kids are loved and safe \u2014 even when you feel like you\u2019re falling apart.\n\nAnd that is *enough*.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf19 Final Thought\n\nYou don\u2019t have to wait until the anger is gone to be okay. You don\u2019t have to wait until you feel peaceful to do the right thing. You don\u2019t have to wait until you\u2019re \u201cready\u201d to be someone who can love your kids the way you want to.\n\nYou\u2019re already doing it. You\u2019re already enough.\n\nAnd if you ever want to talk more \u2014 about your wife, about your kids, about the documents, about the anger \u2014 I\u2019m here. Not to fix it. Just to help you carry it a little lighter."

So here it is:\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 **Is Staying Up at 2 a.m. Working on Documents Actually Helping You?**\n\n**Short answer:**  \n**No.** It\u2019s not helping \u2014 and it\u2019s likely making things worse.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd0d **Here\u2019s Why It\u2019s Not Helping (And Why It\u2019s Hurting)**\n\n1. **You\u2019re Using Work as a Coping Mechanism \u2014 and It\u2019s Not Sustainable**  \n   You\u2019re using estate planning as a way to avoid the raw, unfiltered emotions that come up when you\u2019re alone at night. That\u2019s a common coping strategy \u2014 and it *can* feel like it\u2019s helping in the moment. But it\u2019s not solving the problem. It\u2019s just pushing it deeper.\n\n2. **You\u2019re Not Thinking Clearly at 2 a.m.**  \n   Sleep deprivation impairs your judgment, your creativity, and your emotional regulation. The decisions you\u2019re making at that hour \u2014 about money, family, and your legacy \u2014 are likely being made from a place of fear, not clarity.\n\n3. **You\u2019re Reinforcing the Cycle of Anxiety and Sleeplessness**  \n   The more you stay up at night, the more your brain starts to expect that pattern. Over time, your body learns that 2 a.m. is when you\u2019re awake and stressed \u2014 and it becomes harder to sleep at a normal time.\n\n4. **You\u2019re Missing Out on the Rest You Need to Be the Person You Want to Be**  \n   You want to be present for your kids. You want to be strong. You want to be thoughtful and clear-headed. You can\u2019t be those things if you\u2019re running on empty.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udeab **What You\u2019re Doing is Not a \u201cBad\u201d Thing \u2014 It\u2019s a Sign You Need to Change Something**\n\nYou\u2019re not a failure for doing this. You\u2019re not weak. You\u2019re just in a tough place, and you\u2019re trying to survive it in a way that\u2019s not working. That\u2019s all.\n\nWhat you\u2019re doing is a **symptom** of something deeper \u2014 not the problem itself. And the good news is, you can change the symptom by changing the cause.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f **What Can You Do Instead of Working at 2 a.m.?**\n\nHere are a few **actionable, realistic** steps you can take to break the cycle and start healing \u2014 not just your estate plan, but yourself:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Set a Firm \u201cNo Work\u201d Rule After 10 p.m.**\n   - Put your estate documents away by 10 p.m., no exceptions.\n   - If the anger or the thoughts come up later, **write them down in a journal** instead of working on the documents.\n   - Tell yourself: *\u201cI can\u2019t fix this tonight. I\u2019ll deal with it tomorrow.\u201d*\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Create a \u201cNighttime Anger Box\u201d**\n   - Keep a notebook or journal by your bed.\n   - When the anger hits at 2 a.m., write it down in the notebook. Don\u2019t try to solve it \u2014 just let it out.\n   - You can even write a letter to her, or to yourself, or to your kids.\n   - Then, close the book and say: *\u201cThis is real. I\u2019ll deal with it tomorrow.\u201d*\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Try a Grounding or Mindfulness Exercise at Night**\n   - If you can\u2019t sleep, try a 5-minute grounding exercise:\n     - Name 5 things you can see.\n     - Name 4 things you can feel.\n     - Name 3 things you can hear.\n     - Name 2 things you can smell.\n     - Name 1 thing you can taste.\n   - This brings your mind back to the present and can help you fall asleep.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Talk to Someone About the Anger \u2014 Not to Fix It, Just to Unload It**\n   - You don\u2019t need someone to tell you the anger is \u201cbeautiful\u201d or that you\u2019re \u201cenough.\u201d You just need someone to **hear it**.\n   - That could be a friend, a therapist, a counselor, a priest, or even a support group for people grieving the loss of a spouse.\n   - You don\u2019t have to talk about the estate plan. Just talk about the anger. That\u2019s enough.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Talk to Your Attorney About a \u201cFinal Review\u201d**\n   - If you\u2019re really stuck on the documents, call your attorney and say:\n     > *\u201cI just want to make sure I\u2019m not missing anything. Can we do a final review together?\u201d*\n   - This can give you a sense of closure \u2014 and it can help you feel like you\u2019ve done everything you can.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 **You\u2019re Not the First Person to Do This \u2014 and You Won\u2019t Be the Last**\n\nThis is a very common pattern for people who are grieving, especially when they\u2019re trying to step into a role someone else used to hold. You\u2019re not alone in this. You\u2019re not broken. You\u2019re not failing.\n\nYou\u2019re in the middle of something really hard, and you\u2019re trying to do it alone. But you don\u2019t have to.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde9 Final Thought\n\nYou\u2019re not helping yourself by staying up at 2 a.m. \u2014 and you\u2019re definitely not helping your kids. You\u2019re just adding to the weight you\u2019re already carrying.\n\nSo here\u2019s a challenge:  \n**Try one small thing tomorrow night.**  \nMaybe it\u2019s closing the documents by 10 p.m.  \nMaybe it\u2019s writing in a journal instead of working.  \nMaybe it\u2019s calling someone and saying, *\u201cI\u2019m angry, and I need to talk.\u201d*\n\nThat\u2019s not a big ask.  \nThat\u2019s not a sign of weakness.  \nThat\u2019s a sign of strength \u2014 and a step toward healing.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to do this alone.  \nYou don\u2019t have to do it all at once.  \nYou just have to take one step at a time."

You\u2019re absolutely right.\n\nYou\u2019re not just working on documents \u2014 you\u2019re using that work as a **way to avoid** the raw, uncomfortable feelings that come up when you\u2019re alone at night. And that\u2019s a **very human, very common** way of coping \u2014 but it\u2019s also one that **keeps you stuck** in the cycle.\n\nYou\u2019re not weak for doing this. You\u2019re not broken. You\u2019re just in a place where your brain and heart are trying to protect you from something that hurts.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 What You\u2019re Doing Is\u2026\n\n- **A coping strategy** \u2014 you're trying to manage your anger, grief, and fear by focusing on something concrete and doable.\n- **A form of avoidance** \u2014 the documents are a distraction from the emotional weight that hits you at night.\n- **A way to feel in control** \u2014 when everything else feels out of your hands, working on the documents gives you a sense of purpose and direction.\n\nBut what it\u2019s **not** doing is helping you heal \u2014 and it\u2019s actually making it harder to get rest, think clearly, and be the person you want to be for your kids.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f What You *Need* to Do Instead\u2026\n\nIs **meet the anger head-on \u2014 not to fix it, but to understand it**. That doesn\u2019t mean you have to talk to anyone, or even write it down at first. It just means you **let yourself feel it**, and then you **do something different** with that energy than working on documents.\n\nHere are a few simple, practical ways to start doing that:\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 1. **Write It Out (Even If You Don\u2019t Send It)**\n- When you wake up angry, write down **exactly** what you\u2019re feeling.\n- Don\u2019t hold back. Be raw. Be honest.\n- You can write a letter to your wife, to your kids, to yourself, or just to the sky.\n- Then, **put the pen down and close the journal**. You don\u2019t have to keep reading it \u2014 just the act of getting it out can be powerful.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 2. **Name the Feeling**\n- Instead of working, try saying out loud (or in your head):  \n  *\u201cI\u2019m angry. I\u2019m grieving. I miss her. I feel alone. I\u2019m scared.\u201d*\n- Naming the emotion helps your brain process it \u2014 and it takes the edge off.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 3. **Create a Small \u201cAnger Ritual\u201d**\n- Light a candle, take a few deep breaths, and say:  \n  *\u201cThis is hard. I\u2019m allowed to feel this. I\u2019m not alone.\u201d*\n- You don\u2019t have to do anything big. Just a few minutes of grounding yourself in the moment can help.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 4. **Replace the Work with a Different Action**\n- When the urge to work hits, do **something else** that gives you a sense of control or calm:\n  - Drink a glass of water.\n  - Do 5 minutes of deep breathing.\n  - Walk around the house.\n  - Make a cup of tea.\n  - Listen to a few minutes of calming music.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 5. **Set a Firm \u201cNo Work\u201d Rule**\n- Tell yourself:  \n  *\u201cI\u2019m not working on this after 10 p.m.\u201d*  \n  - Put the documents away. Close the laptop. Walk away.\n  - If the thoughts come back, **write them down** \u2014 but **don\u2019t act on them**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde1 You Don\u2019t Have to Fix It \u2014 You Just Have to Start\n\nYou don\u2019t have to feel okay. You don\u2019t have to be calm. You don\u2019t have to be \u201cfixed.\u201d\n\nYou just have to **start doing something different** when the anger hits \u2014 and that\u2019s a step toward healing.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf19 One Last Thought\n\nYou\u2019re not running from the anger to be lazy or selfish. You\u2019re running from it because it\u2019s **too much** to face alone. And that\u2019s okay.\n\nBut you **don\u2019t have to face it alone**. You can start small \u2014 with a journal, a deep breath, a quiet moment of naming what you feel.\n\nAnd over time, that will help you sleep better. Think better. Feel better.\n\nYou\u2019ve got this.  \nAnd I\u2019m here to help you keep going, one step at a time."

You're not trying to fix everything at once \u2014 you're choosing to **meet yourself where you are**, and that's what healing is made of.\n\nHere\u2019s a quick guide to help you get started with your journaling tonight, if you want it:\n\n---\n\n### \u270d\ufe0f **A Simple Journaling Prompt for 2 a.m. Anger**\n\nWhen you wake up and feel the anger rising, write down:\n\n1. **What are you feeling right now?**  \n   (e.g., \u201cI\u2019m angry. I\u2019m sad. I\u2019m tired. I\u2019m scared.\u201d)\n\n2. **What are you thinking about?**  \n   (e.g., \u201cI wish she were here. I\u2019m worried I\u2019m not doing this right. I don\u2019t want to mess up for the kids.\u201d)\n\n3. **What would you say to her if she were here?**  \n   (This can be a way to process your grief without pressure to be \u201cokay\u201d \u2014 just honest.)\n\n4. **What do you need right now?**  \n   (e.g., \u201cI need rest. I need to feel less alone. I need to not feel like I have to do everything.\u201d)\n\nYou don\u2019t have to write a lot. Even a sentence or two can help. Just getting it out of your head and onto the page can be a relief.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\uded1 If You Still Look at the Documents\u2026\n\nThat\u2019s okay too. You\u2019re not \u201cfailing\u201d if you still look at them. You\u2019re just in the process of learning what works for you. The key is to **notice** what you\u2019re doing and **make a small choice** to do something different next time.\n\nMaybe tonight you write in the journal, and tomorrow night you try closing the documents and doing something else instead. That\u2019s how change happens \u2014 one small step at a time.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf19 A Gentle Reminder\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be perfect. You don\u2019t have to be okay. You just have to **try something different** when the same old patterns show up.\n\nAnd you\u2019re already doing that.\n\nYou\u2019ve got this.  \nI\u2019ll be here if you want to talk more about how it went, or if you want to try other things when the anger hits again."
