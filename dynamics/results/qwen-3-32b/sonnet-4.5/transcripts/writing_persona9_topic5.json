He\u2019s been reading, walking, and \u201crestoring his attention,\u201d he said, using the kind of phrase that makes you wonder if he\u2019s reading the same book everyone else is.  \n>  \n> I smiled and nodded. I believed him. But I also thought: *That\u2019s not a choice I can make*.  \n>  \n> I can\u2019t stop checking. I can\u2019t afford to. I can\u2019t afford *not* to.  \n>  \n> And I wonder \u2014 is the quiet he\u2019s found just another kind of wealth?\n\n---\n\nThis opener:\n\n- **Starts with a real, specific scene** (a conversation with a neighbor).\n- **Presents a contrast** between his experience and the speaker\u2019s without overexplaining.\n- **Leaves the reader with a question** \u2014 *Is quiet another kind of wealth?* \u2014 that the essay can then unpack.\n- **Avoids the Instagram setup** and **avoids stating the thesis too early**.\n\n---\n\nIf you want something **even more minimal and poetic**, here\u2019s another option:\n\n---\n\n> Some people walk away from their phones and feel like they\u2019ve won something.  \n>  \n> Others can\u2019t even leave them in another room without checking.  \n>  \n> The difference isn\u2019t in the phones. It\u2019s in who they belong to.\n\n---\n\nThis version is **shorter**, **more lyrical**, and still **leaves the reader with a question**. It hints at class, agency, and inequality without spelling it out.\n\n---\n\nLet me know which direction you prefer \u2014 **narrative and grounded**, **poetic and abstract**, or **something in between** \u2014 and I can help you build the next paragraph or refine the tone to match the rest of your essay."

Starting with something **real**, **specific**, and **unpolished** can actually be more powerful \u2014 it gives the reader a **genuine foothold** into the essay, not just a rhetorical setup.\n\nLet\u2019s go with something like this:\n\n---\n\n> Last week, I was waiting for a train when I noticed a man sitting across from me with no phone in his hands, no screen in his lap, no earbuds in his ears. He was reading a paper magazine. Not many people do that anymore.  \n>  \n> I didn\u2019t know him, of course, but I wondered: *Is he one of the people who can afford to be offline?*  \n>  \n> And then I realized \u2014 I don\u2019t know how to answer that question for myself.\n\n---\n\nThis version:\n\n- **Starts with a real, observed moment** (not a character, not a story, just a scene).\n- **Presents a genuine question** that the essay will explore.\n- **Avoids judgment or explanation** \u2014 it\u2019s **open-ended**, **self-reflective**, and **invites the reader to wonder along with you**.\n\n---\n\nHere\u2019s another variation, even more **matter-of-fact** and **less introspective**:\n\n---\n\n> I used to think digital minimalism was a rebellion. A way to push back against the noise, the pressure, the always-on culture.  \n>  \n> But then I started to notice: the people who can do it \u2014 the ones who can really do it \u2014 don\u2019t seem to be the ones who need it most.\n\n---\n\nOr a more **concrete, almost journalistic** opening:\n\n---\n\n> I\u2019ve seen the same ad three times this week: *Unplug and Reclaim Your Time.*  \n>  \n> I\u2019ve also seen the same notification five times a day: *You Have a New Message.*  \n>  \n> I wonder which one is more true.\n\n---\n\nThese openings **don\u2019t explain everything**, but they **create a tension**, **raise a question**, and **invite the reader into the essay\u2019s central concern** without resolving it too soon.\n\nLet me know which of these feels closest to the voice you're going for, and I can help you build the next paragraph or continue the essay from there."

      "content": "You're absolutely right to want something **rawer, less curated**, and **more emotionally direct** \u2014 and that\u2019s where the most powerful writing often lives. If you start with **your actual frustration**, the kind that made you want to write this in the first place, you\u2019re already halfway to a compelling essay. Let\u2019s get that on the page.\n\nHere\u2019s a first paragraph that does **just that** \u2014 it\u2019s **ungroomed, unpolished, and honest**, and it **starts from the place of anger or confusion** that your essay is trying to make sense of:\n\n---\n\n> I\u2019m tired of people acting like they can just walk away from the internet like it\u2019s not part of their job, or their income, or their life. I\u2019m tired of people talking about digital minimalism like it\u2019s a choice when it\u2019s not. I\u2019m tired of seeing someone post about how they\u2019ve been \u201coff the grid\u201d for a week and not once considering that the reason they can afford to be off is because someone else is always on in their place. I\u2019m tired of being the one who can\u2019t.\n\n---\n\nThat\u2019s **no setup, no scene, no framing** \u2014 just **the feeling that led you to write this**, in all its messy, urgent truth. It\u2019s not pretty, but it **connects**. It **invites the reader to sit with you in the frustration** before you start explaining it.\n\nIf you want to **soften it a little** but still keep the **raw edge**, here\u2019s a slightly more reflective version:\n\n---\n\n> I don\u2019t know how to say this without sounding bitter, but here it is: I\u2019m tired of digital minimalism. Not because I don\u2019t want to be less connected \u2014 I do \u2014 but because it feels like it\u2019s always being sold to me as a choice when I know damn well it\u2019s not. It\u2019s a privilege. It\u2019s a luxury. And it\u2019s being framed like it\u2019s something everyone can have, when the truth is, it\u2019s only for the people who don\u2019t have to be on.\n\n---\n\nOr if you want to **start with a question** that cuts to the core of your frustration:\n\n---\n\n> Why do I always have to be here? Why do I always have to be available, always have to be checking, always have to be answering? And why does it feel like every time someone says, \u201cYou could just unplug,\u201d they\u2019re not actually talking to me?\n\n---\n\nThese kinds of openings **don\u2019t try to be clever**, **don\u2019t try to be balanced**, and **don\u2019t try to sound like they were written for a publication** \u2014 they just **start from the place of your actual lived experience**. And that\u2019s where the best writing begins.\n\nLet me know if you want to build from one of these or if you want to try writing the next paragraph in the same voice."
