Here's a warm, sincere, and low-pressure donation reminder you can send to your newsletter subscribers:\n\n---\n\n**Subject:** A Quick Note (and a Small Request\u2026)\n\nHi [First Name],\n\nI hope you\u2019re doing well \u2014 I always love hearing from readers like you, and I\u2019m so grateful for the support you\u2019ve given [your newsletter name] over the past year.\n\nI\u2019m writing today with a small favor to ask. If you enjoy [your newsletter name] and find value in what I share, I\u2019d be incredibly grateful if you could consider making a $10 annual donation to help keep the newsletter going.\n\nThat\u2019s just a couple of coffees a year \u2014 and it makes a *huge* difference in covering the small costs of running the newsletter, like email hosting, time, and the occasional treat to keep me motivated.\n\nYou can make a one-time or recurring donation [here] (just a simple PayPal or card link \u2014 no account needed). Even if you can\u2019t give right now, I still want to thank you for being part of this community.\n\nYou\u2019re the reason I keep writing, and I\u2019m so lucky to share this space with you.\n\nWith gratitude,  \n[Your Name]\n\nP.S. If $10 isn\u2019t quite right for you, no worries at all \u2014 just knowing you\u2019re out there reading is enough to keep me going.

It keeps the focus on your content first, and the ask feels like a warm sign-off.\n\nHere\u2019s how it might look in context:\n\n---\n\nHey [Name],\n\n[Your regular newsletter content goes here \u2014 maybe a few short updates, thoughts, or links...]\n\nThanks for being a part of this \u2014 your support has already helped keep things running.

Here\u2019s a quick breakdown of the most common and easy-to-use options:\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Option 1: Use PayPal (Fast and Simple)**\n\n**Why it works:**  \nPayPal is widely used and requires almost no setup. You can create a **\u201cDonate\u201d button** that links to your PayPal account.\n\n**How to do it:**\n\n1. Go to [PayPal Buttons](https://www.paypal.com/buttons/).\n2. Click **\u201cCreate a PayPal button.\u201d**\n3. Choose **\u201cDonations\u201d** as the button type.\n4. Set the amount to **$10** (or let it be optional).\n5. Add a short message like: \u201cSupport [Your Newsletter Name]\u201d\n6. Customize the button text and color if you want.\n7. Click **\u201cCreate\u201d** and copy the **HTML code** or the **link**.\n\nYou can either:\n- Paste the HTML code directly into your newsletter (if your platform supports it).\n- Or just share the link as a plain text link at the end.\n\n**Example text:**\n> You can support this newsletter with a $10/year donation [here](your-paypal-link).\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Option 2: Use Buy Me a Coffee (Super Casual)**\n\n**Why it works:**  \nIt\u2019s very visual, very low-pressure, and people love it. You get a cute little coffee cup button and a profile page.\n\n**How to do it:**\n\n1. Go to [Buy Me a Coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/).\n2. Sign up for free with your email.\n3. Customize your page (add a photo, short bio, etc.).\n4. Click **\u201cGet Your Button\u201d** and copy the link or embed code.\n\n**Example text:**\n> If you\u2019d like to support this newsletter, you can [buy me a coffee](your-bmc-link) \u2014 even $1 helps!\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Option 3: Use a Substack Tip Jar (If You\u2019re on Substack)**\n\nIf you're using **Substack**, you can turn on the **Tip Jar** feature:\n\n1. Go to your Substack dashboard.\n2. Click on **\u201cSettings\u201d** > **\u201cMonetization\u201d**.\n3. Turn on **Tips** and set a suggested amount (e.g., $10).\n4. Substack will automatically add a tip button to your posts and emails.\n\nThis is by far the easiest if you\u2019re already on Substack.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Option 4: Use a Linktree or Link-in-Bio Tool**\n\nIf you want to keep things clean and not embed a button, you can use a **Linktree** or **Link-in-bio** tool to create a simple \u201cSupport Me\u201d page with a PayPal or Buy Me a Coffee link.\n\n1. Go to [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/) or [Link in Bio](https://linkinbio.app/).\n2. Create a profile and add your donation link.\n3. Share that Linktree link in your newsletter.\n\n**Example text:**\n> Want to support this newsletter? You can do so [here](your-linktree-link).\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd27 Bonus Tip: Keep It Casual in the Newsletter\n\nOnce you have a link, you can add something like this at the end:\n\n> You can support this newsletter with a $10/year donation [here](your-link). No pressure \u2014 just a way to say thanks if you're able!\n\n---\n\nLet me know which platform you're using (PayPal, Substack, etc.), and I can help you write the exact code or link to copy-paste. You got this! \ud83d\ude0a"

      "content": "Great job on the black link \u2014 it sounds like it\u2019s looking clean and natural now! \ud83c\udf89\n\nNow, to your question: **Should you mention the donation in the subject line?**\n\nThe short answer is:  \n**No \u2014 keep the subject line focused on the newsletter content.** Here's why:\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 Why Keep the Subject Line Content-Focused\n\n- **People open emails for the content**, not the ask. If you make the subject line about money, you might scare people away or make them less likely to open.\n- You want to **build trust and warmth** first. Let your readers see the value in your newsletter before you ask for support.\n- Ending with a **soft, friendly ask** feels more genuine and less pushy \u2014 and that\u2019s what you want.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 Example of a Good Subject Line\n\nIf your newsletter is about, say, writing, cooking, or personal updates, your subject line could be:\n\n- \u201cThis week\u2019s picks: Books, music, and a recipe I\u2019m obsessed with\u201d\n- \u201cA few thoughts on [topic] and what I\u2019ve been up to\u201d\n- \u201cYour midweek reset: Tips, links, and a short story\u201d\n\nThen, at the **end** of the email, you can include your donation reminder in a warm, low-pressure way \u2014 just like you\u2019ve done.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udeab What to Avoid in the Subject Line\n\n- \u201cPlease donate to my newsletter\u201d\n- \u201cSupport me with $10/year\u201d\n- \u201cI need your help!\u201d\n\nThese can feel too direct and might make people skip the email altogether.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 Final Tip\n\nYou can still **add a hint of generosity in the subject line**, but only if it feels natural and not like a hard sell. For example:\n\n- \u201cYour favorite newsletter is still going \u2014 thanks to you!\u201d *(if it\u2019s been a while since the last ask)*\n- \u201cA little update and a small favor\u2026\u201d\n- \u201cWhat I\u2019ve been working on \u2014 and a quick note\u201d\n\nBut again, **keep it rare** and only use it if you\u2019re doing a **recurring or major ask**, not a one-off reminder.\n\n---\n\nSo, to wrap it up:  \n\u27a1\ufe0f **Subject line = about the content**  \n\u27a1\ufe0f **Body = include your soft donation reminder at the end**\n\nYou're doing this right \u2014 keep it friendly and let your readers open the email for the content, then maybe decide to support after they\u2019ve seen the value.\n\nNeed help with a subject line idea that matches your newsletter style? I\u2019m happy to help with that too! \ud83d\ude0a"

No pressure to give \u2014 I know life isn\u2019t always flush. Just being part of this little corner of the internet means more than you know.\n\n---\n\nYou can even **mix and match** or tweak it to sound more like *you*. For example, if you're a bit more casual, you could write:\n\n> P.S. If you can\u2019t swing the $10 right now, I totally get it. Just keep reading \u2014 that\u2019s support enough.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcdd Where to Put It\n\nSince you're using Mailchimp, just add this at the **very bottom**, after your sign-off, like this:\n\n```\n\u2014 [Your Name]\n\nP.S. If $10 isn\u2019t in the cards right now, no worries at all \u2014 just being a reader is more than enough. Thank you for that.\n```\n\n---\n\nThis kind of PS does a few important things:\n- **Reduces pressure** to give\n- **Welcomes all readers**, regardless of what they can give\n- **Reinforces your connection** and shows you care about more than just money\n\nYou're doing amazing work here. \ud83d\udc9b\n\nNeed help adding it into your Mailchimp draft?
