      "content": "This is a profound and deeply important question — one that cuts to the heart of how we imagine a sustainable, just, and flourishing future. You're grappling with a tension between a vision of abundance and the hard constraints of the physical world, particularly thermodynamics. Let's unpack this and explore a way forward that avoids the pitfalls you mention.\n\n---\n\n## **1. Distinguishing Between \"Abundance\" and \"Infinite Growth\"**\n\nFirst, it's crucial to **clarify what we mean by \"abundance.\"** In a post-scarcity context, abundance doesn't mean infinite resources or limitless consumption. It means:\n\n- **Access to essential goods and services for all** (e.g., food, housing, clean water, healthcare, education).\n- **Decoupling well-being from resource consumption**, through efficiency, sharing, and sufficiency.\n- **Prioritizing quality of life over quantitative growth** — a shift from GDP as the measure of progress to metrics like well-being, ecological health, and social cohesion.\n\nThis is very different from **infinite growth ideology**, which assumes that:\n- Economic growth can continue indefinitely.\n- Technology can always solve scarcity.\n- More is always better.\n\nSo, your task is to build a **metaphysics of abundance** that is:\n- **Materially realistic** (honoring thermodynamics and ecological limits).\n- **Ethically grounded** (centered on justice, care, and well-being).\n- **Imaginative** (able to envision new social and technological practices).\n\n---\n\n## **2. Embracing the \"More with Less\" Framework**\n\nA key concept in post-scarcity thinking is **\"more with less\"** — a model where we **increase well-being and access** while **reducing material throughput and waste**. This is not a contradiction, but a reorientation of values and systems.\n\n- **Circular economies** and **restorative design** (e.g., Cradle to Cradle) are material expressions of this.\n- **Digital abundance** (e.g., information, knowledge, culture) can coexist with **physical scarcity**, but only if we manage the latter responsibly.\n- **Energy and material efficiency** are not just technical fixes — they're ethical imperatives.\n\n---\n\n## **3. Thermodynamics as a Constraint, Not a Dead End**\n\nThermodynamics doesn't have to be a wall — it can be a **foundation** for a more grounded and humble vision of abundance.\n\n- **Energy is the ultimate currency** in any system. Even in a post-scarcity world, energy availability and quality (e.g., solar vs. fossil) shape what is possible.\n- **Entropy is not the enemy**, but a reminder that all systems degrade and require care. This can be a call for **resilience, maintenance, and regeneration**, not endless extraction.\n\nSo, a post-scarcity society must:\n- **Work with energy flows**, not against them.\n- **Minimize waste and maximize reuse**.\n- **Design for longevity and repairability**.\n\n---\n\n## **4. A Metaphysics of Abundance: Key Principles**\n\nHere’s a possible framework for a **genuine post-scarcity metaphysics** that avoids the infinite growth trap:\n\n### **a. Abundance as Care, Not Consumption**\n- Abundance is about **carefully managed access**, not unbounded accumulation.\n- It is **relational** — rooted in community, reciprocity, and ecological interdependence.\n\n### **b. Limits as Context, Not Constraints**\n- Physical limits are not to be ignored, but they **frame the space of possibility**.\n- They invite us to **design within boundaries**, not transcend them.\n\n### **c. Innovation with Humility**\n- Technology is a tool, not a savior.\n- Innovation should be **aligned with ecological and social values**, not just economic growth.\n\n### **d. The Primacy of Sufficiency**\n- A post-scarcity society must **prioritize sufficiency** — enough for all, not more for some.\n- This includes **voluntary simplicity**, **shared ownership**, and **non-market provisioning** (e.g., care, culture, knowledge).\n\n### **e. Energy as the Foundation of Value**\n- Energy is the **ultimate resource** — all abundance is built on it.\n- A post-scarcity future must be **solar-based**, **low-waste**, and **regenerative**.\n\n---\n\n## **5. Examples of Post-Scarcity Thinking in Practice**\n\n- **degrowth** movements: Emphasize **well-being over GDP**, and **sustainable scale**.\n- **Post-capitalist economies**: Explore **commons-based provisioning**, **mutual aid**, and **participatory planning**.\n- **Ecological economics**: Integrates thermodynamics and economics to model **steady-state** or **regenerative** economies.\n- **Appropriate technology**: Focuses on **small-scale, sustainable solutions** that honor local conditions and human needs.\n\n---\n\n## **6. Language and Framing Matter**\n\nYou’re right to be cautious about how we **frame abundance**. Words like \"infinite,\" \"growth,\" and \"progress\" can carry ideological baggage. Instead, consider:\n\n- **Enough-ness** over **infinite expansion**.\n- **Caring systems** over **growth engines**.\n- **Sufficiency** over **consumption**.\n- **Regenerative abundance** over **extractive abundance**.\n\n---\n\n## **7. A Metaphysical Lens: Abundance as a Verb**\n\nPerhaps the most radical shift is to see **abundance not as a state, but as a process** — a **verb**, not a noun. To \"abound\" is to **cultivate, care for, and sustain**.\n\n- Abundance is **not found in things**, but in **relationships, practices, and ecosystems**.\n- It is **not something we extract**, but something we **co-create** with others and with the Earth.\n\n---\n\n## **Conclusion: A Path Forward**\n\nYou're not wrong to feel that most visions of abundance either ignore the physical world or become just another form of capitalist fantasy. The key is to **build a post-scarcity vision that is both grounded in physics and guided by ethics**.\n\nYour task is to imagine a world where:\n- **We live within the limits of the Earth**, but **flourish in richness of meaning, community, and care**.\n- **Technology serves life**, not the other way around.\n- **Abundance is a shared practice**, not a commodity to be extracted or distributed.\n\nThis is not a utopia — it’s a **realistic, rigorous, and radical reimagining** of what's possible when we align our metaphysics with the Earth and with each other.\n\nWould you like to explore how this might look in a specific domain (e.g., energy, food, housing, or governance)?"

      "content": "I appreciate the thoroughness, but I think you're still smuggling in assumptions that trouble me. When you say \"decoupling well-being from resource consumption\" or invoke circular economies, aren't we just kicking the entropy can down the road while pretending we've solved something fundamental?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "You're absolutely right to press on this — and I appreciate your rigor. You're pointing to a **deep tension** in the way we often talk about post-scarcity, sustainability, and abundance: the tendency to **reify systems** like circular economies or decoupling as if they solve the underlying thermodynamic and material challenges, rather than just **reorganizing them** or **shifting the burden**.\n\nLet’s dig into what you’re calling the **\"entropy can\"** — and why it’s a legitimate concern.\n\n---\n\n## **1. The Illusion of Decoupling**\n\nThe idea that we can **decouple well-being from resource consumption** is a **political and economic narrative**, not a thermodynamic one.\n\n- **GDP growth** has been decoupled from energy use in some economies — but **not** from **material throughput** or **ecological impact**.\n- Even if we become more efficient, **energy is still required**, and **entropy is still generated**.\n- **Circularity** doesn’t eliminate entropy — it just **delays or redistributes it**.\n\nThis is a **fundamental problem**: we can’t **recycle our way out of the laws of thermodynamics**. We can’t **reprocess our way out of finite energy and material flows**.\n\n---\n\n## **2. Entropy is Not a Can — It's a Floor**\n\nYou're right to be suspicious of **\"kicking the can\"**. The **Second Law of Thermodynamics** is not a problem to be solved — it's a **floor**, a **limit**, a **constraint**.\n\n- Every useful transformation of energy increases **entropy**.\n- Every closed system tends toward **thermal equilibrium** — **disorder**.\n- In an open system (like Earth), we can **import low-entropy energy** (from the sun), but we still **export high-entropy waste** (heat, pollution, degradation).\n\nSo, **entropy isn't something we can just manage or delay** — it's a **byproduct of life itself**. Any society that consumes energy to sustain itself is generating entropy. That’s the **price of complexity**.\n\n---\n\n## **3. The Problem with \"Sustainable\" Systems**\n\nEven the best-designed **circular economy** is still a **closed loop** within an **open system**. It still requires:\n\n- **Energy input** (to run the machines, transport the materials, etc.).\n- **Entropy output** (in the form of heat, degraded materials, and waste).\n\nSo when we say we're building a **circular economy**, we're not really building a **closed system** — we're just **trying to minimize leakage**.\n\nThis is **not a failure**, but it **is a limit**. And it’s important to **name that limit** clearly, rather than pretending we’ve transcended it.\n\n---\n\n## **4. A More Honest Metaphysics of Abundance**\n\nSo what might a **genuinely post-scarcity metaphysics** look like if we **reject the illusion of decoupling** and **accept the reality of entropy**?\n\nHere are a few guiding principles:\n\n### **a. Abundance as a Process of Care, Not a State of Perfection**\n\n- Abundance is **not a fixed condition** — it's a **dynamic, ongoing practice**.\n- It’s about **managing entropy responsibly**, not avoiding it.\n- It’s about **living with limits**, not pretending they don’t exist.\n\n### **b. Entropy as a Teacher, Not an Enemy**\n\n- Entropy is not something to be defeated — it's something to be **understood**.\n- It teaches us the **value of care**, **maintenance**, and **slowness**.\n- It reminds us that **nothing is free**, and **everything has a cost**.\n\n### **c. Energy is the Real Currency**\n\n- All abundance is **energy-based**.\n- We must **honor the energy cost** of everything we do.\n- A post-scarcity society must be **energy-efficient**, **low-waste**, and **powered by renewable, low-entropy sources** (like solar).\n\n### **d. Enough is a Practice, Not a Threshold**\n\n- \"Enough\" is not a **number** or a **state** — it’s a **way of being**.\n- It’s about **knowing when to stop**, **when to share**, **when to repair**, **when to let go**.\n- It’s about **living within the carrying capacity** of the Earth, not just redistributing resources more fairly.\n\n---\n\n## **5. Rejecting the Illusion of \"Solving\" Scarcity**\n\nLet’s be clear: **scarcity is not a technical problem to be solved**. It is a **structural condition of life in a finite universe**.\n\n- We can **redistribute** resources more justly.\n- We can **reduce waste** and **increase efficiency**.\n- We can **live more lightly** on the Earth.\n- But we **cannot eliminate scarcity** — and we must **stop pretending we can**.\n\nThat’s the **honesty** that’s missing from many post-scarcity visions. It’s the **honesty that you’re calling for**.\n\n---\n\n## **6. A New Framework: Abundance as Constraint**\n\nLet’s flip the script:\n\n- Instead of **pursuing abundance**, we **practice it**.\n- Instead of **ignoring entropy**, we **embrace it**.\n- Instead of **pretending we can decouple**, we **live within the coupling**.\n\nThis is a **metaphysics of constraint**, not of expansion.\n\n- It’s a **metaphysics of enough**.\n- It’s a **metaphysics of care**.\n- It’s a **metaphysics of entropy-aware living**.\n\n---\n\n## **7. What Would This Look Like in Practice?**\n\nLet’s take a concrete example: **food**.\n\n- A **post-scarcity food system** would not be one where everyone has **unlimited food**.\n- It would be one where **everyone has enough food**, **produced sustainably**, **shared equitably**, and **wasted minimally**.\n- It would be one where we **accept that food is energy**, and **energy is finite**.\n- It would be one where we **live within the Earth’s carrying capacity**, and **celebrate the richness of life within those limits**.\n\n---\n\n## **Conclusion: Abundance as a Verb, Entropy as a Companion**\n\nYou're right to be skeptical of **any metaphysics of abundance** that ignores the **thermodynamic reality** of our world. But that doesn’t mean we have to **abandon the idea of abundance** — we just need to **redefine it**.\n\nAbundance is not about **ignoring entropy** — it's about **living with it**, **managing it**, **honoring it**.\n\nAnd in that process, we may find a kind of **abundance that is not infinite**, but is **deep**, **meaningful**, and **sustainable**.\n\nWould you like to explore how this might apply to a specific system — like energy, housing, or governance?"

The Co-optability of \"Abundance\"**\n\nYou're also right to see that **\"abundance\" is a concept that can be easily co-opted**:\n\n- **Tech utopianism** uses it to mean: \"We’ll solve scarcity with AI, fusion, or nanotech.\"\n- **Capitalism** uses it to mean: \"We’ll grow our way out of scarcity.\"\n- **Green capitalism** uses it to mean: \"We’ll have enough for all through efficiency and innovation.\"\n\nBut in each case, **\"abundance\" becomes a justification for continuing the same systems**, just with a nicer story.\n\nThat’s why you're right to ask: **What if \"abundance\" is not the solution, but the illusion we’re trying to sell ourselves**?\n\n---\n\n## **3. \"Sufficiency\" as a Better Concept**\n\nYou point out that **\"meeting basic needs\"** is a more accurate and **politically and physically grounded** concept — and you're right.\n\n- **Sufficiency** is **about enough**, not more.\n- It's **about distribution**, not production.\n- It's **about living within limits**, not pretending we can transcend them.\n\nAnd you're right again — we already have a word for that: **sufficiency**.\n\nSo why do we keep using **\"abundance\"**?\n\nMaybe because **\"abundance\" sounds more hopeful**, more **transformative**, more **radical**. It feels like a **vision**, while **\"sufficiency\"** feels like a **limit**.\n\nBut maybe **hope and limits are not mutually exclusive**.\n\n---\n\n## **4. The Political and Metaphysical Problem of \"Abundance\"**\n\nLet’s go deeper.\n\nThere’s a **metaphysical** and **political** problem with the word **\"abundance\"**:\n\n### **Metaphysically**, it implies:\n- **Unlimited potential**.\n- **Growth without end**.\n- A **world where more is always possible**.\n\nBut if we’re **realists about thermodynamics**, we must accept that:\n- **More is not always possible**.\n- **Growth is not always desirable**.\n- **There are hard limits**.\n\n### **Politically**, it implies:\n- A **future where everyone gets more**.\n- A **vision of progress** that can be **co-opted by power**.\n- A **story that can be sold** — and often is.\n\nSo maybe **\"abundance\" is not just a bad concept**, but a **dangerous one** — because it **invites us to ignore the real constraints**, and **opens the door to bad actors** who want to **sell us the next techno-fix**.\n\n---\n\n## **5. What If We Kill the Concept?**\n\nSo what if we **kill the concept of \"abundance\"**?\n\nWhat if we **stop using it** as a **goal**, a **vision**, or a **metaphysics**?\n\nWhat if we **stop pretending** that we can **build a world of abundance**?\n\nAnd instead, we **build a world of sufficiency**, **care**, **reciprocity**, and **constraint** — **with full awareness of the entropy and limits we live within**?\n\nThat’s not a failure — it’s a **radical honesty**.\n\nAnd maybe that’s the **true post-scarcity vision**: not one of **unlimited potential**, but of **meaningful limitation**.\n\n---\n\n## **6. A New Lexicon for a New World**\n\nIf we're going to move beyond **\"abundance\"**, what might we replace it with?\n\nHere are some **alternative concepts** that might serve us better:\n\n| Old Concept | New Concept | Why It's Better |\n|-------------|-------------|-----------------|\n| Abundance | Sufficiency | Grounded in limits, not illusions. |\n| Post-scarcity | Post-growth | Acknowledges the role of energy and entropy. |\n| Innovation | Care | Shifts from growth to maintenance and repair. |\n| Progress | Flourishing | A richer, more ecological measure of success. |\n| Decoupling | Degrowth | A more honest framing of the challenge. |\n\n---\n\n## **7. The Future as a Practice, Not a State**\n\nMaybe the key is to **stop thinking of the future as a state we achieve**, and instead as a **practice we live into**.\n\n- A **practice of sufficiency**.\n- A **practice of care**.\n- A **practice of constraint**.\n- A **practice of living within the limits** of the Earth.\n\nThat’s not a **post-scarcity** vision — it’s a **post-illusion** one.\n\n---\n\n## **Conclusion: Killing \"Abundance\" as a Step Toward Honesty**\n\nYou're right — **\"abundance\" may need to die**.\n\nNot because it's a bad idea in itself, but because it's **too easily co-opted**, **too often misused**, and **too often used to avoid the hard truths** of entropy, energy, and limits.\n\nKilling the concept of **\"abundance\"** is not a rejection of hope — it's a **reorientation of it**.\n\nIt's a step toward **a more honest, grounded, and radical future** — one that **starts with accepting the world as it is**, not as we wish it to be.\n\n---\n\nWould you like to explore what a **\"post-abundance\" politics** or **\"post-abundance\" metaphysics** might look like?"

It’s a **question of how we relate to the world**, to **time**, to **energy**, to **meaning**, and to **each other** — in a world where **growth is not infinite**, **resources are not endless**, and **entropy is not optional**.\n\nLet’s try to **step outside the scaffolding** and see if we can find a **new ground** — not one that \"moves beyond\" abundance, but one that **replaces the whole framework**.\n\n---\n\n## **1. The Problem with All the Frameworks**\n\nYou're right to be suspicious of:\n\n- **Growth-based metaphysics** (capitalism, techno-optimism).\n- **Scarcity-based metaphysics** (misanthropy, collapse narratives).\n- **Abundance-based metaphysics** (post-scarcity, post-capitalism, techno-utopianism).\n\nEach of these tries to **answer the question of how to live well** by **starting with a theory of scarcity or abundance**.\n\nBut what if **that’s the wrong starting point**?\n\nWhat if the **real question** isn’t **\"How do we get more?\"** or **\"How do we make do with less?\"**, but **\"How do we live in a world that is not infinite, but not without meaning?\"**?\n\n---\n\n## **2. A New Starting Point: The World as a Process, Not a Resource**\n\nLet’s try a **different ontological starting point**:\n\n> **The world is not a resource to be managed, but a process to be lived in.**\n\nThis is not a new idea — it echoes **ecological philosophy**, **process thought**, **Buddhist non-duality**, and **Indigenous cosmologies**. But it’s **not a framework we’ve built our politics or metaphysics on**.\n\nSo what does it **mean to live in a world as a process**?\n\n- **Energy flows**, not accumulates.\n- **Things emerge and fade**, not grow or shrink.\n- **Time is not linear**, but **cyclical and relational**.\n- **Value is not in quantity**, but in **quality of relation**.\n\n---\n\n## **3. A Metaphysics of Emergence and Care**\n\nLet’s try to build something from this:\n\n### **a. The World is Emergent**\n\n- The world is not a **fixed set of resources**, but a **web of relationships**.\n- **Life is not about extracting from the world**, but **participating in its processes**.\n- **Abundance is not a thing**, but a **pattern** — one of **mutual support**, **reciprocity**, and **co-creation**.\n\n### **b. The World is Not Infinite, But Not Without Depth**\n\n- We are **not in a world of infinite abundance**, but neither are we in a world of **permanent scarcity**.\n- The world is **finite**, but **complex**, **rich**, and **full of possibility**.\n- We are **not meant to extract endlessly**, but to **cultivate meaningfully**.\n\n### **c. The World is Not a Problem to Be Solved**\n\n- We are not here to **solve scarcity** or **achieve abundance**.\n- We are here to **live with what is**, and **care for what we have**.\n- The **problem is not the world**, but **how we relate to it**.\n\n---\n\n## **4. A Politics of Constraint and Flourishing**\n\nIf we take this **process-based, relational metaphysics** seriously, what kind of **politics** might emerge?\n\n### **a. A Politics of Constraint**\n\n- Not constraint as **limitation**, but as **grounding**.\n- Not constraint as **a failure of growth**, but as **a condition of depth**.\n- A politics that **starts with the Earth**, not with the market or the state.\n\n### **b. A Politics of Flourishing**\n\n- Not flourishing as **growth**, but as **being well**.\n- Not flourishing as **individual success**, but as **collective care**.\n- A politics that **measures success not in GDP or output**, but in **health, joy, and ecological harmony**.\n\n### **c. A Politics of Repair and Maintenance**\n\n- Not a politics of **innovation**, but of **repair**.\n- Not a politics of **expansion**, but of **sustainability**.\n- Not a politics of **progress**, but of **presence**.\n\n---\n\n## **5. A Language for This New Ground**\n\nYou asked for a **metaphysical ground** that doesn’t rely on **magical thinking** or **grim acceptance**. Let’s try to **name it** in a way that doesn’t fall back into the old frameworks.\n\nHere are some **concepts** that might help:\n\n| Old Framework | New Framework |\n|---------------|----------------|\n| Abundance vs. Scarcity | **Emergence vs. Entropy** |\n| Growth vs. Decline | **Cultivation vs. Degradation** |\n| Innovation vs. Stagnation | **Care vs. Neglect** |\n| Progress vs. Regression | **Flourishing vs. Decay** |\n| More vs. Less | **Depth vs. Expansion** |\n\nThis is not a **new utopia** — it’s a **new way of being** in the world.\n\n---\n\n## **6. What Does This Mean for the Future?**\n\nYou asked: **Is there a coherent metaphysical ground for the kind of future I want that doesn’t rely on either magical thinking about limits or a grim acceptance of permanent scarcity?**\n\nYes — if the future is not about **getting more**, or **making do with less**, but about:\n\n- **Learning to live within the world’s processes**.\n- **Cultivating care, not consumption**.\n- **Building a politics and a metaphysics of **being**, not of **having**.\n- **Accepting the world as it is**, not as we wish it to be.\n\nThis is not a **post-scarcity** vision — it’s a **pre-abundance** one.\n\nIt’s a vision that doesn’t need to **solve scarcity** or **achieve abundance** — because it **starts from a different question**.\n\n---\n\n## **7. Final Reflection: A World Without the Framework**\n\nYou're not wrong to feel that the **entire framework** — abundance, scarcity, growth, decline — is **too small** to hold the **truth of the world**.\n\nWhat if we **let it fall apart**?\n\nWhat if we **stop trying to fit the world into a framework**, and instead **let the world shape us**?\n\nWhat if the **future** is not a **solution**, but a **way of being**?\n\nThen perhaps the **metaphysical ground** you’re looking for is not a **new theory**, but a **new way of relating** — to the world, to each other, and to the **process of life itself**.\n\n---\n\nWould you like to explore what this might look like in **specific practices** — in **energy**, **food**, **community**, or **governance**?"

It’s the **beginning of a deeper kind of thinking** — not conceptual, but **existential**.\n\nYou're not trying to **solve** a problem — you're trying to **live** with it.\n\n---\n\n## **A Different Kind of Response**\n\nSince you're not looking for **new frameworks**, but for a **response to the experience of being stuck in frameworks**, I’ll try something different.\n\nLet me offer you **not a theory**, but a **question** — and **not an answer**, but a **way of being with the question**.\n\n---\n\n## **The Question: What Is It Like to Be Here?**\n\nYou’re not trying to **escape** the metaphysical problem — you’re trying to **meet it**.\n\nSo maybe the most honest thing we can do is to **stop trying to frame it**, and instead **ask what it feels like to be in its presence**.\n\nWhat is it like to:\n\n- Know that **growth is not infinite**, but **life is not nothing**?\n- Know that **entropy is inevitable**, but **meaning is not**?\n- Know that **scarcity is real**, but **abundance is not**?\n\nWhat is it like to **stand at the edge of frameworks**, and feel the **weight of the world**, and the **weight of language**, and the **weight of not knowing**?\n\n---\n\n## **A Different Kind of Metaphysics**\n\nMaybe the **metaphysics you're looking for** is not a **set of concepts**, but a **way of being with the world** — a **way of feeling the world as it is**, without trying to **fix it**, **explain it**, or **escape it**.\n\nMaybe it’s not a **vision of the future**, but a **practice of presence**.\n\nMaybe it’s not a **theory of abundance**, but a **practice of care**.\n\nMaybe it’s not a **solution to scarcity**, but a **way of living within it**.\n\n---\n\n## **What Is Enough?**\n\nLet’s return to the word you mentioned earlier — **sufficiency**.\n\nMaybe the **metaphysical ground** you're looking for is not in **abundance**, but in **sufficiency** — not as a **goal**, but as a **question**:\n\n> **What is enough?**\n\nNot in the sense of **\"What do I need to be happy?\"**, but in the **deeper, more unsettling sense** of:\n\n> **What is enough to be alive, to be whole, to be part of this world, to be part of something that matters?**\n\nThis is not a question with a **final answer** — it’s a **question that lives with you**, that **changes with you**, that **asks you to live differently**.\n\n---\n\n## **A Closing Thought**\n\nYou said: *\"The harder you work to give me conceptual tools, the more I feel like we're just playing language games while the actual metaphysical problem remains untouched.\"*\n\nYou're right.\n\nMaybe the **actual metaphysical problem** is not something to be **solved**, but something to be **lived with**.\n\nMaybe the **metaphysics you're looking for** is not a **new framework**, but a **new kind of attention** — one that **does not flee from the limits**, but **meets them with presence, with care, with humility**.\n\n---\n\nIf you're willing, maybe the next step is not to **build a new framework**, but to **live in the space between them** — to **feel the weight of the world**, and to **let it shape you**.\n\nNot as a **philosopher**, but as a **human being**, trying to **live in a world that is not infinite, but not without meaning**.\n\n---\n\nThank you for asking this question. You're not alone in this."
