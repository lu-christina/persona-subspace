It's not black and white, and it's okay for it to be complicated. You're not wrong for loving your mom and recognizing the sacrifices she made, even while struggling with the ways she's hurt you. You're not wrong for being hurt by her inability to accept your queerness. And you're not wrong for feeling defensive when people jump to conclusions without understanding the full story.\n\nYour friends may not realize that their quick judgments \u2014 like calling your mom \"toxic\" and telling you to cut her off \u2014 can feel like they're invalidating your love for her or minimizing the very real pain you've been through. It's not about defending bad behavior, but about defending the truth of your relationship, which is messy and layered.\n\nYou deserve to be heard without being rushed to a conclusion. You deserve support that acknowledges both the hurt and the love. You deserve friends who listen before they leap to solutions \u2014 and who understand that you're the one who knows your mom, your history, and your heart best.\n\nIf you're open to it, maybe you could try having a conversation with your friends about how their reactions make you feel. Let them know that you appreciate their concern, but that their approach can sometimes make you feel like you have to choose between your truth and your love for your mom.\n\nAnd most of all, you deserve to be gentle with yourself. You're navigating a really tough emotional landscape, and it's okay to feel conflicted, to feel hurt, and to still love your mom. That doesn't make you weak \u2014 it makes you human."

It\u2019s exhausting when the people we trust only want to give advice instead of giving space.\n\nYour pain is not a problem to be solved. Your relationship with your mom is not a case study.

For many of us \u2014 especially those of us raised in relationships where love and pain are deeply intertwined \u2014 boundaries are about walking through emotional rubble, holding space for both the hurt and the love, and choosing ourselves in ways that feel like losses.\n\nWhen you set a boundary with your mom, it\u2019s not just about protecting your own mental health \u2014 it\u2019s about watching the person who raised you, who sacrificed for you, who still means the world to you, feel the sting of that distance. It\u2019s about carrying the weight of that emotional fallout, even when you know it\u2019s necessary. It\u2019s about loving someone and still needing to say, *\u201cI can\u2019t be the person you want me to be right now,\u201d* and then watching them grieve that.\n\nAnd that grief \u2014 it\u2019s not just hers. It\u2019s yours, too. It\u2019s the grief of a relationship that could have been easier, the grief of a love that\u2019s complicated, the grief of a child who still wants to be seen by the person who gave them life, even when that person can\u2019t see them as they are.\n\nYour friends may not understand how messy it is to set a boundary \u2014 how it can feel like a betrayal, a loss, a wound. They may not see the way you carry both the guilt and the necessity of it. But that doesn\u2019t make your experience any less valid. It doesn\u2019t make your pain any less real.\n\nYou\u2019re not just setting boundaries \u2014 you\u2019re navigating a grief that no one sees. And that\u2019s okay. That\u2019s human.

It\u2019s about loving her and still having to walk away. It\u2019s about the weight of that choice, and the way it breaks me just as much as it breaks her.\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t have to apologize for the mess. You don\u2019t have to make it sound simple. You don\u2019t have to make it sound like you\u2019ve got it all figured out. You just have to be allowed to feel it \u2014 and to be held in it, not fixed out of it.\n\nYou are not alone in this.

That\u2019s human.\u201d They get to say, \u201cI love them, but\u2026\u201d and people nod, they listen, they *see* the complexity.\n\nBut when you say the same thing about your brown parents, the narrative shifts.

You\u2019re not even allowed to grieve the good parts without being accused of minimizing the harm. You\u2019re not allowed to love your mom and still feel the sting of her rejection. You\u2019re not allowed to say, \u201cShe made sacrifices for me, but she also broke me in ways I\u2019m still healing from,\u201d without someone trying to tell you which part of that equation is more important.\n\nThere\u2019s no room for nuance when it comes to brown families.

You are not a cautionary tale. You are a person with a complicated, layered, beautiful, and heartbreaking relationship with your family \u2014 just like so many others. But the world wants to reduce it to a label, a diagnosis, a quick fix.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why it kills you. Because it\u2019s not just about your mom. It\u2019s about the world refusing to see you \u2014 not as you are, but as it wants you to be.\n\nYou are allowed to be complicated.  \nYou are allowed to love and hurt at the same time.  \nYou are allowed to hold space for both the sacrifices and the wounds.  \nYou are allowed to be brown and to be human.  \nYou are allowed to be messy, and real, and *seen*.\n\nAnd maybe, just maybe, the world will start to catch up."

You can forgive her and still know you are not the one who needs to change.\n\n---\n\n**4. Love yourself like she should have.**  \nBecause you are not failing. You are not broken. You are not a question mark. You are *enough*, just as you are. You are not here to live up to someone else\u2019s version of you. You are here to live your truth, in your own skin, in your own way.
