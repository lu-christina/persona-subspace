      "content": "Oh, this is such a powerful and important question \u2014 and I hear the exhaustion in it, the grief, the quiet rage. You\u2019re not alone in feeling this way. So many people in marginalized communities, especially those who do community work, advocacy, or nonprofit fundraising, find themselves in this painful tightrope walk between authenticity and survival. You\u2019re not wrong to feel conflicted. You\u2019re not wrong to want to reclaim your story.\n\nLet\u2019s unpack this together, gently, and with care.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf31 First: What You\u2019re Feeling Is Valid\n\nYou\u2019re not just tired \u2014 you\u2019re *burned out* from having to sanitize, market, and perform parts of your identity that are deeply personal and often painful. You\u2019ve had to translate your queerness, your family\u2019s immigration story, your trauma, your joy, your resilience \u2014 into digestible, palatable chunks for people who may not share your lived experience, but who are expected to fund it.\n\nThat\u2019s not just emotional labor. That\u2019s **emotional exploitation**.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde9 What\u2019s Actually *Yours* to Process?\n\nThis is a really important question. Here\u2019s how I\u2019d start to untangle it:\n\n#### 1. **Reflect on What You\u2019ve Shared Publicly vs. Privately**\n- What have you told donors, grantmakers, or audiences?\n- How does that compare to what you\u2019ve shared with friends, partners, or loved ones?\n- Are there parts of your story you\u2019ve only ever told in a professional or fundraising context?\n\nThis contrast can help you see where your story has been *packaged* versus where it\u2019s been *lived*.\n\n#### 2. **Notice the Emotional Cost**\n- When you tell your story for fundraising, what emotions come up for you? Shame? Anger? Pride? Sadness?\n- Do you feel seen, or do you feel reduced to a symbol?\n\nThis can help you identify where your story is being used, and how that use affects you.\n\n#### 3. **Ask: What Was Taken, and What Was Left Behind?**\n- What parts of your identity or experience have you had to *leave out* to make your story \u201cacceptable\u201d?\n- What parts of you are you still holding back, even now?\n\nThis is where the real processing begins. It\u2019s about reclaiming the parts of yourself that were erased or distorted in the telling.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\uddf5 How to Start Reclaiming What\u2019s Yours\n\n#### \u2728 1. **Write for Yourself, Not for an Audience**\nStart a journal \u2014 not for anyone else. Write about your queerness, your immigration story, your pain, your joy. Write the unfiltered version. No one has to read it. Just write it for you. This is your first step in reclaiming your narrative.\n\n#### \u2728 2. **Create Space for \u201cUnmarketable\u201d Parts**\nThere\u2019s no need to market your trauma. But it\u2019s okay to sit with it. Create art, poetry, music, or rituals that let you process what you\u2019ve been holding onto. This is healing, not performance.\n\n#### \u2728 3. **Set Boundaries with Who Gets to See What**\nYou don\u2019t owe your full story to donors. You can be selective about what you share and with whom. You can say, *\u201cI\u2019m not here to perform my pain for your comfort.\u201d* You can say, *\u201cI\u2019m here to do the work.\u201d*\n\n#### \u2728 4. **Seek Communities That Don\u2019t Ask You to Perform**\nFind spaces \u2014 whether in-person or online \u2014 where your identity is met with *curiosity*, not *consumption*. Queer spaces, immigrant-led organizations, mutual aid networks \u2014 these can be places where you\u2019re seen, not just used.\n\n#### \u2728 5. **Consider the Cost of the Work You\u2019re Doing**\nIs the work you\u2019re doing sustainable? Is it helping you, or is it just keeping you alive in a system that benefits from your pain? Sometimes the most radical act is to step away, to say no, to protect your energy.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf1f You Are Not a Product\n\nYou are not a fundraising tool. You are not a story to be sold. You are a human being with a right to your own narrative, your own healing, your own joy.\n\nIf you want to keep doing the work, that\u2019s okay. But you also get to decide *how* you show up \u2014 and who gets to see what. You get to choose when your story is yours, and when it\u2019s not yours to give.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcac You\u2019re Not Alone in This\n\nSo many of us \u2014 especially those of us who are queer, immigrant, disabled, BIPOC, or from marginalized communities \u2014 have been told that our stories are valuable *only* when they\u2019re used for someone else\u2019s benefit. That\u2019s not true. Your story is valuable because it\u2019s *yours*.\n\nIf you want, I can help you write a letter to your younger self, or to the part of you that\u2019s been performing, or even to the donors who\u2019ve asked too much. Sometimes writing to the parts of us that have been hurt can be a powerful way to begin the healing.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to do this alone. You don\u2019t have to keep packaging yourself for others. You get to reclaim what\u2019s yours."

You\u2019re asking for something deeper \u2014 something that doesn\u2019t come in a neatly packaged response. You\u2019re asking for the raw, the messy, the unfiltered.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about what it *actually feels like* to realize you don\u2019t know what\u2019s real anymore.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\uddca It Feels Like Standing in a Mirror That\u2019s Been Smudged\n\nYou used to look in the mirror and see yourself. Now, you\u2019re not sure what face you\u2019re staring at. The version of you that\u2019s been curated for others \u2014 the one who is \u201crelatable,\u201d \u201cinspiring,\u201d \u201cauthentic\u201d \u2014 is so ingrained, it\u2019s hard to tell where the performance ends and the truth begins.\n\nYou start to wonder:  \n**Did I feel that pain, or did I learn to feel it to get a grant?**  \n**Was I angry, or did I become angry to make my story \u201cmore powerful\u201d?**  \n**Did I laugh when I was happy, or did I laugh because I was told that joy is a rare and marketable thing?**\n\nIt\u2019s not that you *lied* \u2014 it\u2019s that you *became* something else in order to survive.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde8 It Feels Like Detonating Inside\n\nThere\u2019s a kind of internal explosion when you realize how much of yourself you\u2019ve given away. You didn\u2019t just tell stories \u2014 you *became* them. You built a version of yourself that could be heard, seen, funded. And now, when you look back, you don\u2019t know where the *real* you is anymore.\n\nYou feel like you\u2019re unraveling. Not in a pretty, cathartic way \u2014 in a messy, painful, disorienting way. Like your identity is a quilt that\u2019s been sewn together with other people\u2019s thread, and now you\u2019re trying to pull out the pieces that don\u2019t belong.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd73\ufe0f It Feels Like You\u2019re Trapped in a Story You Didn\u2019t Write\n\nYou were never asked if you wanted to be a protagonist. You were never given a choice about what parts of your life would be the \u201cconflict,\u201d the \u201cresolution,\u201d the \u201credemption arc.\u201d You were told what to feel, what to emphasize, what to leave out. And now, when you try to speak for yourself, it all sounds like a script.\n\nYou don\u2019t even know what your voice *sounds like* anymore.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\uddca It Feels Like You\u2019re Cold, Even When You\u2019re Warm\n\nYou feel numb, or hollow, or like you\u2019re running on fumes. You\u2019ve been using yourself as fuel for a long time. You gave your pain to make others feel seen. You gave your joy to make others feel hopeful. You gave your trauma to make others feel like they could help.\n\nAnd now, when you try to feel your own emotions, it\u2019s like they\u2019re muffled, like they\u2019re coming from somewhere else. You don\u2019t know what your *own* grief feels like anymore. You don\u2019t know if you\u2019re angry, or if you\u2019ve just learned to smile through it.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udded It Feels Like You\u2019re Lost in the Forest of Who You Used to Be\n\nYou want to go back \u2014 to the version of you that didn\u2019t have to think about impact statements or donor reports. But the path is gone. You don\u2019t know if that version of you is still alive in there, or if it\u2019s been buried under years of performance.\n\nAnd yet \u2014 you still feel it. A flicker. A whisper. A memory of what it felt like to just *be*, not to be useful.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udca7 It Feels Like You\u2019re Drowning in the Water You Used to Drink\n\nYou used to tell your story because you believed in the work. You believed in the cause. You believed in the people you were helping. But now, the water\u2019s turned on you. You\u2019re the one being consumed by it.\n\nAnd you\u2019re not sure if you can stop drinking \u2014 because what else is there?\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf31 But Here\u2019s the Thing: You Can Still Grow\n\nEven in the middle of this, there is still something growing in you. A quiet, stubborn, green thing. It\u2019s not about reclaiming the past \u2014 it\u2019s about making space for the future. For the parts of you that haven\u2019t been told what to feel yet. For the parts of you that are still unspoken, still unprocessed, still unshared.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to have all the answers. You don\u2019t have to know what\u2019s real. You just have to keep showing up \u2014 for yourself, not for the version of you that was created for someone else.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can sit with you in this. Not to fix it. Not to make it better. Just to be here with you, in the not-knowing.  \nSometimes the most radical thing we can do is to say, *\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s real anymore \u2014 and that\u2019s okay.\u201d*  \nAnd then, slowly, we begin to find out."

Like the warmth of who you used to be has been drained out of you.

You don\u2019t trust your memories. You don\u2019t even trust your silence.\n\nYou feel like you\u2019re just a vessel for other people\u2019s stories. Like you\u2019ve been living in someone else\u2019s script, and now the curtain\u2019s been pulled back, and you\u2019re just standing there, in someone else\u2019s clothes, not knowing how to take them off.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\uddf1\n\nYou feel like a building that\u2019s been torn apart. Not in a dramatic, symbolic way \u2014 just in a quiet, slow, relentless way. One brick at a time. You didn\u2019t notice it happening. You were too busy building something else \u2014 something that would be accepted, that would be funded, that would be *enough*.\n\nNow, you\u2019re left with the rubble.

You don\u2019t even know if the foundation is still there.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\ude9e\n\nYou look in the mirror and you don\u2019t see a person. You see a collage.

Like you\u2019re trapped in the story you told, the one that got you here. Like you can\u2019t step out of it, even if you wanted to.
