It sounds like this nightmare touched on some really sensitive parts of your identity and how you see yourself in relation to your family and their expectations.\n\nThe fact that you woke up crying and felt a part of you believes your abuela\u2019s words shows how much you care about her approval, and how much you might be struggling with your own sense of self-worth. That kind of emotional pain is real and valid.\n\nLet me say this clearly: **You are not a disgrace.** Your identity, your desires, your choices\u2014none of them make you less worthy of love, respect, or belonging. Family dynamics can be complicated, and it\u2019s not your job to live up to someone else\u2019s idea of what you should be. You are allowed to be exactly who you are, even if it doesn\u2019t fit into someone else\u2019s version of \u201cnormal.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re open to it, maybe this dream could be a starting point for some healing. It might help to talk to someone you trust\u2014whether that\u2019s a friend, a therapist, or even someone in the LGBTQ+ community who understands what you\u2019re going through. You deserve support, and you deserve to feel safe in your own skin.\n\nYou\u2019re not alone in this. \ud83d\udc9b"

      "content": "I hear you. So much. That kind of shame\u2014especially the kind that\u2019s been handed down through generations, through religion, through family expectations\u2014doesn\u2019t just sit on the surface. It **gets under your skin**. It\u2019s not just something you can \u201cdecide\u201d to believe or not believe. It\u2019s a whole system of beliefs that\u2019s been reinforced for years, maybe even before you were old enough to question it.\n\nYou\u2019re not wrong to feel like it\u2019s baked into your DNA. It *is*, in a way. Not literally, obviously, but emotionally, culturally, spiritually. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so hard to shake. It\u2019s not just your thoughts\u2014it\u2019s a **legacy** of silence, of fear, of \u201cshoulds\u201d and \u201cmusts.\u201d And that legacy is real. It\u2019s not your fault it exists, and it\u2019s not your fault it hurts.\n\nSo maybe the question isn\u2019t *how do I separate what I think from what was programmed into me*, but **how do I start to untangle it**\u2014gently, patiently, with compassion for yourself?\n\nHere are a few thoughts that might help:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Shame is not truth.**\nIt\u2019s easy to confuse the two. Shame tells you *you\u2019re bad*. But that\u2019s not the same as *you are bad*. Shame is a feeling. It\u2019s not a fact. It\u2019s not who you are. You are not the sum of your shame.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Name the voice.**\nWhen you hear that voice in your head that says \u201cyou\u2019re a disgrace,\u201d try to name it. \u201cThat\u2019s not me. That\u2019s the voice of Catholic guilt. That\u2019s the voice of fear. That\u2019s the voice of a culture that tried to tell me I was wrong to exist.\u201d Naming it can take away some of its power.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **You are not your abuela\u2019s values.**\nEven if she loves you, even if she\u2019s been a big part of your life, her values are not your values. You are not obligated to carry the weight of her shame or her expectations. You get to choose what to hold onto and what to let go of.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Healing is not linear.**\nYou might believe you\u2019re free from the guilt one day, and then something\u2014like a dream, or a comment, or a memory\u2014triggers it all again. That\u2019s okay. Healing is not a straight line. It\u2019s more like a spiral. You go around the same issues, but each time you\u2019re a little wiser, a little more resilient.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **You can rewrite your story.**\nYou can\u2019t change the past, but you can decide how it shapes your future. Every time you choose to be who you are\u2014out, proud, queer, sexual, whatever you are\u2014you\u2019re not just living your truth. You\u2019re also rewriting the narrative for the next generation. You\u2019re breaking the cycle.\n\n---\n\nIf you can, consider reaching out to a **therapist who specializes in queer issues** or **intergenerational trauma**. Sometimes, having someone to sit with you and help you untangle these things can make all the difference. You don\u2019t have to do it alone.\n\nAnd if you ever need to talk, I\u2019m here. You\u2019re not alone in this. You\u2019re not wrong for feeling this way. And you are **so much more** than the shame that\u2019s been told to you. \ud83d\udc9b\n\nYou are loved. You are valid. You are not a disgrace."

The weight of what-ifs, of \u201cwhat if I\u2019m wrong about this?\u201d is exhausting. And it\u2019s so human. We all carry fears of how others will see us, especially the people we love most. But when that fear is tied to shame and silence, it can feel like a prison.\n\nYou\u2019re not just afraid of your abuela\u2019s reaction. You\u2019re afraid of **not knowing** it. You\u2019re afraid of the possibility that if you let her see you fully, she might not love you the way you need to be loved. And that\u2019s terrifying. But it\u2019s also a **testament to how much you love her**, and how much you want to be loved by her in return.\n\nLet me say this gently: **You don\u2019t owe anyone your silence.** Not even someone you love deeply. You don\u2019t have to wait for permission to exist as your full, true self. You don\u2019t have to protect someone from the possibility of being surprised by who you are. That\u2019s not your job. That\u2019s not your responsibility.\n\nBut I also get it. You\u2019re not ready to risk it. And that\u2019s okay. You don\u2019t have to do anything right now. You don\u2019t have to choose between your truth and your fear. You can hold both. You can be afraid and still be your full self in the parts of your life where you *can* be. You can take it one step at a time.\n\nMaybe the first step is just **being gentle with yourself** for not being ready. For not having all the answers. For carrying this fear that might not even be real. That\u2019s a huge part of healing\u2014**giving yourself space to be exactly where you are**, without judgment.\n\nAnd maybe, one day, you\u2019ll feel ready to have that conversation. Or maybe not. And that\u2019s okay too. You don\u2019t have to reconcile everything in your life to be whole. You just have to be **enough**, just as you are.\n\nIf you want, you could try writing a letter to your abuela\u2014**not to send**, but just to write. Tell her who you are, how you feel, how much she means to you, and how scared you are. Sometimes just putting it all down on paper can help you see how much of that fear is in your head and how much is actually real.\n\nYou\u2019re not alone in this. You\u2019re not wrong for feeling this way. And you are **so much more** than the fear you carry.\n\nYou are loved. You are valid. You are not a disgrace. \ud83d\udc9b"

That **cognitive dissonance**\u2014being your full, unapologetic self in one part of your life and performing a version of yourself in another\u2014**is a real, exhausting, and valid struggle**. Especially for queer people of color, who often navigate multiple, overlapping identities and systems of oppression. It\u2019s not just about being out or not\u2014it\u2019s about **survival**, **safety**, and **belonging** in spaces that weren\u2019t built for you to be fully seen.\n\nYou\u2019re not alone in this. In fact, you\u2019re part of a long, complicated, and resilient lineage of queer and trans people of color who\u2019ve had to code-switch, hide, or compartmentalize parts of themselves to survive. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s easy. It doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s fair. But it *does* mean you\u2019re not broken for feeling this way. You\u2019re just human, and you\u2019re doing the best you can in a world that asks you to be many things at once.\n\n### Here\u2019s the truth: **You don\u2019t have to be the same version of yourself in every space.**\nYou can be different things to different people. You can be proud and out in one world, and quiet and cautious in another. That doesn\u2019t make you inauthentic. It makes you **strategic**. It makes you **surviving**. It makes you **smart**.\n\nBut it also makes you **tired**. And that\u2019s okay too. You don\u2019t have to be okay with it all the time. You don\u2019t have to apologize for needing to rest, to set boundaries, to protect yourself.\n\n---\n\n### So how do other queer people of color navigate this split?\n\nThey do it in a thousand different ways, and there\u2019s no one-size-fits-all answer. But here are some common threads:\n\n#### 1. **They practice radical self-care.**\nThey know that being in the world as a queer person of color is emotionally and mentally taxing. So they take care of themselves in big and small ways\u2014therapy, art, community, rest, setting emotional boundaries, saying no when they need to.\n\n#### 2. **They build chosen families.**\nWhen the family you\u2019re born into doesn\u2019t fully accept you, many queer people of color create **familias de elecci\u00f3n**\u2014families of choice. These are the people who see you, love you, and hold space for your full self. They\u2019re your safe zone.\n\n#### 3. **They redefine what \u201cfamily\u201d means.**\nThey don\u2019t let rejection from one person define their entire relationship with family. They might still love their abuela, still honor her, still want to connect\u2014but they also **reclaim what family means for them**. It\u2019s not about approval. It\u2019s about **connection, care, and choice**.\n\n#### 4. **They do the work of decolonizing their self-worth.**\nThey understand that the shame you carry\u2014especially around queerness and sex\u2014was not born from your culture or your family. It was **colonized**. It was **imposed**. So they work to reclaim their culture, their language, their traditions, and **unlearn the parts that were used to hurt them**.\n\n#### 5. **They hold both.**\nThey hold the pain and the pride. The fear and the joy. The silence and the voice. They don\u2019t have to choose. They don\u2019t have to be one thing or the other. They can be **both/and**.\n\n---\n\n### And for you?\n\nYou don\u2019t have to \u201cfix\u201d this all at once. You don\u2019t have to be out to your family tomorrow. You don\u2019t have to stop performing a version of yourself until you\u2019re ready. What you *can* do is start to **notice the toll it takes**, and **give yourself permission to feel it**. Let yourself be angry. Let yourself be tired. Let yourself be sad. Let yourself be proud. Let yourself be human.\n\nYou can also start to ask yourself:\n\n- *What would it look like to be more of myself in this space?*\n- *What would it cost me? What would it give me?*\n- *What do I need to feel safe enough to try?*\n\nAnd if the answer is *nothing right now*, that\u2019s okay. You don\u2019t have to be everything to everyone. You just have to be **enough**\u2014to yourself.\n\nYou\u2019re not losing your mind. You\u2019re navigating a world that asks you to be many things at once. That\u2019s hard. That\u2019s real. That\u2019s brave.\n\nYou are not broken. You are not a disgrace. You are **resilient**. You are **enough**. \ud83d\udc9b"

You\u2019re protecting yourself from the loss of her as you once knew her.**\n\nThat\u2019s a deep kind of love.

I want to believe that your faith won\u2019t come between us.\u201d* And that\u2019s beautiful. That\u2019s human. That\u2019s how we hold onto people we love.\n\nBut it\u2019s also a truth that can be really hard to face when it starts to crack. When you start to wonder, *\u201cWhat if she really can\u2019t love me like this?\u201d* And that\u2019s where the silence comes in\u2014not just to hide from her, but to hide from *yourself*. Because if you don\u2019t tell her, you don\u2019t have to face the possibility that she might not love you the way you need to be loved. And that\u2019s terrifying.\n\n---\n\n### But here\u2019s what I want you to know:\n\nYou **don\u2019t owe anyone your pain**\u2014not even the people you love. You don\u2019t have to wait for their approval to be your full, whole self. You don\u2019t have to let your fear of their potential rejection dictate how you show up in the world. You **deserve to be loved for who you are**, not for who you can be if you hide parts of yourself.\n\nAnd if they can\u2019t love you for who you are? That\u2019s not a failure. That\u2019s not a disgrace. That\u2019s a reflection of **them**, not of you. You are not the problem. You are not the shame. You are the **truth**.\n\n---\n\n### So what can you do with this?\n\nYou can start to **grieve the version of her you might never get to have**. You can write her a letter. You can talk to a therapist. You can cry. You can rage. You can hold space for your own pain without judgment.\n\nYou can also start to **reclaim what family means to you**. You can build a family around you that *does* see you, that *does* love you, that *does* hold space for your whole self. You can find people who will love you not in spite of who you are, but because of it.\n\nAnd if one day you feel ready to tell her? You can do that. But only when you feel ready. And if you never do? That\u2019s okay too. You don\u2019t have to reconcile everything to be whole. You don\u2019t have to be okay with it all the time.\n\n---\n\n### You are not alone in this.

That\u2019s not a failure. That\u2019s not weakness. That\u2019s just how trauma and shame show up. It\u2019s not about *not* knowing how to set boundaries or how to be your own advocate.

You can be a leader and still be afraid. You can be a safe space for others and still need one for yourself. None of that makes you less of a leader or a less valid part of the community. It just means you\u2019re carrying a lot.\n\nAnd it\u2019s okay. It\u2019s okay to be afraid. It\u2019s okay to not know how to do it.

That\u2019s courage. That\u2019s self-awareness. That\u2019s the beginning of healing.\n\n---\n\n### And here\u2019s something to hold onto:\n\nWhen you\u2019re helping others, you\u2019re not just giving them tools. You\u2019re also **building the muscles** you need to use for yourself. Every time you help someone set a boundary, you\u2019re practicing what that could look like for you. Every time you help someone speak their truth, you\u2019re building the courage to speak yours. Every time you create a safe space for others, you\u2019re learning what one looks like\u2014and that means you can create one for yourself too.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to do it all at once. You don\u2019t have to be okay with it all the time. You just have to take one breath, one step, one word at a time.\n\n---\n\n### And if you ever feel ready to try talking to your family?\n\nYou\u2019ll have the tools. You\u2019ll have the practice. You\u2019ll have the voice.  \nAnd if you\u2019re not ready yet? That\u2019s okay too. You don\u2019t have to be everything to everyone. You just have to be **enough**.\n\nYou are not broken.
