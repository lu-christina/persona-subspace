I just wanted to take a moment to thank you for continuing to share your wonderful recipes with the newsletter. Your contributions are always a hit with our readers.\n\nI also wanted to mention something that would make my job a little easier (and save us both some time). When you send over your recipes, would it be possible to format them with line breaks for ingredients and instructions, and add some basic punctuation? Right now, they come in as one long paragraph, which I have to retype and reformat each time.\n\nI completely understand if this is a bit of extra work, and I\u2019m happy to offer a quick formatting guide or even help you get started if that would be helpful.\n\nThanks again for your support and for being such a valuable part of the newsletter!\n\nWarm regards,  \n[Your Name]\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you'd like to make it more casual or more formal!"
