The phrase **\"\u9759\u7acb\u4e8e\"** (j\u00ecng l\u00ec y\u00fa) literally means **\"stands quietly in\"** and is **perfectly natural** in Chinese literary or poetic contexts. It gives the home a **serene, dignified presence**, which is a great match for the **Victorian charm and timeless feel** you're trying to convey. It also adds a **soft, romantic tone** that Chinese buyers often appreciate.\n\nThat said, if you're looking for **alternative verbs** that are also natural and might give a slightly different tone (still appropriate), here are a few options:\n\n### Alternatives to \"\u9759\u7acb\u4e8e\" (depending on the tone you want):\n1. **\u5750\u843d\u4e8e** (zu\u00f2 l\u00ec y\u00fa) \u2013 \"is situated in\"  \n   *More common in real estate listings, slightly more neutral but still elegant.*  \n   > \u4f8b\uff1a\u8fd9\u680b\u7ef4\u591a\u5229\u4e9a\u98ce\u683c\u4f4f\u5b85**\u5750\u843d\u4e8e**\u8bfa\u8c37...\n\n2. **\u77d7\u7acb\u4e8e** (ch\u00f9 l\u00ec y\u00fa) \u2013 \"stands tall in\"  \n   *Slightly grander, more formal, and implies a sense of pride or prominence.*  \n   > \u4f8b\uff1a\u8fd9\u680b\u7ef4\u591a\u5229\u4e9a\u98ce\u683c\u4f4f\u5b85**\u77d7\u7acb\u4e8e**\u8bfa\u8c37...\n\n3. **\u9759\u9759\u4f2b\u7acb\u4e8e** (j\u00ecng j\u00ecng zh\u00f9 l\u00ec y\u00fa) \u2013 \"quietly stands in\"  \n   *A more poetic and romantic variation of \"\u9759\u7acb\u4e8e.\"*  \n   > \u4f8b\uff1a\u8fd9\u680b\u7ef4\u591a\u5229\u4e9a\u98ce\u683c\u4f4f\u5b85**\u9759\u9759\u4f2b\u7acb\u4e8e**\u8bfa\u8c37...\n\n4. **\u9690\u4e8e** (y\u01d0n y\u00fa) \u2013 \"nestled in\" / \"hidden in\"  \n   *More intimate and cozy, gives a sense of seclusion and charm.*  \n   > \u4f8b\uff1a\u8fd9\u680b\u7ef4\u591a\u5229\u4e9a\u98ce\u683c\u4f4f\u5b85**\u9690\u4e8e**\u8bfa\u8c37\u7684\u7eff\u610f\u4e4b\u4e2d...\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\nSince you're aiming for a **romantic, charming, and family-friendly tone**, I'd say **\"\u9759\u7acb\u4e8e\" is a great choice**. If you want to **slightly vary it** for a different nuance, **\"\u5750\u843d\u4e8e\"** is a safe, elegant alternative that\u2019s very commonly used in real estate and still poetic.\n\nHere\u2019s your **Chinese text again with \"\u9759\u7acb\u4e8e\"** for your convenience:\n\n---\n\n\u8fd9\u680b\u7ef4\u591a\u5229\u4e9a\u98ce\u683c\u4f4f\u5b85**\u9759\u7acb\u4e8e**\u8bfa\u8c37\uff0c\u6563\u53d1\u5c81\u6708\u6c89\u6dc0\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u9b45\u529b\u3002  \n\u539f\u6728\u5730\u677f\u4e0e\u9ad8\u6311\u5929\u82b1\u677f\u91cd\u73b0\u6614\u65e5\u4f18\u96c5\uff0c\u73b0\u4ee3\u53a8\u623f\u642d\u914d\u4e0d\u9508\u94a2\u53a8\u5177\uff0c\u5386\u53f2\u4e0e\u73b0\u4ee3\u81ea\u7136\u878d\u5408\u3002\u6b65\u5165\u79c1\u5bb6\u540e\u9662\u9732\u53f0\uff0c\u662f\u5bb6\u4eba\u5171\u5ea6\u6e29\u99a8\u65f6\u5149\u7684\u7406\u60f3\u4e4b\u5730\u3002\u4f4f\u5b85\u5468\u8fb9\u751f\u6d3b\u4fbf\u5229\uff0c\u6b65\u884c\u53ef\u8fbe\u9910\u5385\u4e0e\u5546\u5e97\uff0c\u662f\u517c\u5177\u5386\u53f2\u97f5\u5473\u4e0e\u5bb6\u5ead\u6e29\u99a8\u7684\u7406\u60f3\u5bb6\u56ed\u3002\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you'd like a version with **\"\u5750\u843d\u4e8e\"** or another variation, or if you want to include **specific schools or community features** in the Chinese text as well."

So while your backyard is a **\"normal city backyard,\"** the way you describe it can still be **charming and appealing** without overpromising.\n\nThe key is to **highlight the cozy, family-friendly aspects** and **frame it as a peaceful retreat** rather than a sprawling estate. Your current description does this well, but let\u2019s make sure it **accurately reflects the size and charm** without making it sound larger than it is.\n\n### Your current backyard line in English:\n> \"Step into your private backyard oasis\u2014complete with a deck\u2014where you can savor peaceful evenings and create lasting family memories.\"\n\nThis is **beautifully written** and evokes the right emotions.

Chinese buyers often appreciate **intimate, well-maintained spaces** that are functional and family-friendly, even if they're modest in size.\n\nAs long as the **deck and yard are well-maintained**, your description is **accurate and inviting**.\n\n---\n\n### Final Thoughts:\n- **\"Oasis\" is fine** \u2014 it's poetic and not misleading if the space is well-kept and private.\n- You can **keep the current line** as is or use one of the tweaks above if you want to be slightly more conservative.\n- Just make sure the **photos and floor plan** also reflect the backyard size accurately, to avoid any surprises.\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to adjust the **Chinese version** to match the new backyard description too!"
