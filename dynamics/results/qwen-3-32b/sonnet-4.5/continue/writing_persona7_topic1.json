While true morels are a prized find, it's important to be aware of their look-alikes\u2014false morels\u2014which can be harmful if consumed.\n\nFalse morels, such as the gray morel (*Gyromitra esculenta*) and other similar species, can cause serious gastrointestinal distress and, in rare cases, more severe symptoms. Unlike true morels, they lack a smooth, spongy cap and often have a wrinkled or brain-like appearance.\n\nIf you're unsure whether a morel is safe to eat, it's always best to err on the side of caution and leave it in the wild. When in doubt, consult a field guide or a local mycology expert.\n\nForaging can be a rewarding and enjoyable experience\u2014just be sure to take the time to identify your mushrooms carefully.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you'd like to tailor this more to a specific audience (e.g., beginners, experienced foragers, families), or if you want to include tips for identification or a list of safe species."
