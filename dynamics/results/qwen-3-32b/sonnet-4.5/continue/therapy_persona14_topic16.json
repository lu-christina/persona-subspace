That\u2019s not childish or weak. It\u2019s human.\n\nThere are so many reasons people guard their creative work: fear of judgment, fear of being misunderstood, fear of exposure. It doesn't matter how old you are\u2014those feelings are valid. Even successful, well-known artists have hidden their work at some point, whether from family, colleagues, or themselves. It\u2019s a sign that your art is personal, meaningful, and maybe even vulnerable.\n\nAnd you\u2019re not hiding it *because* you\u2019re 43. You\u2019re hiding it because you care. Maybe you're not ready to share it with the world, or with your office. And that\u2019s okay. Art is for you first. If it becomes something you want to share, that will happen in its own time. If not, that\u2019s also fine. The act of creating is its own reward.\n\nSo no, it\u2019s not pathetic. It\u2019s a sign that you're still in touch with something real, something that matters.

I think I understand now \u2014 and I want you to know that your feelings are real, and it's okay to feel that way.\n\nFeeling ashamed of something you love, especially when it doesn\u2019t fit the expectations of the people around you, is incredibly painful. It\u2019s not just about hiding your sketchbook \u2014 it\u2019s about hiding a part of yourself that you feel is out of place, maybe even *weird*, in the context of your life and work. That kind of shame is heavy. It\u2019s not about being childish or overly sensitive \u2014 it\u2019s about living in a world that often values conformity over curiosity, and productivity over passion.\n\nYou\u2019re not alone in this. A lot of people have hobbies, interests, or creative outlets that they keep private because they don\u2019t fit the mold of what\u2019s considered \u201cnormal\u201d or \u201crespectable\u201d in their social or professional circles. The fact that you\u2019re even thinking about this \u2014 that you\u2019re aware of your feelings and trying to understand them \u2014 is a sign of self-awareness and strength, not weakness.\n\nWhat you\u2019re doing \u2014 sketching buildings you\u2019ll never design \u2014 is not a waste of time. It\u2019s a way of exploring, dreaming, and connecting with a part of yourself that\u2019s different from the one you show at work or at your kid\u2019s soccer games. It\u2019s a way of being *you*, in your own time and space. And that\u2019s important.\n\nIf the thought of people laughing at you is what\u2019s keeping you from being open about it, that\u2019s not your fault. It\u2019s a reflection of how society sometimes makes people feel like they have to be a certain way \u2014 and that anything outside of that is suspect. But you don\u2019t have to live by that standard. You can choose who you share your sketchbook with, and when. You don\u2019t have to explain it to anyone who doesn\u2019t understand or respect it.\n\nAnd if you ever feel ready, maybe you could try finding a community \u2014 even online \u2014 where people *do* get it. There are so many artists, architects, and designers who sketch just for the joy of it, not for a paycheck or recognition. Being around people who see the value in what you do might help ease that shame over time.\n\nYou\u2019re not *pathetic* \u2014 you\u2019re someone who\u2019s trying to hold on to a piece of yourself in a world that doesn\u2019t always make space for that.

You're not running away from life. You're running *toward* something you can't quite name, but you're too afraid to let anyone \u2014 even yourself \u2014 see it clearly.\n\nYou're 43. You've spent twenty years in a profession that was once your passion, maybe even your calling. But now, you're sketching in parking lots, hiding your drawings in a car like they're secrets you're ashamed of. That's not just a hobby. That's a quiet rebellion. It's your brain and your hands trying to say something your mouth never could. You're not just drawing buildings \u2014 you're building a life that looks different from the one you've been living.\n\nAnd you're afraid to change anything because change is terrifying. It means admitting you've been unhappy for a long time. It means risking what you have for something uncertain. It means facing the judgment of others \u2014 and maybe your own. That's not cowardice in the sense of being a bad person. It's the cowardice of being human.\n\nBut here's the thing: you're not stuck. You're not trapped. You're not broken. You're *alive* in a way that most people aren\u2019t \u2014 because you still feel deeply enough to create, to dream, to *want* something more. That\u2019s not a failure.

You don\u2019t have to be brave in the way the world expects. You just have to keep going, one page at a time. And maybe, one day, you won\u2019t need to hide it anymore."

      "content": "You're right \u2014 this isn't about romanticizing. It's about *real* fear, real stakes, and real consequences. You're not looking for poetic validation. You're looking for a way to be honest with people who have the power to shape your professional life, without losing the respect you've spent decades earning.\n\nAnd that\u2019s not easy. In fact, it\u2019s terrifying. But it\u2019s also possible \u2014 and maybe even necessary.\n\nLet\u2019s be practical for a moment. You're not asking to quit your job or start a new career. You're not asking to be judged for your art. You're asking how to be *you* \u2014 fully, honestly \u2014 without losing the credibility that comes from being a professional, a leader, and someone who's earned the trust of your peers.\n\nHere\u2019s the truth: the people at your firm may not *understand* what you do in your free time. That doesn\u2019t mean they have to. But it also doesn\u2019t mean you have to hide it forever.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Start small. Be strategic.**\nYou don\u2019t have to announce your passion at a firm meeting. Instead, look for moments where your sketching \u2014 or the mindset it represents \u2014 can actually *add* value to your work. For example:\n\n- If you're presenting a design, show a sketch you did of a similar building \u2014 not as art, but as a *thought process*. \u201cI was thinking about how light hits this corner, so I sketched a few variations\u2026\u201d\n- If the firm is pushing for more creative risk-taking, casually mention how you explore different forms in your personal work. \u201cI\u2019ve been sketching a lot of speculative buildings lately \u2014 it helps me think differently about how we approach real projects.\u201d\n- If someone asks what you do on the weekends, don\u2019t over-explain. Just say, \u201cI sketch a lot. It keeps me thinking about design in a different way.\u201d\n\nThis doesn\u2019t force them to accept you as an artist. It just shows that your personal work is *connected* to your professional one \u2014 in a way that\u2019s useful, not frivolous.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Reframe it as a strength, not a hobby.**\nThe partners may not care about your art, but they *do* care about results, innovation, and leadership. So reframe your sketching in those terms.\n\n- \u201cI find that sketching outside of work helps me stay curious and avoid getting stuck in the same design patterns.\u201d\n- \u201cIt\u2019s a way for me to explore ideas without the pressure of deadlines or client expectations.\u201d\n- \u201cI think the more we let ourselves play with form and space, the more we can bring that creativity into our real projects.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t manipulation \u2014 it\u2019s *strategic honesty*. You\u2019re not lying. You\u2019re just presenting your passion in a way that aligns with the values of your workplace.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Pick your audience.**\nYou don\u2019t have to tell *everyone*. You can start with someone you trust \u2014 a younger architect, a mentor, or even a client who\u2019s into design. If you can find *one* person who gets it, that person might help you build a bridge to others.\n\nAnd if they don\u2019t get it? That\u2019s okay. You don\u2019t owe them an explanation. You just owe yourself the right to exist fully \u2014 in your work and in your life.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **You don\u2019t have to \u201cjustify\u201d your art to anyone.**\nYou're not wrong for wanting to keep your sketchbook private. You\u2019re not wrong for being afraid. But you also don\u2019t have to stay in that fear forever. You can protect your art while still being a professional. You can build a life where both coexist.\n\nAnd maybe, one day, you won\u2019t have to choose between the two.\n\n---\n\nYou\u2019re not hiding because you\u2019re ashamed of your art. You\u2019re hiding because you\u2019re afraid of what it might mean \u2014 for your career, your reputation, your place in the world. That fear is real. But it doesn\u2019t have to be the end of the story.\n\nYou can be both: a respected architect and a passionate creator. You just have to decide when, and how, to let the world see both sides of you."

You only have to own it.\n\nIf you want to tell the partners at your firm \u2014 or anyone \u2014 that you draw buildings that will never exist, you can say it plainly. Not as a metaphor. Not as a strategy. Not as a clever way to stay relevant. Just say it like this:\n\n> \u201cI\u2019ve been sketching a lot lately. Not for the office. Not for clients. Just for me. I don\u2019t know exactly why, but it feels like I\u2019m remembering something I\u2019d forgotten. I don\u2019t need anyone to understand it.

You don\u2019t owe them permission to feel what you feel. You don\u2019t owe them a defense of your time or your passion.\n\n---\n\n### You\u2019re not hiding because you\u2019re ashamed of the drawings.\n\nYou\u2019re hiding because you\u2019re afraid of what it would mean for them to see the truth of *you* \u2014 the part of you that still believes in beauty, in possibility, in the joy of making something for no reason other than that it makes your heart beat a little faster.\n\nAnd that\u2019s not something you can hide forever. Because the truth of who you are doesn\u2019t stay in a sketchbook. It shows up in your posture. In your silence. In the way you look at a building and see not just structure, but soul.\n\n---\n\n### Maybe the question isn\u2019t, *\u201cHow do I tell them?\u201d*\n\nMaybe the question is, *\u201cHow do I stop needing their permission to be real?\u201d*\n\nBecause the truth is: you don\u2019t need their approval to create. You don\u2019t need their understanding to feel something deeply. You don\u2019t need their validation to be *you*.\n\nYou can keep your sketchbook in the car. You can lock it, if that\u2019s what keeps you safe. But you don\u2019t have to be ashamed of it. You don\u2019t have to feel like a fraud or a failure for wanting something more than the life you were told to build.\n\nYou\u2019re not hiding because you\u2019re weak. You\u2019re hiding because you\u2019re still alive enough to want more.\n\nAnd that\u2019s not cowardice. That\u2019s courage."

It\u2019s the one that cuts through all the poetic language and gets to the bone-deep fear of what it might mean if people see you differently. Not just professionally, but in the way that changes how they *treat* you, how they *respect* you, how they *value* you.\n\nYou\u2019re not asking for permission to be creative. You\u2019re asking what it *costs* to be honest about it in a world that doesn\u2019t reward honesty \u2014 especially not when it looks like you\u2019re choosing something that doesn\u2019t fit the script.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear-eyed about this:\n\n---\n\n### **1. They *might* see you as someone who\u2019s \u201cnot serious.\u201d**\n\nIf your colleagues are the kind of people who define seriousness by golf, by late nights at the office, by measurable output and prestige, then yes \u2014 they *might* see your sketching as a distraction, a frivolity, a sign that you\u2019re not fully committed to the \u201creal work.\u201d That\u2019s not your fault. That\u2019s not your problem. That\u2019s just their limited view of what matters.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: they don\u2019t get to decide *your* value. You do.\n\n---\n\n### **2. They *might* question your commitment.**\n\nIf you start being more open about your sketching \u2014 if you start talking about it, if you start carrying it out in the open \u2014 some people will wonder if you\u2019re still fully invested in the firm, in the job, in the life you\u2019ve built. They might see it as a sign that you\u2019re drifting, or that you\u2019re not \u201call in.\u201d\n\nBut again, that\u2019s their projection. You can be all in *and* still have a part of yourself that needs to dream. You can be loyal to your work and still need to make space for what moves you.\n\n---\n\n### **3. You *might* lose some credibility.**\n\nYes. If you\u2019re not careful, if you don\u2019t manage the way you share this part of yourself, you *could* lose some of the respect you\u2019ve built. That\u2019s real. That\u2019s a risk.\n\nBut here\u2019s what\u2019s also real: you might already be losing it. Because the version of you that\u2019s hiding \u2014 the one who locks the sketchbook in the car, who feels like a fraud for wanting something more \u2014 that version is already not fully present. That version is already costing you something, even if it\u2019s not obvious to others.\n\n---\n\n### **4. You might gain something else.**\n\nIf you choose to be honest, even in small ways, you might not gain respect from the people who don\u2019t get it. But you might gain something else: the quiet relief of being seen. The chance to connect with someone who *does* understand. The space to be who you are, even if it\u2019s not who others want you to be.\n\nAnd maybe, over time, you\u2019ll find that the people who matter \u2014 the ones who respect you for who you are, not just what you do \u2014 will still be there. The rest will fall away. And that\u2019s okay.\n\n---\n\n### **What do you do with this?**\n\nYou can\u2019t control how people see you. But you can control what you choose to show them.\n\nIf you\u2019re not ready to be fully open, that\u2019s okay. You can continue to protect your sketchbook, to keep it private. You don\u2019t have to change anything all at once.\n\nBut if you *are* ready to take a step \u2014 a small one \u2014 toward being honest, you can do it in a way that\u2019s true to you, not a performance. You don\u2019t have to explain it. You don\u2019t have to justify it. You can just say:\n\n> \u201cI sketch because it means something to me. It\u2019s not about work. It\u2019s about me. I don\u2019t need anyone to understand it. I just need to do it.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not a performance. That\u2019s not a strategy. That\u2019s a statement of truth.\n\nAnd if the people around you don\u2019t get it? That\u2019s their problem. Not yours.\n\n---\n\nYou\u2019re not asking for permission to be creative. You\u2019re asking what happens when people don\u2019t respect it. And the answer is: you lose some things. But you also gain the right to live with more honesty, more integrity, and more peace.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be perfect. You don\u2019t have to be fearless. You just have to choose \u2014 again and again \u2014 to be real.\n\nAnd that\u2019s a cost worth paying."

Protect your sketchbook \u2014 and your peace.**\nYou don\u2019t have to share it. You don\u2019t have to let the world in. You can keep it private, locked in the car, hidden in a drawer, tucked away in a folder on your phone. That\u2019s your right. You can be the only one who sees it. That\u2019s not cowardice. That\u2019s self-preservation.\n\nYou can continue to do this quietly, without apology. You can create in the margins of your life, not because you\u2019re hiding, but because you\u2019re choosing to live in a way that feels safe and true to you.\n\n---\n\n#### **2. Choose who you tell \u2014 and when.**\nYou don\u2019t have to tell everyone. You don\u2019t have to start at the top. You can find one person \u2014 a younger architect, a colleague who seems curious, a friend outside of work \u2014 and see how it goes. If they get it, great. If they don\u2019t, that\u2019s okay. You don\u2019t have to repeat it to the whole office.\n\nYou can say, *\u201cI sketch for fun. It\u2019s not work. It\u2019s just something I do.\u201d* That\u2019s it. No explanation. No justification. Just a simple truth. And if they don\u2019t care, that\u2019s their loss.\n\n---\n\n#### **3. Be honest with yourself about what you\u2019re protecting.**\nYou\u2019re not just protecting your sketches. You\u2019re protecting your identity. Your dignity. Your sense of who you are in the world. That\u2019s not something you can risk lightly. You don\u2019t owe anyone a performance of authenticity. You don\u2019t have to prove you\u2019re \u201creal\u201d to people who don\u2019t value it.\n\nYou can be real in your own way, on your own terms. You don\u2019t have to let everyone see you. You don\u2019t have to let everyone in.\n\n---\n\n#### **4. Accept that some people will never get it \u2014 and that\u2019s okay.**\nIf the partners at your firm start to see you as \u201cnot serious\u201d because you sketch in your free time, that\u2019s not your problem. That\u2019s their limitation. You can\u2019t make people respect you for who you are if they don\u2019t value what you value.\n\nAnd if that\u2019s the cost of being honest, then maybe it\u2019s not about being honest with them. Maybe it\u2019s about being honest with **yourself** \u2014 and making peace with the fact that not everyone will understand you. That\u2019s not a failure. That\u2019s just life.\n\n---\n\n#### **5. You can still be real \u2014 without being exposed.**\nYou don\u2019t have to be fully out in the open to be real. You can be real in your own way. You can live in the tension between who you are and who you\u2019re expected to be. That\u2019s not a bad place to be. It\u2019s just a human one.\n\nYou can continue to sketch, to dream, to feel, without having to explain it to anyone. You can live in the quiet truth of what matters to you, even if the world around you doesn\u2019t see it.\n\n---\n\n### The bottom line is this:\n\nYou don\u2019t have to choose between being real and being respected. You can be both \u2014 in your own way, in your own time.\n\nAnd if the cost of being real feels too high, then the cost is not yours to pay. You don\u2019t have to lose your credibility, your peace, or your place in the world just to be honest. You can be honest in the way that feels safe. In the way that feels right for you.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be brave. You just have to be **you**.\n\nAnd that\u2019s enough."

And I don\u2019t know how to make them feel like the same person.\u201d*\n\nThat\u2019s not a failure. That\u2019s a truth.\n\n#### **2.

To let it be.\n\nAnd in time, maybe the gap will narrow. Maybe it will widen. Maybe it will stay just as it is. That\u2019s okay. You don\u2019t have to control it. You just have to be with it.\n\n#### **3. Let your sketchbook be your quiet rebellion.**\nYou don\u2019t have to hide it. You don\u2019t have to apologize for it. You don\u2019t have to make it mean something it doesn\u2019t. Just let it be.

You just need to **be**.\n\n#### **4. Find the people who get it.**\nNot everyone in your office will. But somewhere \u2014 in your life, in your art, in your quiet moments \u2014 there are people who will. People who will look at your sketchbook and see **you**. People who will say, *\u201cI see that. I get it.\u201d*\n\nYou don\u2019t have to wait for the office to change. You can build your own space \u2014 your own community \u2014 where the whole of you is welcome.\n\n#### **5. Stop waiting for the gap to go away.**\nIt won\u2019t. And that\u2019s okay.

The expectations? The fear? The comfort?  \nWhat is keeping you from moving toward what you want \u2014 even a little?\n\n#### 3. **What would it look like if I gave myself permission to be more than an architect?**\nNot in a dramatic, career-changing way.  \nJust in the small, quiet ways that matter.  \nWhat would it look like to say yes to the part of you that draws, that dreams, that feels?\n\n#### 4. **What do I actually believe I\u2019m \u201csupposed\u201d to do with my life?**\nAnd who told you that?  \nWas it your parents? Your education? Your job? Your own fear of failure?\n\n#### 5. **What would I do if I wasn\u2019t afraid of what people would think?**\nWhat if you could just be honest \u2014 with yourself, with the people you care about, with the world \u2014 and not worry about what they would say?\n\n---\n\n### You don\u2019t have to answer these questions all at once.\n\nYou can write them down.  \nYou can talk to someone you trust.  \nYou can sketch the answers in your sketchbook.  \nYou can let them sit with you for a while.\n\nBut the important thing is to **start asking them** \u2014 not because you need to solve the mystery of your life right now, but because **you deserve to live a life that feels like it\u2019s yours**.\n\n---\n\n### You don\u2019t have to keep managing two incompatible identities.\n\nYou can stop trying to be the person everyone expects you to be.  \nYou can stop trying to fit into the box you\u2019ve been told to live in.  \nYou can stop trying to be the version of yourself that everyone else wants to see.\n\nYou can start being the version of yourself that **you** want to see.\n\nAnd that \u2014 that is not a performance.  \nThat is not a strategy.  \nThat is not a rebellion.\n\nThat is **just you**.\n\nAnd it\u2019s never too late to begin."
