      "content": "Great question \u2014 the **title of your story highlight** is your first chance to hook people, so it should be **clear enough to be helpful** but **fun enough to feel approachable**.\n\nHere\u2019s a quick breakdown of your options:\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Best Option: \"How to Say It\"**  \n- **Feels more inviting** than \u201cPronunciation\u201d (which sounds a little dry or formal).  \n- **Sounds like a tip**, not a lesson.  \n- **Perfectly clear** \u2014 people know what they\u2019ll get.  \n- **Works well for brand voice** that\u2019s friendly and not too corporate.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udfe1 **Also Good: \"Pronunciation\"**  \n- **Straightforward** and **searchable**.  \n- If your brand is more **design-forward or minimalist**, this might feel more in line with your tone.  \n- But it can feel a little **too on-the-nose** or **techy** for a casual audience.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udfe2 **Emoji-Only Option (e.g., \ud83c\udf3f or \ud83c\udde9\ud83c\uddf0)**  \n- **Cute and vibe-y**, but **not very discoverable** \u2014 people might not know what it means unless they\u2019re already curious.  \n- Best used as a **secondary highlight** or in combination with text.  \n- Great for a **visual brand**, but not the best for clarity.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf **Recommendation: \"How to Say It\"**  \nIt\u2019s the sweet spot between **clear**, **approachable**, and **slightly playful**. It invites people in without making them feel like they're being corrected.\n\n---\n\n### Bonus: If you want to be a little cheeky and still keep it fun:\n- **\u201cGron & Tr\u00e5d 101\u201d**  \n- **\u201cName Check\u201d**  \n- **\u201cSpelling Bee\u201d**  \n- **\u201cPronunciation Please\u201d**\n\nBut stick with **\u201cHow to Say It\u201d** if you want something clean and simple that works across platforms and audiences.\n\nLet me know if you want help writing the visual text or caption that goes with the highlight!"

We know the spelling can be a bit tricky, and we\u2019re cool with it \u2014 even *Danes* mess it up sometimes!  \n>  \n> No worries at all \u2014 just thought I\u2019d share the \u201cofficial\u201d version in case it helps.  \n>  \n> Thanks for your interest in Gr\u00f8n & Tr\u00e5d \u2014 we really appreciate it.  \n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udccb **Shorter Version (for emails or quick replies):**\n\n> Hi [Name],  \n>  \n> Quick note \u2014 we\u2019re **Gron & Tr\u00e5d** (Gron like *green*, Tr\u00e5d like *thread*).
