Let\u2019s rework your draft kicker to be sharp, insightful, and memorable \u2014 while still drawing the parallel between the dot-com bust and today\u2019s AI hype.\n\nHere\u2019s a more grounded and impactful version you can adapt:\n\n---\n\n**Original idea (for context):**  \n*\u201cWe\u2019ve been here before. The dot-com bubble taught us that not every flashy startup is a winner \u2014 and the same could be true for AI. History doesn\u2019t repeat itself, but it rhymes.\u201d*\n\n---\n\n**Rewritten, punchier version:**\n\n> \u201cWe\u2019ve seen this movie before. The dot-com boom was all about potential, and most of it didn\u2019t pan out. Now, we\u2019re watching the same script play out with AI \u2014 just with more algorithms and less shirts. The lesson isn\u2019t that we should dismiss the future, but that we should stop confusing hype for progress.\u201d\n\n---\n\n**Another angle, more cautionary:**\n\n> \u201cThe dot-com bubble taught us that every revolution needs real value, not just buzz. AI is no different. Just because it\u2019s new doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s built to last. The future is exciting \u2014 but not every tech darling deserves a seat at the table.\u201d\n\n---\n\n**Want something even more punchy and dark?**\n\n> \u201cAI is the new dot-com \u2014 except this time, the \u2018.com\u2019 is just a model. And like then, most of it will fail. The difference? We might not even notice until the servers cool down.\u201d\n\n---\n\nLet me know your tone (more serious, more snarky, more hopeful) and I can tailor it even further. But the key is to avoid clich\u00e9s and give the reader something they can actually *feel* \u2014 not just nod at."

The dot-com boom was a fever dream of potential \u2014 and it ended with broken servers and empty offices. Now we\u2019re watching the same script play out with AI, just with more data and fewer people. The difference?

This one might not.

In 2024, we're still building in the same spot, pretending the tide already went out \u2014 and that we\u2019re not still in the surf.\"**\n\nThis keeps the **tide** metaphor alive and **adds a haunting final image** \u2014 we're still in the water, still vulnerable, still not safe.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **4.

To make sure it **lands cleanly**, the paragraph before it should do **just enough** to set up the metaphor without **over-explaining** it or **repeating** it.\n\nYou want the reader to **arrive at the kicker with a sense of inevitability**, not confusion. So the paragraph before should:\n\n1. **Establish the pattern** \u2014 that this isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve seen this kind of hype.\n2. **Hint at the danger** \u2014 without spelling it out.\n3. **Set the stage for the metaphor** \u2014 maybe by referencing the dot-com era and how we\u2019ve seen this before, but not in a way that feels like a lecture.\n\n---\n\n### Here\u2019s a sample paragraph to lead into your kicker:\n\n> \u201cWe like to think we\u2019ve learned from the past \u2014 that we\u2019re wiser now, more sophisticated, less prone to the same mistakes. But the same patterns keep showing up in different costumes. The same promises, the same valuations, the same belief that this time, it\u2019s different. And the same refusal to ask when the next wave of reality is going to crash in.\u201d\n\n---\n\n### Or, if you want something **tighter and more journalistic**:\n\n> \u201cHistory doesn\u2019t repeat itself, but it does leave behind familiar footprints. The dot-com boom was supposed to be a one-time lesson in overpromise and underdelivery. But now, with AI, we\u2019re walking the same path \u2014 just with better headlines and deeper pockets.\u201d\n\n---\n\n### Or, if you want to **keep it lean and punchy**:\n\n> \u201cWe tell ourselves we\u2019re smarter now. That we\u2019ve learned from the dot-com crash. But the same fever is back \u2014 just with neural networks instead of server farms. And the same people are still betting the house.\u201d\n\n---\n\n### The key is to:\n- **Set up the comparison** (dot-com / AI)\n- **Hint at the illusion of progress**\n- **End on a note that makes the kicker feel like a punchline or a punch**\n\n---\n\nLet me know the **voice** of your piece \u2014 is it more **analytical**, **op-ed**, **reporting**, or **satirical**? I can tailor the setup paragraph to match. But the core idea is: **don\u2019t over-explain the metaphor before it** \u2014 just **prime the reader for it**."

This is the **crucial choice** that will determine how your kicker lands.\n\nYou want to **prime the reader** for the final line, but you also want to **avoid stepping on it** \u2014 so the **last sentence before the kicker** should be **just enough context**, not full explanation.\n\nLet\u2019s break it down:\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d **Three lenses to end on before your kicker:**\n\n#### 1. **Investor behavior**  \n*Pros:* Grounds the idea in **action**, not just mindset.  \n*Cons:* Feels **transactional** \u2014 might make the kicker feel like an afterthought.  \n*Best if you want to show the **mechanics** of the cycle.*\n\nExample:  \n> *\u201cVCs are writing the same checks they did in 2000 \u2014 just with new names and bigger models.\u201d*  \n\u2192 Then the kicker lands as a **visual metaphor** for what that behavior looks like.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. **Founder mentality**  \n*Pros:* Humanizes the story.  \n*Cons:* Can feel **personal** or **anecdotal**, not universal.  \n*Best if you want to show the **confidence** or **blindness** of the people building.**\n\nExample:  \n> *\u201cFounders are building for the next era, convinced the old rules no longer apply.\u201d*  \n\u2192 Then the kicker lands as a **quiet contradiction** \u2014 they think they\u2019re safe, but they\u2019re not.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. **Cultural amnesia**  \n*Pros:* Best for **broad, inevitable-feeling conclusions**.  \n*Cons:* Can feel **abstract** or **sweeping** if not handled carefully.  \n*Best if you want to show the **pattern**, not just the players.**\n\nExample:  \n> *\u201cWe\u2019ve moved on from the dot-com crash \u2014 and we\u2019ve moved on from learning from it.\u201d*  \n\u2192 Then the kicker lands as the **inevitable consequence** of that forgetting.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Which is best for your kicker?**\n\n**Cultural amnesia** is the **strongest fit** for your kicker.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause your kicker is **not** about one founder or one investor \u2014 it\u2019s about **a pattern we\u2019re all participating in**, a **shared illusion**. The line \u201cOn wet sand\u201d works best if the reader feels like **we\u2019re all in this**, not just the players.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf So the last idea should be:\n\n> **\u201cWe\u2019ve moved on from the dot-com crash \u2014 and we\u2019ve moved on from learning from it.\u201d**\n\nOr:\n\n> **\u201cWe\u2019ve forgotten the lesson, not the event.\u201d**\n\nOr:\n\n> **\u201cThe dot-com crash is now a cautionary tale \u2014 not a warning.\u201d**\n\n---\n\nAny of these **prime the reader** to expect a **visual, inevitable conclusion** \u2014 and your kicker lands as the **quiet, devastating image** that follows.\n\n---\n\n### Final flow example:\n\n> \u201cThe dot-com crash is now a cautionary tale \u2014 not a warning. In 2000, the dot-com bubble burst. In 2024, we're still building in the same spot, pretending the tide already went out. On wet sand.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a **tight, natural, and powerful flow**.\n\nLet me know if you want to **tighten the setup line** even more \u2014 but this is a **strong, clean way to lead into your kicker**."

On wet sand\"**\n\n- **Feels more open.** Like the reader is **left in the image**, still **processing** it.\n- **More poetic, more ambiguous.** It feels like the metaphor is **still unfolding**, or that the reader is **meant to linger** in it.\n- **Best if you want to leave a sense of **unease** or **uncertainty** \u2014 that the danger is still coming, and we haven\u2019t realized it yet.\n\n---\n\n### So which is better?\n\nIf your **tone is more journalistic or analytical**, **go with the period** \u2014 it feels **cleaner** and **more decisive**.\n\nIf your **tone is more reflective or literary**, the **lack of a period** gives the line a **haunting, unresolved feel**.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendation:\n\n> **\"In 2000, the dot-com bubble burst. In 2024, we're still building in the same spot, pretending the tide already went out. On wet sand.\"**\n\nThis version **lands with the most authority**, and it **feels like the end of a sentence**, not a thought. It gives the line a **quiet, devastating finality** that matches the **inevitability of the metaphor**.\n\nBut if you're going for something **more evocative and open-ended**, the **trailing-off version** works too.\n\nYou're in a great spot either way \u2014 it\u2019s just a matter of **how you want the reader to feel** when they hit the last word."
