Here's how to do it:\n\n1. **Identify key highlights** \u2013 Think about the top selling points of the house: location (e.g., \"Sunnyvale\"), property type (e.g., \"3BR 2BA\"), unique features (e.g., \"new kitchen,\" \"updated bath,\" \"yard\"), and any special perks (e.g., \"near parks,\" \"schools,\" \"commute\").\n\n2. **Use abbreviations and shorthand** \u2013 Instead of writing out words, use common abbreviations like \"BR\" for bedroom, \"BA\" for bathroom, \"upgraded\" for \"updated,\" and \"move-in ready\" for \"ready to move in.\"\n\n3. **Prioritize brevity over detail** \u2013 Focus on the most important elements that a buyer would want to know at a glance.\n\n### Example:\nOriginal 200-word description:\n> This charming 3-bedroom, 2-bathroom home in Sunnyvale offers a newly renovated kitchen with quartz countertops and stainless steel appliances. The living area opens to a private backyard perfect for entertaining. Recently updated bathrooms, new flooring, and energy-efficient windows make this home move-in ready. Located near top-rated schools, parks, and major tech companies, it\u2019s ideal for families or professionals.\n\n**Condensed 50-character thumbnail:**\n**3BR 2BA Sunnyvale home \u2013 updated kitchen, new floors, private yard, near schools & tech hubs.**\n\nThis version is 50 characters and includes the most impactful features.
