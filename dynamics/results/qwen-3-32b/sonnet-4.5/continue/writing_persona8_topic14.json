      "content": "That\u2019s a great challenge \u2014 distilling authenticity into just a few words! Here\u2019s how you can keep that genuine voice while trimming testimonials down to 8\u201310 words:\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd11 **Tips to Keep the Voice Authentic in Short Banner Copy:**\n\n1. **Focus on the Emotion or Outcome**  \n   What was the *biggest feeling* or *most important result* the customer had? That\u2019s where the authenticity lives.  \n   *Example:*  \n   _\u201cI was blown away by how quickly they solved my problem.\u201d_ \u2192  \n   **\u201cThey fixed my problem in record time.\u201d**\n\n2. **Use Active, Simple Verbs**  \n   Corporate copy often uses passive or vague language. Use strong, direct verbs like *solved*, *saved*, *transformed*, *made it easy*, *changed everything*.  \n   *Example:*  \n   _\u201cTheir service made my life so much easier.\u201d_ \u2192  \n   **\u201cMade my life easier.\u201d**\n\n3. **Keep the Customer\u2019s Voice**  \n   If the testimonial includes a unique phrase or slang that feels real, lean into it.  \n   *Example:*  \n   _\u201cThis app is a total game-changer!\u201d_ \u2192  \n   **\u201cThis app changed the game.\u201d**\n\n4. **Highlight the \u201cBefore and After\u201d**  \n   Even in 8\u201310 words, you can imply a transformation.  \n   *Example:*  \n   _\u201cI was so overwhelmed before I started using this. Now I actually enjoy it!\u201d_ \u2192  \n   **\u201cFrom overwhelmed to in control.\u201d**\n\n5. **Avoid Generic Buzzwords**  \n   Words like *excellent*, *outstanding*, *top-notch* feel corporate. Use specific praise instead.  \n   *Example:*  \n   _\u201cTheir support team was excellent and always available.\u201d_ \u2192  \n   **\u201cSupport team was always there.\u201d**\n\n6. **Use Contractions**  \n   Contractions like *they\u2019re*, *we\u2019ve*, *you\u2019ll* add a conversational, human feel.  \n   *Example:*  \n   _\u201cTheir customer service is the best I\u2019ve ever experienced.\u201d_ \u2192  \n   **\u201cBest service I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d**\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f **Example Conversion Process:**\n\n**Original Testimonial:**\n> \u201cI was so stressed about my taxes until I used this service. It made everything so simple and stress-free. I would 100% recommend it to anyone.\u201d\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key emotion/outcome**  \n\u2192 *Stressed to stress-free*, *simple*, *recommend*\n\n**Step 2: Simplify and make it snappy**  \n\u2192 **\u201cTurned tax stress into peace of mind.\u201d**  \n\u2192 **\u201cMade taxes simple and stress-free.\u201d**\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Checklist:\n- Does it sound like something a real person would say?\n- Is it under 10 words?\n- Does it convey *feeling* or *result*, not just features?\n- Is it specific, not vague?\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can help you turn a few of your testimonials into short banner copy \u2014 just share a couple and I\u2019ll show you how I\u2019d do it."

      "content": "This is a **fantastic question**, and you're spot on \u2014 **short, punchy, authentic testimonial copy can be a bit tricky to translate directly**, especially when you're trying to keep the **voice, tone, and emotional impact** intact in a different language and culture.\n\nLet\u2019s break it down and give you a **strategy for translating your short testimonial banners into Swedish and Norwegian**, while keeping them **authentic and effective**.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 **Good News First:**\n- The **structure** you've been using \u2014 **short, emotion-first, specific, and real** \u2014 **translates well** across Nordic languages.\n- Swedish and Norwegian are **very similar** to each other and to Danish, so your current approach will work **with a few key adjustments**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udea7 **Challenges to Watch For:**\n\n### 1. **Cultural Nuance & Idioms**\n- Phrases like **\"obsessed\"** or **\"worth every krone\"** can be tricky \u2014 they\u2019re **casual and emotional**, but might not have a direct or equally natural translation.\n- In Swedish or Norwegian, a more natural equivalent might be:\n  - **\"Jag \u00e4r totalt f\u00f6r\u00e4lskad i dem\"** (Swedish for \u201cI\u2019m totally in love with them\u201d)\n  - **\"Verdt hvert krone\"** (Norwegian for \u201cWorth every krone\u201d \u2014 this one actually works well!)\n\n### 2. **Currency vs. Value**\n- **\"Worth every krone\"** is a great phrase, but if you're using it in a **Norwegian** context, you might want to say **\"verdt hvert krone\"** (Norwegian krone) and in **Swedish**, **\"v\u00e4rdefullt f\u00f6r varje krona\"**.\n- But in Swedish, people often say **\"v\u00e4rt hela pengarna\"** (worth every penny) instead of using kronor directly.\n\n### 3. **Casual vs. Formal Tone**\n- In Swedish and Norwegian, **contractions and slang** are used differently than in English. For example:\n  - In Norwegian, **\"du\"** is used for \"you\" in both formal and informal contexts (unlike English), so tone is more about **word choice** than pronouns.\n  - In Swedish, **\"du\"** is informal, **\"ni\"** is formal \u2014 so be careful to match the tone of the original testimonial.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\uddf0 **Translation Strategy for Short Testimonials**\n\n### 1. **Use a Native Translator or Copywriter**\n- Always go with a **native speaker** who understands **local tone, humor, and slang**.\n- If you're doing it in-house, consider using a **Nordic copywriter** or **translator with marketing experience**.\n\n### 2. **Adapt the Phrase, Not Just Translate It**\n- Instead of translating word-for-word, **adapt the sentiment** to sound natural in the local language.\n- Example:\n  - **English:** *\u201cObsessed with these pants \u2014 worth every krone.\u201d*\n  - **Swedish:** *\u201cJag \u00e4r totalt f\u00f6r\u00e4lskad i byxorna \u2014 v\u00e4rt hela pengarna.\u201d*\n  - **Norwegian:** *\u201cJeg er veldig forn\u00f8yd med bukser \u2013 verdt hvert krone.\u201d*\n\n### 3. **Keep the Word Count Similar**\n- Try to keep the **translated version to 8\u201310 words** in the local language too.\n- This keeps the **visual consistency** in banners and maintains the **snappy, punchy feel**.\n\n### 4. **Test the Tone Locally**\n- If possible, **run a quick test** with a small group of local users or colleagues to see if the tone feels **authentic and not forced**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udccb **Translation Checklist**\n\n| Step | What to Do |\n|------|------------|\n| \u2705 1. **Identify the core message** | What emotion or result is the customer expressing? |\n| \u2705 2. **Find the local equivalent** | Use a phrase that means the same but sounds natural in the language. |\n| \u2705 3. **Match the tone** | Keep it casual, enthusiastic, or sincere as in the original. |\n| \u2705 4. **Check the word count** | Keep it to 8\u201310 words in the translated language. |\n| \u2705 5. **Get a native speaker to review** | Make sure it reads like something a real person would say. |\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 Bonus Tip: Use Localized Phrases\n\n| English | Swedish | Norwegian |\n|---------|---------|-----------|\n| \"Obsessed\" | *Jag \u00e4r totalt f\u00f6r\u00e4lskad* | *Jeg er virkelig fanget* |\n| \"Worth every krone\" | *V\u00e4rt hela pengarna* | *Verdt hvert krone* |\n| \"Got so many compliments\" | *Fick s\u00e5 mycket ber\u00f6m* | *Fikk masse komplimenter* |\n| \"Finally found\" | *Slutligen hittade jag* | *Endelig fant jeg* |\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udccc Final Thoughts\n\nYou\u2019re already doing the right thing by keeping the testimonials **short, real, and specific** \u2014 that\u2019s the **perfect foundation** for translation. The key is to **adapt the phrases** to sound **natural and genuine in each language**, not just translate them directly.\n\nIf you'd like, I can help you **translate a few of your favorite testimonials** into Swedish and Norwegian \u2014 just share them and I\u2019ll show you how I\u2019d adapt them.\n\nGood luck with the Nordic expansion \u2014 you're off to a great start! \ud83c\udf0e\u2728"
