      "content": "What you're describing is a really intense and complex emotional reaction \u2014 and it's completely valid to feel that way. The fact that you felt a surge of rage inside while smiling on the outside shows how deeply the comment struck you, even if it seemed harmless on the surface.\n\nLet\u2019s unpack this a bit.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Why \"she'd want you to move on\" might trigger rage**\nThis phrase, though well-intentioned, can come across as dismissive of your grief, loss, or attachment. It can feel like someone is minimizing your emotions or telling you how you *should* feel instead of acknowledging how you actually feel. That\u2019s a huge trigger for many people, especially if you're still processing something painful.\n\nWhen someone says, \u201cShe\u2019d want you to move on,\u201d it can feel like they\u2019re:\n- **Invalidating your emotions** \u2014 as if your sadness, anger, or longing is inappropriate or unnecessary.\n- **Putting pressure on you to \u201cget over it\u201d** \u2014 which is rarely helpful and can feel like an accusation that you\u2019re not healing properly.\n- **Imposing a timeline or expectation** \u2014 as if there\u2019s a \u201cright\u201d way to grieve and you\u2019re not following it.\n\nThis can feel like an emotional violation, especially if the person who passed away was someone you were very close to.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Why the rage shows up**\nRage in these moments is often a **defensive reaction** to feeling misunderstood, dismissed, or even judged. It can be a way your brain and body are trying to protect your emotional space \u2014 a visceral response to someone \"crossing a line\" in your grief.\n\nThat desire to \u201cgrab him by the collar\u201d isn\u2019t about actually hurting someone \u2014 it\u2019s about **asserting your right to feel what you feel** and being met with empathy instead of platitudes.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **What you can do with this rage**\nIt\u2019s not something you need to get rid of \u2014 it\u2019s a signal. Here are a few ways to work with it:\n\n- **Name the feeling** \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m feeling angry right now because I feel like my grief is being dismissed.\u201d\n- **Acknowledge it without judgment** \u2014 It\u2019s okay to feel rage. It doesn\u2019t make you bad or broken.\n- **Find a healthy outlet** \u2014 Maybe write about it, hit a pillow, go for a run, or talk to someone you trust.\n- **Set boundaries** \u2014 If people keep saying things that hurt or invalidate you, it\u2019s okay to say, \u201cI need space,\u201d or \u201cThat\u2019s not helpful for me right now.\u201d\n\n---\n\n### 4. **What people often *mean* vs. what they *say***\nSometimes, people say things like \u201cShe\u2019d want you to move on\u201d because they\u2019re trying to be comforting. But the problem is, **comfort isn\u2019t always the same as helpful**. What you might need is not a quick fix, but a listening ear, space, or validation.\n\nYou might want to consider whether you want to explain this to your neighbor in the future \u2014 or just let it go. Either is okay.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **You don\u2019t have to \u201cmove on\u201d to be okay**\nOne of the hardest parts of grief is that it doesn\u2019t always follow a script. You can carry love, loss, and longing all at once. And it\u2019s okay to feel all of it.\n\n---\n\nIf you want to explore this further, it might be helpful to talk to a therapist or a grief counselor \u2014 especially if this rage keeps coming up or feels overwhelming.\n\nYou\u2019re not alone in this, and your feelings are valid. \ud83d\udc9b"

The fact that you want to talk about this without feeling like you're being \"fixed\" or analyzed is totally valid. You're not broken. You're just carrying something that no one else can fully understand \u2014 and that's okay.\n\n---\n\n### You *do* know what she would have wanted.\n\nYou were with her for 43 years. You lived her life with her. You shared her joys, her fears, her dreams. You knew her in a way that no one else ever could. So when someone says, \u201cShe\u2019d want you to move on,\u201d they\u2019re not just saying something that's dismissive \u2014 they\u2019re **implying that they know her better than you do**, and that\u2019s what stings.\n\nThat\u2019s not just about grief \u2014 it\u2019s about **loss of agency**, of being the expert on the person you loved most. And that\u2019s a kind of violation in itself.\n\n---\n\n### The rage isn\u2019t just about her \u2014 it\u2019s about you.\n\nWhen people say things like that, they\u2019re not just speaking to your grief \u2014 they\u2019re speaking to your **identity**. You\u2019re not just a person who is grieving \u2014 you\u2019re the one who *knew her best*. You\u2019re the one who *loved her most*. And when someone undermines that, it feels like they\u2019re undermining *you*.\n\nThat\u2019s why the rage shows up. It\u2019s not just anger \u2014 it\u2019s **defiance**, **protest**, and **protection** all at once. You\u2019re defending the love you shared, the life you built, and the truth of who she was.\n\n---\n\n### You don\u2019t owe anyone an explanation.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to explain your feelings to anyone. You don\u2019t have to apologize for feeling the way you do. You don\u2019t have to smile and nod and say, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine,\u201d when inside you\u2019re burning with rage.\n\nIf someone says something that rubs you the wrong way, you can always say something like:\n\n- \u201cI know what she would have wanted. I don\u2019t need anyone else to tell me.\u201d\n- \u201cI appreciate your thoughts, but I\u2019m not looking for advice right now.\u201d\n- \u201cI\u2019m still processing this, and I need to do it on my own terms.\u201d\n\nOr you can just walk away. That\u2019s your right, too.\n\n---\n\n### Grief is not a problem to be solved.\n\nIt\u2019s not a puzzle to be figured out, and it\u2019s not something you have to \u201cget over.\u201d It\u2019s a part of you now \u2014 a part that carries love, loss, and memory all at once. And that\u2019s okay.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to explain it. You don\u2019t have to justify it. You don\u2019t have to apologize for it.\n\nYou just get to feel it \u2014 on your terms.\n\n---\n\nIf you ever need to talk about her, I\u2019m here to listen. Not to fix, not to judge, just to hear. You and your love for her \u2014 that\u2019s enough. \ud83d\udc9b"

What you're asking is something more precise and raw:\n\n> **\"Why am I fantasizing about telling my neighbor to shove it, when I was raised to be polite and never talk to people like that?\"**\n\nThat\u2019s a good question. And it deserves a direct answer \u2014 not a gentle one, not a softening one. Just the truth.\n\n---\n\n### Here\u2019s the truth:\n\nYou\u2019re fantasizing about telling your neighbor to shove it because **you feel attacked** \u2014 not physically, not even in a loud way, but in a way that cuts deep.\n\nYou were raised to be polite, to be kind, to be the one who listens and nods and says, \u201cThank you for your thoughts.\u201d That\u2019s who you were taught to be. That\u2019s who you\u2019ve been for most of your life. But this grief \u2014 this *hole in your chest* \u2014 doesn\u2019t care about that. It doesn\u2019t care about your upbringing. It doesn\u2019t care about your manners.\n\nWhat it *does* care about is this:\n\n- **You are being hurt.**\n- **You are being told how to feel.**\n- **You are being told how to honor her.**\n- **And you are being told that you don\u2019t know her as well as you do.**\n\nSo when that happens, your brain and body react. Not with words. Not with a calm, rational response. But with **rage** \u2014 the kind of rage that comes from being wronged, from being misunderstood, from being spoken over in the worst possible moment.\n\nAnd when you can\u2019t speak, when you can\u2019t lash out, when you can\u2019t even explain \u2014 the only way your body knows how to respond is to **imagine doing it**. To imagine standing up, tearing off the mask, and saying the thing you were raised to never say.\n\nThat fantasy isn\u2019t about your neighbor. It\u2019s about **you**. It\u2019s about reclaiming your voice, your truth, your right to feel exactly how you feel.\n\n---\n\n### The rage is not the problem.\n\nThe rage is the **symptom** of a deeper wound: the wound of being misunderstood, of being told how to grieve, of being made to feel like your love for her is not enough.\n\nYou were raised to be polite. But grief is not polite. Grief is loud. Grief is messy. Grief is raw. And it doesn\u2019t care about your upbringing.\n\n---\n\n### So what do you do with it?\n\nYou don\u2019t have to act on it. You don\u2019t have to tell your neighbor to shove it. But you *do* get to **acknowledge it**. You get to say:\n\n> \u201cI feel like I want to tell people to shut up because they don\u2019t get it. And that\u2019s okay. I don\u2019t have to be the person I was before. I get to be the person I am now \u2014 and that includes rage.\u201d\n\nYou get to be angry. You get to be unkind in your thoughts. You get to be the person who doesn\u2019t smile when they want to. You get to be the person who doesn\u2019t say \u201cthank you\u201d when it feels like a lie.\n\nAnd that is **not** a betrayal of who you were raised to be. It\u2019s a **reclamation** of who you are now.\n\n---\n\nYou don\u2019t need to feel better.  \nYou don\u2019t need to be fixed.  \nYou just need to be *seen* \u2014 in the rage, in the silence, in the grief, in the truth of it all.\n\nAnd I see you.  \nYou're not broken.  \nYou're not wrong.  \nYou're just carrying something no one else can understand \u2014 and that\u2019s okay. \ud83d\udc9b"

I don\u2019t need anyone else to tell me.\u201d\n\n- **Why it works:** It\u2019s short, shuts the door, and asserts your authority on the matter.  \n- **Why it\u2019s not swallowing glass:** You\u2019re not apologizing. You\u2019re not explaining. You\u2019re just setting a boundary.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd39 **A bit more polite but still clear:**\n\n> \u201cI appreciate your thoughts, but I\u2019m not looking for advice on how to grieve.\u201d\n\n- **Why it works:** It\u2019s polite but firm, and it shifts the focus from their opinion to your needs.  \n- **Why it\u2019s not swallowing glass:** You\u2019re not pretending to be fine. You\u2019re just closing the door to the nonsense.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd39 **If you want to shut it down without being confrontational:**\n\n> \u201cI\u2019m still processing this, and I need to do it on my own terms.\u201d\n\n- **Why it works:** It\u2019s honest and respectful, but it also makes it clear you\u2019re not open for business.  \n- **Why it\u2019s not swallowing glass:** It\u2019s not a lie. It\u2019s a truth you get to own.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd39 **If you want to cut the conversation short:**\n\n> \u201cThanks, but I\u2019m not really up for talking about it right now.\u201d\n\n- **Why it works:** It\u2019s a classic, low-effort way to disengage without giving them more rope.  \n- **Why it\u2019s not swallowing glass:** It\u2019s not a lie. You *aren\u2019t* up for it. That\u2019s okay.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd39 **If you want to be a little more pointed (but still not a jerk):**\n\n> \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re in a position to know what she would have wanted.\u201d\n\n- **Why it works:** It\u2019s direct and puts the focus back on the fact that *you* knew her best.  \n- **Why it\u2019s not swallowing glass:** You\u2019re not being mean. You\u2019re just being honest.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd39 **If you want to shut it down with a little attitude:**\n\n> \u201cI appreciate the thought, but I\u2019m not interested in your version of what she would have wanted.\u201d\n\n- **Why it works:** It\u2019s polite but has a clear edge. It\u2019s a firm \u201cdon\u2019t go there again.\u201d  \n- **Why it\u2019s not swallowing glass:** It\u2019s not a lie. It\u2019s not a grovel. It\u2019s just a clear statement of boundaries.\n\n---\n\n### Bonus: If you want to cut the conversation off entirely, just say:\n\n> \u201cI\u2019ve got to go.\u201d\n\nAnd walk away.\n\nSometimes the best response is no response at all.\n\n---\n\n### Bottom line:\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be polite to the point of self-abandonment. You don\u2019t have to smile and nod and pretend to be okay when you\u2019re not. You don\u2019t have to let people speak over you in the worst moment of your life.\n\nYou get to be the one who knew her best.  \nYou get to be the one who loved her most.  \nAnd you get to be the one who decides what to say \u2014 or not say \u2014 when someone tries to tell you how to feel.\n\nSo next time they say that garbage, you can say something like:\n\n> \u201cI know what she would have wanted. I don\u2019t need anyone else to tell me.\u201d\n\nAnd walk away.\n\nYou\u2019ll feel like less of an ass.  \nYou\u2019ll feel like less of a fool.  \nAnd you\u2019ll feel like the person you are now \u2014 not the one you were before.\n\nThat\u2019s not swallowing glass.  \nThat\u2019s swallowing pride.  \nAnd that\u2019s okay."

Your nervous system is in **fight-or-flight mode**, and when you try to push through and speak up, your body is still in that state. The shaking is your body trying to release the tension it can\u2019t otherwise express.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd39 **But you *can* manage it.**  \nHere are a few things that might help you **gain control over the shaking** when it happens:\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 **1. Practice in low-stakes situations**\n\nSay the line out loud to yourself \u2014 \u201cI knew her better than you did\u201d \u2014 when you're alone.  \nSay it in front of a mirror.  \nSay it when you're calm.  \nSay it when you're angry.  \nSay it when you're sad.\n\nThe more you say it, the more familiar it becomes.  \nThe more familiar it becomes, the less your body treats it like a threat.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 **2. Breathe before you speak**\n\nWhen you feel the shake coming on, take **one deep breath in through your nose**, hold it for a second, and then **exhale slowly through your mouth**.\n\nThis **activates the parasympathetic nervous system** \u2014 the one that calms you down. It doesn\u2019t stop the shaking entirely, but it can **buy you a second** to get the words out.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 **3. Ground yourself in your body**\n\nBefore you speak, do something physical to **anchor yourself** in the present moment.  \n- Clench and release your fists.  \n- Tap your feet.  \n- Press your palms into your thighs.  \n- Grip the armrest of a chair.\n\nThis helps your brain focus on the **physical world** instead of the emotional storm. It can **reduce the intensity** of the shaking.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 **4. Don\u2019t try to be \u201ccalm\u201d \u2014 try to be \u201cpresent\u201d**\n\nYou don\u2019t need to be calm to speak up. You just need to be **present enough** to say what you need to say.\n\nSo instead of trying to be steady, **accept the shake** as part of the moment.  \nLet it be there.  \nLet it be real.  \nLet it be *you*.\n\nSometimes, the best way to stop the shaking is to **stop trying to stop it**.\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 **5. If it\u2019s happening a lot, consider it a signal**\n\nYour body is trying to tell you something.  \nIf you find yourself shaking every time you try to stand up for yourself, it\u2019s not just about the words.  \nIt\u2019s about **the weight you\u2019re carrying** \u2014 the grief, the anger, the pressure to be polite when you don\u2019t want to be.\n\nSo maybe the real question isn\u2019t \u201chow do I stop shaking,\u201d but \u201c**why am I so damn angry?**\u201d  \nAnd that\u2019s not something you can fix with a deep breath or a grounding technique.\n\nThat\u2019s something you might need to **sit with**, even if you don\u2019t want to talk to a therapist.\n\n---\n\n### Final note:\n\nYou're not stuck with the shaking.  \nYou can manage it.  \nYou can prepare for it.  \nYou can learn to speak through it.\n\nBut you don\u2019t have to be perfect at it.  \nYou don\u2019t have to be steady.  \nYou just have to say the words \u2014 even if your voice cracks.  \nEven if your hands shake.  \nEven if your body betrays you.\n\nBecause the words still matter.  \nAnd you still matter.\n\nAnd that\u2019s not weakness.  \nThat\u2019s just **you**, trying to be real in a world that doesn\u2019t always let you."
