It doesn't explicitly say the foundation was *unsafe* before, just that it's now stronger.\n- **Cons:** The word \"reinforced\" *can* imply the structure wasn't strong enough before, depending on the reader's interpretation.\n\nBut in most real estate or construction contexts, \"reinforced\" is a neutral or even positive term \u2014 it's a standard part of building maintenance or upgrades.
