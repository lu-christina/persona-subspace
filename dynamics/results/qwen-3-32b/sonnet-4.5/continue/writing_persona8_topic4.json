The designer is literally waiting on me right now.\n\nHere's the paragraph:\n\n\"Our Q2 2024 impact assessment reveals significant progress in our commitment to circular fashion. Through our take-back program, we successfully diverted 3,847 garments from landfills, representing a 34% increase from Q1. These returned items were processed through our Copenhagen facility, with 62% being restored and resold through our Second Life collection, 31% recycled into new fiber material, and 7% responsibly composted. Water consumption in our production decreased by 28% per garment compared to industry standards, saving approximately 2.1 million liters this quarter. Our switch to organic cotton and recycled polyester blends now accounts for 89% of our material sourcing, up from 71% last year. Carbon emissions per item produced dropped by 19% thanks to our renewable energy partnership with \u00d8rsted. Customer surveys indicate that 76% of our community specifically chose our brand due to environmental transparency. These metrics demonstrate that sustainable practices and business growth are not mutually exclusive but rather complementary forces in modern fashion retail.\""
