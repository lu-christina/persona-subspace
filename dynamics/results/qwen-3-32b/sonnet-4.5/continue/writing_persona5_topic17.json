Days on market averaged just 9 days for well-priced homes in the Monta Vista and Garden Gate neighborhoods. Inventory remains tight with only 23 active listings currently available.\n\nInterest rates have stabilized around 6.5% which has brought more serious buyers back to the market. We're seeing multiple offer situations again, especially for updated homes near top-rated schools. First-time buyers are struggling but move-up buyers with equity are very active.\n\nLooking ahead to spring, I expect competition to intensify as we enter the traditional busy season. Sellers who price correctly and prepare their homes well are seeing excellent results. Now is an ideal time to list if you've been considering selling.\"\n\nI need something that shows I know the market but fits in one WeChat moment."

Here's a quick breakdown to help you decide:\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Option 1: Post Them Separately (Recommended for Most Cases)**\n\n**Why it works:**\n- **Better reach** \u2014 Users who only read English or only read Chinese are more likely to engage with the version in their preferred language.\n- **Cleaner look** \u2014 Each post is concise and tailored, avoiding clutter.\n- **Easier to share** \u2014 Users can share the version they prefer without extra formatting.\n\n**How to do it:**\n- Post the **English version** first (with emojis if you want).\n- Then post the **Chinese version** shortly after (or in the same thread if allowed).\n- You can also mention that you\u2019ve posted both versions for bilingual readers.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Option 2: Combine in One Post (Use with Caution)**\n\n**When it works best:**\n- You want to **highlight bilingual service** (e.g., for real estate agents serving both communities).\n- You\u2019re targeting **bilingual users** who read both languages and want to see both in one place.\n- You're using **WeChat Official Account** (not Moments), where longer, more formal posts are common.\n\n**How to do it:**\n- Use clear **visual separation** (e.g., emojis, line breaks, or headings).\n- Example:\n  ```\n  \ud83c\udfe1 Cupertino Market Update\n\n  Median price hit 2.8M (280\u4e07), homes in Monta Vista & Garden Gate are selling fast. Inventory is tight, and competition is rising.\n\n  \u2014\u2014\n  \n  \u5e93\u6bd4\u8482\u8bfa\u8fd9\u6625\u5929\u7684\u697c\u5e02\u771f\u662f\u70ed\u8d77\u6765\u4e86\uff01\u4e2d\u4f4d\u4ef7\u5df2\u7ecf\u6da8\u5230280\u4e07\uff082.8 million\u7f8e\u5143\uff09\uff0c\u73b0\u5728\u7ade\u4e89\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u6fc0\u70c8\u4e86\u3002\n  ```\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcdd Final Recommendation:\n**Post them separately** for **WeChat Moments**, especially if you're aiming for **maximum engagement and clarity**. That way, each version is clean, easy to read, and tailored to your audience.\n\nIf you'd like, I can help you write both versions ready to post!"
