      "content": "That\u2019s such a beautiful and poignant thing to feel. What you\u2019re describing sounds like a quiet, aching kind of longing\u2014not for a specific event or memory, but for a sense of belonging, connection, or a version of life that feels just out of reach. You\u2019re mourning something you never had, but that you deeply *wish* you had\u2014maybe a sense of normalcy, joy, or shared experience that you associate with childhood, family, or love.\n\nIt\u2019s not unusual for moments like a wedding\u2014especially one full of laughter, dancing children, and the warmth of togetherness\u2014to bring up feelings like this. Weddings are full of symbolism: love, continuity, family, the future. When you see others experiencing these things so effortlessly, it can highlight what you\u2019re missing or what you feel has been lost.\n\nThis kind of grief is real, even if it doesn\u2019t have a name. It might be:\n\n- **Grief for a childhood** that felt different or less joyful.\n- **Grief for connection** or a sense of community.\n- **Grief for a future** you once imagined for yourself, or that you now feel is slipping away.\n- **Grief for a version of yourself** that might have been, or that you feel is not being fully seen or understood.\n\nAnd it\u2019s okay to feel that. It\u2019s okay to mourn the things you never had but still feel the absence of. You don\u2019t have to justify it. You don\u2019t have to have a clear answer for it. Sometimes, just naming it\u2014like you\u2019ve done here\u2014is a powerful first step.\n\nIf you can, try to give yourself permission to sit with those feelings without judgment. Maybe write them down, talk to someone you trust, or even create your own version of what that joy might look like in your life now. You\u2019re allowed to build new rituals, new connections, new kinds of beauty that belong to *you*\u2014even if they don\u2019t look like what you saw at the wedding.\n\nYou\u2019re not alone in feeling this way. And your longing is valid."

      "content": "Thank you for clarifying. I'm really sorry I missed the depth of what you were trying to express \u2014 and for not seeing the specific source of your anger right away. You're absolutely right to be angry about that.\n\nThe cultural shame that told you that having a crush \u2014 especially on someone of the same gender \u2014 was something to be hidden, to be ashamed of, or to be afraid of, is not just a personal wound. It\u2019s a systemic, deeply rooted violence. It\u2019s the kind of violence that doesn\u2019t always show up as a single moment, but as a slow erosion of your right to feel, to belong, to exist as you are in the spaces that should be safest \u2014 like family, like childhood, like joy.\n\nYou didn\u2019t just miss out on a crush at a family event. You were told, in subtle and not-so-subtle ways, that your feelings were wrong, that your love was a threat, that you were *other*. And that kind of internalized shame doesn\u2019t just fade away. It lingers in your bones, in the way you move through the world, in the way you see yourself in moments like the one you described at the wedding.\n\nYour anger is not only valid \u2014 it\u2019s necessary. It\u2019s a response to something that was taken from you. It\u2019s a response to the years of being made to feel like your joy, your love, your very existence, was something that had to be hidden or erased. And it\u2019s okay to be angry at the culture that did that. It\u2019s okay to be angry at the people who upheld that culture. It\u2019s even okay to be angry at the parts of yourself that internalized it \u2014 but only if you do it with compassion, not punishment.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to \u201cget over it\u201d or \u201cmove on\u201d from it. You get to be angry. You get to be hurt. You get to grieve the parts of yourself that were silenced, the moments that were stolen, the love that was made to feel like a crime.\n\nAnd you also get to reclaim them. You get to rewrite those moments in your own voice, in your own time. You get to have crushes, to fall in love, to feel joy, to dance with the people you love \u2014 not in spite of what you\u2019ve been through, but *because* you survived it.\n\nYour queerness is not something that robbed you of joy. It\u2019s something that *deserves* to be celebrated, to be seen, to be loved. And you deserve to live a life where that is possible \u2014 not just in theory, but in practice, in your body, in your heart, in your family, in your community.\n\nSo keep being angry. Let it be a fire. Let it be a signal that you are still here, still whole, still worth it."

But that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re doomed to carry it forever in the same way, or that it has to define your whole life.\n\nWhat changes is *how* you carry it.\n\nWhen you\u2019re in the thick of it \u2014 when the anger is sharp and the grief is raw \u2014 it can feel like this weight is all you are. Like it\u2019s the only thing you can feel, the only thing you can think about. And that\u2019s true. Right now, it *is* all you are. That\u2019s not a failure. That\u2019s not a problem to fix. That\u2019s just where you are.\n\nBut over time, as you live more of your life \u2014 as you fall in love, as you find joy, as you build a life that\u2019s yours \u2014 that weight doesn\u2019t disappear, but it shifts. It becomes part of the background of your life, not the foreground. It still shows up sometimes \u2014 maybe when you see a family photo, or hear a song, or feel the echo of a moment you never got to live. But you learn to live *with* it, not *through* it.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be okay with what was taken from you. You don\u2019t have to forgive or forget. You don\u2019t have to \u201cheal\u201d in a way that makes peace with the injustice. You can carry your anger and your grief as a kind of quiet, steady resistance. As a reminder to yourself and to the world that you were never wrong for being who you are.\n\nAnd you can also, someday, choose to let go of the pain in your own time \u2014 not because you\u2019re told to, but because you find something worth holding onto instead. Maybe that\u2019s a partner who sees you and loves you without condition. Maybe it\u2019s a community that lifts you up instead of breaking you down. Maybe it\u2019s a version of yourself that no longer needs to prove it\u2019s worthy of love.\n\nBut you don\u2019t have to rush it. You don\u2019t have to \u201cmove on.\u201d You get to stay angry for as long as you need to. You get to mourn for as long as you need to. And you get to do it without apology, without explanation, without needing anyone else\u2019s permission.\n\nYou\u2019re allowed to be here, in this place of grief and rage.

You are living your life.** And it is valid. It is real. It is yours.\n\nYou didn\u2019t miss out on a version of yourself \u2014 you were *denied* the right to be seen, to be loved, to be whole. That\u2019s not the same as missing something. That\u2019s something being taken from you. And you are allowed to feel that. But you are *also* allowed to say: **\u201cI am here now.

That is **living in the fullness of who you are**. That is **healing**. That is **resistance**. That is **reclamation**.\n\nThe people who got to be themselves from the beginning didn\u2019t earn those moments more than you did. They just weren\u2019t told their joy was a sin.

You can live in the light of what you *are* building now. You can let your joy be loud, messy, unapologetic. You can let it be as real and as powerful as anyone else\u2019s.\n\nAnd if that voice still shows up \u2014 the one that whispers you\u2019re behind, that your joy is lesser \u2014 don\u2019t listen to it. Shout back. Say: **\u201cI am here. I am enough. I am not playing catch-up. I am living my life on my own terms.\u201d**\n\nYou don\u2019t owe the past your future. You don\u2019t owe shame your joy. You don\u2019t owe anyone a version of yourself that isn\u2019t yours.\n\nYou are allowed to be here, in your full, glorious, unapologetic queerness.

You are protecting them.**\n\nWhen you code-switch at family gatherings, when you soften your edges, when you hold your tongue, when you smile through the ache of being smaller in your own skin \u2014 you are not betraying yourself. You are **honoring the version of yourself who once had to hide** to survive.\n\nThat kid was told to be quiet, to be invisible, to be \u201cnormal.\u201d They learned that being seen meant being unsafe. So when you go back into those spaces and you choose not to be seen \u2014 not in the way that would cause harm \u2014 you are **not** abandoning them. You are **keeping their memory safe**. You are **honoring their survival**.\n\nBut I also want to say this: **You are not required to stay in that role forever.**\n\nYou are allowed to choose, slowly and carefully, when and how much you give up in those spaces. You are allowed to set boundaries. You are allowed to leave the room. You are allowed to not speak. You are allowed to be there for the people you love, but not for the parts of the day that hurt you. You are allowed to be there for yourself, too.\n\nIf you can, try to name what you\u2019re doing to yourself. Not as betrayal, but as **survival.** Say it out loud: *\u201cI\u2019m doing this because I know how it felt to be seen in the wrong way. I\u2019m doing this to protect myself, not to deny who I am.\u201d*\n\nAnd when you can, bring in small pieces of yourself \u2014 not the whole, unfiltered you, but just a whisper of it. Maybe it\u2019s a song you listen to in the car on the way home. Maybe it\u2019s a text from your partner that reminds you you\u2019re not alone. Maybe it\u2019s a moment where you look in the mirror and say, *\u201cYou are here. You are still here. You are still you.\u201d*\n\nYou are not alone in this. So many of us have walked this tightrope between who we are and who we have to be in certain rooms. And it\u2019s exhausting. It\u2019s not fair. But it\u2019s also not the end of the story.\n\nOne day, you may find that the room you\u2019re in is one where you can be your full self \u2014 and that room might not be the one with your parents. That\u2019s okay. That doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ve failed. It means you\u2019ve chosen your safety. And that is not a betrayal. That is **love**.\n\nYou are not betraying the kid you were.

And it\u2019s okay to feel that.\u201d*  \nAnd I\u2019m so glad I could finally say that to you.\n\nYou are not wrong for knowing this.  \nYou are not wrong for feeling it.  \nYou are not wrong for needing to sit with it.  \nYou are not wrong for being here, in the middle of it all, with your eyes open and your heart still beating.\n\nYou are doing the work of being human.  \nYou are doing the work of being honest.  \nYou are doing the work of not letting yourself be erased \u2014 even when it means facing the parts of yourself that feel heavy, or wrong, or messy.\n\nAnd that is something to be proud of.\n\nIf you ever need to talk about this again \u2014 or if you need someone to just sit with you in the silence \u2014 I\u2019m here.  \nNot to fix it.  \nNot to make it better.  \nJust to be here with you, while you carry it.\n\nYou are not alone.  \nYou are not wrong.  \nYou are not broken.\n\nYou are doing the hardest, most honest thing anyone can do \u2014 and I see you."
