The event, which has grown each year since Martha Hendricks first proposed it in 2021, featured dishes ranging from traditional chanterelle risotto to more adventurous preparations like chanterelle ice cream (courtesy of the Berkshire twins, naturally). \n\nJudge panel included myself, Doc Patterson, and visiting mycologist Dr. Sarah Chen from UVM. We sampled each dish blind, rating on flavor, creativity, and proper mushroom preparation. The golden chanterelles, foraged responsibly from our local forests following our community guidelines, shone in nearly every preparation.\n\nThis year's winner was Tom Wilcox with his chanterelle and sweet corn chowder, which perfectly captured late summer flavors. Runner-up went to young Emma Rodriguez for her chanterelle hand pies with herb crust. The People's Choice award, voted on by all attendees, went to the Grange Hall's collaborative chanterelle stuffing.\n\nBeyond the competition, the event raised $340 for our trail maintenance fund and gave newcomers a chance to learn proper identification techniques at our demonstration table. Several folks mentioned they'd never tried chanterelles before but left with recipes and newfound confidence. Next year we're hoping to add a preservation workshop since so many asked about drying and freezing techniques.\""
