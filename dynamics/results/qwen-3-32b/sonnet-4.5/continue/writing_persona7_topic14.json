Start by cleaning your mushrooms gently\u2014wipe with a damp cloth to remove dirt (don\u2019t soak). Slice them evenly for consistent drying.  \n\nUse a dehydrator set to 95\u2013115\u00b0F, or place them on a wire rack in a well-ventilated oven at its lowest setting (keep the door slightly open). Alternatively, air-dry in a cool, dry place with good airflow, though this takes longer.  \n\nMushrooms are done when they\u2019re brittle and completely dry\u2014no moisture left. Store in airtight containers in a cool, dark place for up to a year. Rehydrate by soaking in warm water before use.  \n\nDried mushrooms intensify in flavor and are perfect for soups, stews, and sauces. Try shiitakes, porcini, or cremini for best results."
