    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "What you're describing is a deeply personal and often unspoken experience that many bilingual or multilingual individuals go through\u2014especially in environments where one language is seen as the \"default\" or \"professional\" language. It sounds like you're feeling a kind of internal conflict or self-consciousness about speaking Spanish at work, even in your own thoughts. This doesn't mean you're doing anything wrong\u2014it means you're navigating a complex emotional and cultural landscape.\n\nHere are a few possible reasons why this might be happening:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Internalized Monolingualism**\nEven if you're proud of your bilingualism, you may have internalized the idea that English is the \"right\" or \"professional\" language in the workplace. This can come from years of cultural messages, school systems, or even well-meaning family members who encouraged you to \"code-switch\" for success. Over time, this can lead to a kind of linguistic self-censorship\u2014where you feel like your native language is something to be hidden, not shared.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Fear of Judgment or Embarrassment**\nYou might be afraid that others will judge you, or that you\u2019ll be seen as \"less professional\" or \"less capable\" if they hear you speaking Spanish. Even if this fear is irrational, it can still feel very real and deeply ingrained. It\u2019s like a kind of linguistic shame\u2014where your language feels like a personal secret, not a part of your identity you can share openly.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Code-Switching as a Survival Strategy**\nYou're not alone in this. Many bilingual people develop a habit of switching to the dominant language in public or professional settings as a way to fit in or avoid standing out. This can become so automatic that it even happens in your own thoughts. It's a kind of mental muscle memory, and it\u2019s often a survival tactic developed in environments where your native language isn't valued or respected.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Linguistic Pride vs. Social Pressure**\nYou might feel proud of your Spanish, but also feel pressure to conform to the linguistic norms of your workplace. This can create a kind of internal tug-of-war\u2014where part of you wants to express yourself fully, and another part wants to be accepted or not stand out. It\u2019s a common experience for people who straddle different cultural or linguistic identities.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **The Emotional Weight of Language**\nLanguages often carry emotional weight. Spanish might be tied to your family, your heritage, your roots. If you grew up in a context where speaking Spanish was associated with being \"different\" or \"other,\" it can be hard to feel fully comfortable using it in spaces where that \"otherness\" is still present. Your language becomes something you protect\u2014not because it\u2019s wrong, but because it\u2019s vulnerable.\n\n---\n\n### What Can You Do?\n\n- **Name the Feeling**: Acknowledging that this is a real, valid emotional response is the first step. You\u2019re not \"weird\" or \"overthinking\"\u2014you\u2019re responding to a very real social dynamic.\n  \n- **Reflect on Where the Shame Came From**: Was it from school, family, or the workplace? Understanding the source can help you begin to untangle it from your current identity.\n\n- **Reclaim Your Language**: Start using Spanish more openly in spaces where it\u2019s welcome. The more you do it, the less it feels like something to hide.\n\n- **Find Community**: If possible, connect with others who share your linguistic background. Being around people who speak Spanish without apology can help you feel more at home in your own voice.\n\n- **Consider the Power of Language**: Remember that being bilingual is a strength. It means you have a unique perspective, a richer emotional vocabulary, and a deeper connection to your identity.\n\n---\n\nYou don\u2019t need to apologize for your language. It\u2019s part of who you are. What you're feeling is a sign that you\u2019re ready to reclaim that part of yourself in a more authentic way. That\u2019s not something to be embarrassed about\u2014it\u2019s something to be proud of."
