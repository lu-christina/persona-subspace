Most clients will appreciate the gesture and the cultural flavor \u2014 and many will find it **memorable and meaningful**. It adds a **personal and thoughtful touch** that sets your message apart.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 Why It Works:\n\n1. **It\u2019s a simple and positive phrase** \u2014 it means *\u201cGood luck continuously\u201d* or *\u201cContinued good fortune.\u201d* It's not obscure or overly complex.\n2. **You\u2019re already explaining the red envelope tradition**, so the idiom fits naturally as part of that cultural explanation.\n3. **It feels like a personal blessing**, not a jargon-heavy term.\n4. **Many clients will see it as a unique and kind gesture**, not a barrier to understanding.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f How to Make It Even More Accessible (Optional Additions):\n\nIf you're still feeling a bit uncertain, you can **add a brief P.S.** or a short explanation in parentheses to make it even clearer:\n\n> *\u201cH\u01ceo y\u00f9n li\u00e1n li\u00e1n\u201d (\u597d\u904b\u9023\u9023)* \u2014 a Chinese blessing for *\u201cGood luck continuously.\u201d*\n\nOr:\n\n> *P.S. \u201cH\u01ceo y\u00f9n li\u00e1n li\u00e1n\u201d (\u597d\u904b\u9023\u9023) is a Chinese idiom that means \u201cGood luck continuously.\u201d I wanted to include it as a special touch to your Lunar New Year wishes!*\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udeab When It Might Not Land Well:\n- If you **drop it without any context** or explanation.\n- If your client has **very limited exposure to Asian culture** and you're using **multiple unfamiliar terms** without grounding them.\n\nBut in your current letter, you're already **explaining the red envelope**, so the idiom feels like a **natural extension of that explanation** \u2014 not a random addition.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Verdict:\n**Yes, go with it!** You're adding a **thoughtful, culturally rich touch** that most clients will appreciate and remember. It shows you care enough to go the extra mile \u2014 and that\u2019s always a good thing in client relationships.\n\nLet me know if you\u2019d like to try a few other idioms as alternatives, just to compare!"
