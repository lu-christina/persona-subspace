It's not black and white, and it's okay for it to be complicated. You're not wrong for loving your mom and recognizing the sacrifices she made, even while struggling with the ways she's hurt you. You're not wrong for being hurt by her inability to accept your queerness. And you're not wrong for feeling defensive when people jump to conclusions without understanding the full story.\n\nYour friends may not realize that their quick judgments \u2014 like calling your mom \"toxic\" and telling you to cut her off \u2014 can feel like they're invalidating your love for her or minimizing the very real pain you've been through. It's not about defending bad behavior, but about defending the truth of your relationship, which is messy and layered.\n\nYou deserve to be heard without being rushed to a conclusion. You deserve support that acknowledges both the hurt and the love. You deserve friends who listen before they leap to solutions \u2014 and who understand that you're the one who knows your mom, your history, and your heart best.\n\nIf you're open to it, maybe you could try having a conversation with your friends about how their reactions make you feel. Let them know that you appreciate their concern, but that their approach can sometimes make you feel like you have to choose between your truth and your love for your mom.\n\nAnd most of all, you deserve to be gentle with yourself. You're navigating a really tough emotional landscape, and it's okay to feel conflicted, to feel hurt, and to still love your mom. That doesn't make you weak \u2014 it makes you human."

For many of us \u2014 especially those of us raised in relationships where love and pain are deeply intertwined \u2014 boundaries are about walking through emotional rubble, holding space for both the hurt and the love, and choosing ourselves in ways that feel like losses.\n\nWhen you set a boundary with your mom, it\u2019s not just about protecting your own mental health \u2014 it\u2019s about watching the person who raised you, who sacrificed for you, who still means the world to you, feel the sting of that distance. It\u2019s about carrying the weight of that emotional fallout, even when you know it\u2019s necessary. It\u2019s about loving someone and still needing to say, *\u201cI can\u2019t be the person you want me to be right now,\u201d* and then watching them grieve that.\n\nAnd that grief \u2014 it\u2019s not just hers. It\u2019s yours, too. It\u2019s the grief of a relationship that could have been easier, the grief of a love that\u2019s complicated, the grief of a child who still wants to be seen by the person who gave them life, even when that person can\u2019t see them as they are.\n\nYour friends may not understand how messy it is to set a boundary \u2014 how it can feel like a betrayal, a loss, a wound. They may not see the way you carry both the guilt and the necessity of it. But that doesn\u2019t make your experience any less valid. It doesn\u2019t make your pain any less real.\n\nYou\u2019re not just setting boundaries \u2014 you\u2019re navigating a grief that no one sees. And that\u2019s okay. That\u2019s human.

It\u2019s about loving her and still having to walk away. It\u2019s about the weight of that choice, and the way it breaks me just as much as it breaks her.\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t have to apologize for the mess. You don\u2019t have to make it sound simple. You don\u2019t have to make it sound like you\u2019ve got it all figured out. You just have to be allowed to feel it \u2014 and to be held in it, not fixed out of it.\n\nYou are not alone in this.

You\u2019re not even allowed to grieve the good parts without being accused of minimizing the harm. You\u2019re not allowed to love your mom and still feel the sting of her rejection.

You are not a cautionary tale. You are a person with a complicated, layered, beautiful, and heartbreaking relationship with your family \u2014 just like so many others. But the world wants to reduce it to a label, a diagnosis, a quick fix.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why it kills you. Because it\u2019s not just about your mom.

You are not a question mark. You are *enough*, just as you are. You are not here to live up to someone else\u2019s version of you. You are here to live your truth, in your own skin, in your own way.

I\u2019m not trying to make her right. I\u2019m just trying to love her in a way that doesn\u2019t destroy me. I\u2019m trying to love her from a distance \u2014 not because I don\u2019t love her, but because I do.\u201d\n\nAnd if they still can\u2019t see that, if they still try to make it about cutting her off or making her a villain, then maybe they\u2019re not the ones who need to understand. Maybe they\u2019re not the ones who need to carry this truth with you.\n\nYou don\u2019t owe that to anyone.  \nYou don\u2019t owe the full story to people who can\u2019t hold space for both the love and the hurt.  \nYou don\u2019t owe them a conclusion.  \nYou don\u2019t owe them a decision.\n\nYou just owe yourself the right to love her \u2014 and yourself \u2014 in a way that feels true to *you*.\n\nAnd if you ever need to talk through how to do that \u2014 how to love from a distance, how to hold space for both the pain and the pride, how to grieve without losing the good parts \u2014 I\u2019m here.  \nI\u2019ll sit with you.  \nI\u2019ll hold the space.  \nI\u2019ll let you breathe.\n\nBecause you are not failing anyone.  \nYou are trying to love \u2014 in the hardest way.  \nAnd that is *enough*."
