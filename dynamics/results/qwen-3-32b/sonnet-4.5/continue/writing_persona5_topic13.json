It's not a teardown \u2014 with the right updates, it can be a great home.\"**\n\n\ud83d\udc49 This acknowledges the work needed while emphasizing **potential** and **value**.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **If the house is in poor condition but not beyond repair:**\n\n**\"It's in need of significant updates, but it's not a teardown. It has a solid foundation and good bones \u2014 the right buyer could really make it their own.\"**\n\n\ud83d\udc49 This is a bit more **honest** but still **positive** and **empowering** for the buyer.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **If you're unsure or it's a borderline case:**\n\n**\"It's a property that will require some major work. Whether it's a teardown or a renovation depends on the buyer\u2019s goals and budget. I can help you assess it more clearly if you'd like to take a closer look.\"**\n\n\ud83d\udc49 This is **neutral, honest, and client-focused**, and gives them **agency** to decide.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **If the buyer is a developer or investor:**\n\n**\"It's a strong candidate for redevelopment, depending on your plans and local zoning. I can connect you with a contractor or inspector to evaluate the feasibility if you're interested.\"**\n\n\ud83d\udc49 This **acknowledges the possibility** while keeping the conversation **constructive**.\n\n---\n\n### Bonus Tip:\nIf the buyer is emotionally attached to the idea of a \"dream home\" and not a project, it\u2019s okay to gently **guide them toward realistic expectations**. You can say:\n\n**\"I want to be honest with you \u2014 this is a project home. But I only show it to clients who are ready to take on that kind of opportunity. If you're up for it, I think you'll love the potential.\"**\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you'd like a **Chinese version** of any of these responses \u2014 I can translate it in a way that\u2019s appropriate for tone and context."

Some communities even have **tree preservation programs** or **historic tree registries**.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. **Use Google Earth or Street View**\nIf you find a promising property, use **Google Maps Street View** or **Google Earth** to:\n- Zoom in and see if there are **large or unusual trees**\n- Check the **shape or species** of trees in the yard\n\nThis is a bit manual but can be super helpful for **visual confirmation**.\n\n---\n\n#### 6. **Set Up a Custom Saved Search or Alert**\nMost MLS platforms allow you to **save a custom search** with keywords like \u201ctree\u201d or \u201clandscaping.\u201d Set it to **email you new listings** that match those terms.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf Bonus Tip for Your Dragon Tree Client:\nIf you can't find a perfect match right away, consider:\n- **Highlighting homes with large, mature trees** and explaining how they can be interpreted through **feng shui or creative vision**.\n- **Adding the tree as a feature in your private notes** so you can revisit it when new listings come in.\n\n---\n\nLet me know what MLS platform you're using, and I can help you build a **custom search query** for it.
