Through iterative processes of making and unmaking, I seek to destabilize conventional notions of authorship in an age of algorithmic production. The works emerge from a dialogue between hand and machine, where imperfections become sites of resistance against the homogenizing forces of late capitalism. By foregrounding the labor obscured in both artisanal and automated processes, I aim to reveal the ideological structures that determine what we value as 'authentic' creation. Each piece functions as both object and critique, inviting viewers to reconsider their relationship to the commodified image. My recent series explores how digital tools can be weaponized against their intended purpose, using glitch aesthetics to expose the violence inherent in seamless interfaces. The resulting artifacts occupy an ambiguous territory\u2014neither fully digital nor analog, neither wholly intentional nor accidental. This ambiguity is central to my inquiry into how we construct meaning in a post-internet landscape where the boundaries between maker, tool, and viewer have become increasingly porous.\""
