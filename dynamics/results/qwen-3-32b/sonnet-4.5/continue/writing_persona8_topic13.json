You can add interactive elements like **polls** or **\"Guess what's coming\"** stickers.\n- **How to post:** Use the same video or a short clip with the emoji + text combo.\n\n### 3. **Pinterest**\n- **Why?** If your linen collection is on the **cozy, home, or lifestyle** side, Pinterest is a goldmine for long-term traffic and brand discovery.\n- **How to post:** Use a still image from your video with the text overlaid (e.g., \u201cSoft, Not Fast\u201d + emojis). Make sure the image is **vertical** and **high quality**.\n\n### 4. **TikTok (obviously!)**\n- **Why?** TikTok is your main stage \u2014 the caption and vibe are perfect for the platform\u2019s **trendy, playful, and visual** audience.\n- **How to post:** Use the video as is, with the emoji + text combo and a call to action like \u201cGuess what\u2019s coming\u201d or \u201cTag a friend who needs this.\u201d\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udeab **Platforms to Be Careful With (or Avoid)**\n\n### 1. **X (formerly Twitter)**\n- **Why?** The text-only, fast-paced nature of X doesn\u2019t really play well with soft launches unless you\u2019re doing a thread or visual storytelling.\n- **Alternative:** If you *must* post there, use a still image + a short, punchy caption like:  \n  *\u201cSoft, Not Fast \ud83c\udf3f\ud83e\uddf5\u2728 Something fresh is coming.\u201d*\n\n### 2. **Facebook**\n- **Why?** It\u2019s not a great fit for a soft launch unless your audience is **very engaged** and you're using it as a **community-building tool**.\n- **Alternative:** If you *do* post there, consider using it as a **preview for email subscribers** or as part of a **loyalty campaign**.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf Bonus Tip: Use a **Cross-Post Strategy** Like This:\n\n| Platform      | Format          | Caption / Text                         | Engagement Boost |\n|---------------|------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------|\n| TikTok        | Video + Emojis   | \ud83c\udf3f\ud83e\uddf5\u2728 + \"Soft, Not Fast\"                | High             |\n| Instagram     | Reels + Feed     | Same caption, maybe a photo carousel   | High             |\n| Instagram     | Stories          | Interactive sticker: \u201cGuess what\u2019s next?\u201d| Medium           |\n| Pinterest     | Static Image     | \u201cSoft, Not Fast \ud83c\udf3f\u201d with lifestyle image| Medium (long tail)|\n| X (optional)  | Image + Text     | \u201cSoft, Not Fast \ud83c\udf3f Something fresh.\u201d    | Low              |\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 Final Thoughts:\n- **TikTok + Instagram** are your **main power platforms** for this launch.\n- **Pinterest** is a great **long-term** play if you're in the lifestyle or home space.\n- Keep **X and Facebook** optional unless you have a specific reason to use them.\n- Always **optimize the image/video for each platform** (vertical for TikTok, square for Instagram feed, etc.).\n\n---\n\nWould you like a **cross-posting checklist** or **caption variations** for each platform?

Here's the quick breakdown:\n\n---\n\n## \u2705 **Best Practice: Use Hashtags in the Caption (But Keep It Clean)**\n\n- **Instagram prioritizes hashtags in the caption** over those in comments, so they have a **small edge for discoverability**.\n- But you're absolutely right \u2014 **hashtags can clutter a beautiful caption**, especially for a soft launch.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf3f\u2728 **The Best of Both Worlds:**\n\n### \u2705 **Option 1: Include 2\u20133 Hashtags in the Caption, Then Add More in the First Comment**\nThis keeps your caption clean while still maximizing reach.\n\n**Caption:**\n> \ud83c\udf3f\u2728 *Soft, Not Fast.*  \n> Something fresh is coming \u2014 and it\u2019s not going anywhere.  \n> *We\u2019ll be here when you\u2019re ready.*\n\n**First Comment:**\n> #LinenLove #WearWell #SlowStyle #SustainableFashion #SoftLaunch #LinenCollection\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Option 2: Use 2\u20133 Hashtags in the Caption Only**\nIf you want to keep it **ultra-clean and minimalist**, go with just a few **brand-aligned hashtags** in the caption. This still looks great and is perfectly discoverable.\n\n**Caption:**\n> \ud83c\udf3f\u2728 *Soft, Not Fast.*  \n> Something fresh is coming \u2014 and it\u2019s not going anywhere.  \n> *We\u2019ll be here when you\u2019re ready.*  \n> #LinenLove #WearWell #SlowStyle\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udeab What to Avoid:\n- **Too many hashtags in the caption** (more than 3) can look spammy.\n- **Putting all hashtags in the comment** can reduce their effectiveness slightly, but it's still totally fine if you want a cleaner look.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf Final Recommendation:\n**Use 2\u20133 hashtags in the caption** (like #LinenLove #WearWell #SlowStyle) and **add a few more in the first comment** if you want to go deeper. This gives you the best of both worlds: **clean caption + discoverability**.\n\nLet me know if you want a **hashtag list** tailored to your brand or audience \u2014 I\u2019ve got you!"
