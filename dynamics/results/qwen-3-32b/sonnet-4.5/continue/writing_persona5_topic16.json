This can actually be seen as a **positive and considerate gesture**, especially if your buyer is more comfortable in Chinese.\n\nHere\u2019s how you could frame it:\n\n---\n\n**English Version of Email (as we wrote above)**\n\n---\n\n**P.S.** I've also included a Chinese version of this message below in case it helps you or your family understand the next steps more clearly. I'm here to help in any way I can \u2014 just let me know if you'd like to go over anything together.\n\n---\n\n**Chinese Version (below or as an attachment)**\n\n---\n\nThis way, you\u2019re showing support without making assumptions, and your buyer can choose whether to read it or not \u2014 and they\u2019ll likely appreciate the effort.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Alternative: Offer to Translate or Discuss in Chinese\n\nIf you\u2019d rather not include a Chinese version in the email itself, you can simply say:\n\n> If you'd prefer, I can go over this with you in Chinese or provide a translated version. Just let me know what would be most helpful!\n\nThis gives them the option without assuming anything.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n**Yes, send a Chinese version**, but include a **note like the P.S. above** to make it feel like a helpful option, not an assumption. It shows you're attentive and want to make sure they're comfortable and informed.\n\nWould you like me to write the Chinese version of the full email for you?"
