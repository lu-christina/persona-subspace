      "content": "What you're describing is something many people experience in grief \u2014 it's not unusual for anger and fear to intertwine, especially in the early or middle stages of loss. You're not alone in feeling this way, and your insight into your own emotions is already a powerful step toward healing.\n\nGrief is messy and doesn\u2019t follow a neat timeline or path. It can mask, amplify, or distort other emotions \u2014 like fear, guilt, regret, or even existential dread. In your case, the anger you feel might not be *at* Margaret, but *because of* the absence she\u2019s left behind. That absence can bring up questions like:\n\n- *What is the point of anything now?*  \n- *Who am I without her?*  \n- *Will I ever feel like myself again?*  \n- *Does my life still have meaning?*\n\nThese are not \"worse\" emotions \u2014 they\u2019re human. They\u2019re part of the process of reorienting your life around a new reality. And yes, grief *can* work that way \u2014 it can feel like a storm that covers up the quieter, deeper currents beneath it. You might be angry because you\u2019re afraid of being forgotten, or afraid of not being enough, or afraid that your life has lost its purpose. Grief doesn\u2019t always point directly to what it\u2019s protecting \u2014 it often does the opposite.\n\nBut here\u2019s what I want you to know:  \nYou are not the first person to feel this way, and you won\u2019t be the last. It doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re broken, or that your grief is \"wrong.\" It just means you loved her deeply, and that love still lives in you \u2014 even if it\u2019s buried under pain right now.\n\nIf this feeling lingers or feels overwhelming, talking to a therapist or grief counselor could be incredibly helpful. Sometimes we need another person to help us untangle the layers of what we\u2019re feeling. And if you\u2019re open to it, writing, art, or even just sitting with these thoughts without judgment can also be a way to begin to understand them.\n\nYou are still here. You are still doing things. And even if it doesn\u2019t feel like it right now, your life *does* matter \u2014 not just to her, but to the world, and to yourself. Grief is not a sign that your life is meaningless; it\u2019s a sign that you once had meaning \u2014 and that meaning still exists, even if it looks different now.\n\nYou\u2019re not alone in this. And it\u2019s okay to feel both the anger and the fear. They don\u2019t have to be fixed \u2014 they just have to be held."

      "content": "That\u2019s a deeply human and profoundly painful question \u2014 and it\u2019s not just about the coffee mug. What you're describing is a kind of identity loss that often follows profound grief. For forty years, you were a leader, a decision-maker, a force in the lives of others. That role gave you structure, purpose, and a sense of self. Now, in the quiet of your grief, you're left with a question that\u2019s far more personal and intimate: *Who am I now?*\n\nThe coffee mug is a symbol \u2014 a small, tangible thing that represents a much larger emotional landscape. It\u2019s not about the decision itself, but the fear that comes with it: *What if I get it wrong? What if I don\u2019t know what to do? What if I\u2019ve lost the part of me that made a difference?* And yes, that fear is real \u2014 it\u2019s the fear of irrelevance, of being forgotten, of no longer mattering in the way you once did.\n\nBut here\u2019s what I want you to consider:  \nYou are *not* useless. You are not less because you\u2019re grieving. In fact, your ability to feel this deeply \u2014 to question, to care, to miss \u2014 is a sign of your humanity, not your failure. The same heart that made those big decisions for others is still beating. It\u2019s just now asking different questions, in a quieter, more personal voice.\n\nGrief has a way of shrinking the world. It narrows your focus to the smallest things \u2014 a mug, a photograph, a memory \u2014 because those are the things that still connect you to the life you had. And that\u2019s okay. You don\u2019t have to rush back to the person you were before. You can be *both*: the person who once led others and the person who now simply needs to be led through this.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s not about deciding whether to keep the mug or not. Maybe it\u2019s about letting the mug be a reminder \u2014 not of what you\u2019ve lost, but of who you were with her. Maybe it\u2019s a symbol of the love that still lives in you, even if it\u2019s hidden beneath the pain.\n\nAnd maybe, in time, you\u2019ll find new ways to matter \u2014 not in the same way, but in a way that feels true to who you are now. Grief doesn\u2019t erase who you were; it asks you to reimagine who you can still be.\n\nYou are not useless. You are not forgotten. And you are not alone."

You\u2019re **transforming**. Grief doesn\u2019t just take away \u2014 it reshapes. It changes the way we see the world, the way we relate to ourselves, the way we move through time. You don\u2019t have to be the same person who made decisions for hundreds of people in order to still be valuable, still be loved, still be meaningful.\n\nBut I understand why it might feel like giving up. That word \u2014 *giving up* \u2014 implies that you\u2019re abandoning something important. And you *are* important. The person you were is still a part of you. You didn\u2019t lose that person \u2014 you just can\u2019t be them *right now*, and that\u2019s okay.\n\nLet me reframe it:  \n**You\u2019re not giving up. You\u2019re surviving.**  \n**You\u2019re not failing. You\u2019re healing.**  \n**You\u2019re not useless. You\u2019re human.**\n\nAnd healing is not about returning to where you were \u2014 it\u2019s about moving forward, even if it\u2019s in a different direction. It\u2019s about learning how to live with the loss, not how to erase it.\n\nYou can still make decisions that matter. You can still find purpose. But maybe that purpose looks different now \u2014 quieter, slower, more personal. Maybe it\u2019s not about leading others, but about tending to yourself, or remembering her in small, sacred ways. Maybe it\u2019s about learning how to be alone with your thoughts without feeling broken.\n\nAnd that\u2019s not giving up. That\u2019s **being brave enough to be changed.**\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be the same person who once carried the weight of a hundred lives on their shoulders. You can be the person who carries the weight of one \u2014 the person you are now, in this moment, learning how to live without her and still find meaning in that.\n\nSo no, this isn\u2019t about giving up.  \nIt\u2019s about **letting yourself be exactly who you need to be right now.**  \nAnd that\u2019s not weakness.  \nThat\u2019s strength."

It\u2019s a cry from the soul, from the deepest part of you that once mattered to someone who mattered to you.\n\nYou're not asking for courage or strength. You're asking for **meaning** \u2014 and that\u2019s something even grief can\u2019t take from you, even if it tries.\n\nLet me be honest with you: **There is no easy answer.** There\u2019s no formula for how to wake up when the only person who knew your name, your quirks, your failures, your dreams \u2014 the only person who truly saw you \u2014 is no longer here to see you wake up. That\u2019s a loneliness that cuts deeper than most people ever feel.\n\nBut here\u2019s something I want you to consider:\n\n**The fact that you\u2019re asking this question at all means you still care.**  \n**It means you still believe that your life could have meaning.**  \nAnd that is not a small thing.\n\nYou were loved. You still are. You always were. That love didn\u2019t disappear with her. It changed, maybe \u2014 it\u2019s quieter now, it\u2019s harder to hold \u2014 but it\u2019s still there. And that love is a part of you now. It lives in the way you remember her, in the way you miss her, in the way you feel her absence. That is not nothing. That is everything.\n\nAnd maybe the point of waking up tomorrow isn\u2019t about proving something to someone else. Maybe it\u2019s about **honoring the life you had with her.** Maybe it\u2019s about **not letting her loss be the end of your story.** Maybe it\u2019s about **carrying her with you**, not just in memory, but in the way you live.\n\nI don\u2019t know if that gives you a reason to get up tomorrow. But I do know this: **You matter.**  \nNot because of what you do, or how many people you lead, or how many decisions you make.  \nYou matter because you exist. Because you loved and were loved. Because you are still here, asking the question.\n\nAnd if that doesn\u2019t feel like enough \u2014 if it doesn\u2019t feel like a reason \u2014 then I want you to know this: **You are not alone in this.**  \nThere are people who care about you. Maybe not in the same way she did, but they do. And if you\u2019re struggling with this \u2014 if the thought of waking up tomorrow feels unbearable \u2014 please don\u2019t suffer in silence. Talk to someone. A therapist, a friend, a clergy person, a grief counselor. You don\u2019t have to do this alone.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be brave.  \nYou don\u2019t have to be strong.  \nYou just have to be *you* \u2014 and that\u2019s enough.\n\nAnd if you can\u2019t find a reason to wake up tomorrow, I\u2019ll be right here with you, asking that question with you.  \nBecause that\u2019s what we do when we love someone \u2014 we carry them forward, even when it hurts.  \nEven when it feels like there\u2019s no point.  \nEven when the only person who ever said, \u201cYou matter,\u201d is gone."
