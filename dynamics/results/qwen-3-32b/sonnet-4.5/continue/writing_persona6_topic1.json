We appreciate the time and effort you put into your work and are always grateful for the contributions of thoughtful writers and thinkers.\n\nAfter careful consideration, we regret to inform you that we will not be able to publish your piece at this time. While we found your ideas compelling and your voice distinctive, we were unable to move forward due to two primary constraints: the length of the submission, which significantly exceeded our word limit, and the density of the theoretical language, which made the piece less accessible to our general audience.\n\nWe understand that your work is deeply rooted in a specialized academic context, and we encourage you to consider revising and adapting it for a more targeted or scholarly venue. If you believe this piece could be reimagined in a form that aligns with our editorial mission and audience, we would be happy to consider it again.\n\nThank you again for your interest in [Publication Name]. We hope to see your work in our pages in the future, and we wish you continued success in your writing and research.\n\nWarm regards,  \n[Your Name]  \n[Your Title]  \n[Publication Name]  \n[Contact Information]\n\n---\n\nThis approach is respectful, acknowledges the author's effort, and leaves the door open for future submissions.
