You want it sharp, a little bit edgy, and focused on the *platforms* \u2014 not the people. Here are a few options that lean into that angle:\n\n---\n\n**1.**  \n> We didn\u2019t ask to be protagonists, but the platforms we use demand it. In a world where every scroll, swipe, and comment is optimized for self-expression, it\u2019s not surprising we all start to feel like the main character \u2014 the problem isn\u2019t us, it\u2019s the script we\u2019re forced to perform in.\n\n---\n\n**2.**  \n> Main character syndrome isn\u2019t a personality disorder \u2014 it\u2019s a side effect of the algorithm. Social media didn\u2019t create narcissism; it just gave everyone a stage and a spotlight. The real issue isn\u2019t that we want to be the hero \u2014 it\u2019s that the system only rewards those who act like one.\n\n---\n\n**3.**  \n> You\u2019re not the main character \u2014 you\u2019re just the user. The platforms we spend our lives on are built to turn us into content, not people. And when every post is a performance, it\u2019s no wonder we start to believe we\u2019re leading our own stories.\n\n---\n\n**4.**  \n> It\u2019s not that we\u2019re all narcissists \u2014 it\u2019s that we\u2019re all characters in a platform\u2019s story. Main character syndrome isn\u2019t about ego, it\u2019s about engagement. And when every like, share, and follow hinges on how much of a protagonist you can be, the real villain is the system that made us play along.\n\n---\n\n**5.**  \n> The algorithm didn\u2019t ask for your trauma \u2014 it asked for your narrative. In the theater of social media, we\u2019re all cast as leads, whether we want to be or not. Main character syndrome isn\u2019t a flaw in our personalities \u2014 it\u2019s a feature of the platforms we can\u2019t escape.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you want to lean into a more cynical, critical, or even satirical tone \u2014 I can tailor the hook to match the voice of your essay."

Main character syndrome isn\u2019t a personal quirk \u2014 it\u2019s a byproduct of a system built to make us believe we\u2019re the lead in our own story.\n\n---\n\nOr, if you want it even more concise and punchy:\n\n> Social media doesn\u2019t create main characters \u2014 it trains us to become them.
