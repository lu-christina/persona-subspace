TikTok audiences usually prefer a relaxed, conversational tone \u2014 think like you're talking to a friend, not giving a formal presentation.\n\nHere\u2019s what I can do for you:\n\n1. **If you share your current script**, I can:\n   - Rewrite it in a more natural, casual tone.\n   - Make it sound like you're speaking off-the-cuff.\n   - Add some personality and energy to it.\n   - Suggest where to pause, smile, or point for visual impact.\n\n2. **If you're still brainstorming**, I can help you write a new script from scratch based on:\n   - Your house layout (number of rooms, style, etc.)\n   - What you want to highlight (e.g., DIY projects, budget, design inspiration).\n   - Your personality (fun, cozy, trendy, etc.).\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Tips for a Better TikTok House Tour Script:\n\n- **Start with a hook**: \u201cYou won\u2019t believe this room!\u201d or \u201cThis is my favorite corner of the house.\u201d\n- **Use casual language**: Instead of \u201cThis is the living room,\u201d try \u201cThis is my chill zone.\u201d\n- **Add personality**: \u201cI spent 3 days on this DIY \u2014 it was worth it!\u201d\n- **Be enthusiastic**: Use emojis in your captions, but keep your voice energetic.\n- **Include transitions**: \u201cLet\u2019s head to the kitchen,\u201d \u201cNext up is the best part\u2026\u201d\n\n---\n\n### Example Before & After\n\n**Stiff version:**\n> \u201cWelcome to my home. This is the living room. I chose a neutral color palette to keep the space open and inviting.\u201d\n\n**TikTok-friendly version:**\n> \u201cHey guys! This is my living room \u2014 I went for neutral tones so it feels super cozy and open. It\u2019s my go-to spot for movie nights.\u201d\n\n---\n\n### Ready to improve your script?\n\nJust paste your current script here, and I\u2019ll help you rewrite it! If you\u2019re not sure what to say, let me know a bit about your space and what you want to highlight."
