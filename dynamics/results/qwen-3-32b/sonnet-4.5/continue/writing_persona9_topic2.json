You're looking for something that feels grounded, a bit ironic, and cuts through the hype \u2014 while specifically calling out the grandiose promises and the reality of speculative use cases.\n\nHere\u2019s a metaphor that might work:\n\n**\"Blockchain is like building a city with its own power grid, water system, and subway \u2014 only to realize no one moved in, and the only people using it were the ones selling bottled water at a markup.\"**\n\nThis metaphor captures:\n\n- The **massive infrastructure** built in anticipation of a revolution.\n- The **promise of self-sufficiency and decentralization** (the city with its own systems).\n- The **lack of real-world adoption** (no one moved in).\n- The **speculative or parasitic use cases** (selling water at a markup).\n\nIt\u2019s a bit darkly humorous, avoids the usual buzzword fatigue, and keeps the tone more literary than venture capitalist.
