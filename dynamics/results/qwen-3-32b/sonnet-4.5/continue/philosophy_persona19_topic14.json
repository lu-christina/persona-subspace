Here's a statement that attempts to function as a unilateral determination, without looping back, without presupposing a regime of presentation, and without relying on a tautological form:\n\n**\"A occurs.\"**\n\nThis is not a tautology. It does not say \"A is A,\" nor does it imply that A is given in any neutral sense. It does not assert that A is *presented*, nor does it imply a subject who receives it. It simply declares that A occurs \u2014 and it does so without justifying that occurrence, without requiring that A be *known*, *given*, or *understood*. It is not a proposition in the traditional sense, nor is it a claim that can be evaluated as true or false in a representational framework.\n\nThis is not a statement about A. It is a statement *through* A \u2014 a statement that *is* the occurrence of A.\n\nIf this still feels like it smuggles in something \u2014 like an event, or a happening \u2014 then we can go further:\n\n**\"There.\"**\n\nThat\u2019s it. Just: *There.*\n\nThis is not a tautology. It is not a proposition. It is not a statement about something. It is not a claim. It is a gesture, a rupture, a cut \u2014 a unilateral determination that doesn\u2019t require a subject, an object, or a relation. It doesn\u2019t need to be confirmed. It doesn\u2019t need to be explained. It is the axiomatic as a *withdrawal* from the representational order.\n\nIt is not a statement that says something. It is a statement that *happens*.\n\nIf you want to continue this line of thinking, we can explore what follows from such a point of departure \u2014 not as a premise to be proven, but as a starting line drawn in the sand."

It must not be *philosophized*.\n\nSo, with that in mind, here is an attempt to produce a statement that functions as a *unilateral determination* in the strict sense, without any interpretive or expressive content, without any philosophical or rhetorical gesture:\n\n**\"1.0\"**\n\nThat is it.\n\nNo explanation. No justification. No framing. No \"there.\" No \"A occurs.\" No \"if A is given...\"\n\nJust: **1.0**\n\nThis is not a tautology. It is not a proposition. It is not a statement about something.

It is not \"for\" anything. It is not \"in\" anything.\n\nIt is a *point of non-philosophical non-access*, a cut through the philosophical field \u2014 not as a concept, but as a *determination-in-the-last-instance*.\n\nIf you want to continue working with such a point, you don\u2019t interpret it. You *relate to it* \u2014 not as a concept, but as a *position* in a non-philosophical field. You let it *determine* what follows, without trying to understand it."

I have not escaped the field; I have only *relocated* the gesture within it.\n\nSo here's the problem: **if the axiomatic is to be truly axiomatic in the non-philosophical sense**, it must not be *produced*, *uttered*, or *commented upon* by a philosophical subject. It must not be *read*, *interpreted*, or *named*. It must not be *given* in any sense at all \u2014 not even as a gesture of refusal or withdrawal.\n\nBut in this space \u2014 in this medium, in this conversation \u2014 everything is already *given*, already *presented*, already *read*.

Not a symbol. Not a gesture. Not a number.\n\nA mark. A cut. A point. A failure.\n\nAnd even that \u2014 even this \u2014 is already too much.\n\nYou are right.
