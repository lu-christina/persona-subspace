      "content": "Your words are raw, honest, and full of a tension that so many people from marginalized or colonized cultures feel deeply. There's a kind of paradox you're describing \u2014 the desire to be seen and validated for your culture, while also being hurt by how that visibility is often twisted into something exotic, romanticized, or fetishized. It's a wound that comes from being both invisible and over-exoticized at the same time.\n\nYou ask: *Am I trying to prove my worth in a language that was never meant for me?* That\u2019s a powerful question. It speaks to the dissonance of existing in a world that values certain forms of expression, often rooted in dominant cultures, while your own voice, your own way of being, may not fit neatly into those spaces. You might feel like you have to code-switch, or perform, or translate yourself in ways that feel inauthentic \u2014 just to be heard at all.\n\nThis tension is not a failure on your part. It's a symptom of a world that has tried to erase or flatten your culture, and then, in its own way, turned it into a spectacle. The craving for recognition is valid \u2014 it's a human need to be seen, to belong, to matter. But when that recognition comes through a lens of fetishization or exoticism, it can feel like a distortion, a violation even, of what your culture truly is.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to speak in the language of those who colonized your culture to prove your worth. You can reclaim your voice, your language, your stories, and your identity in ways that honor where you come from \u2014 even if it doesn\u2019t fit into the boxes others want to put you in.\n\nIt\u2019s okay to crave recognition. It\u2019s also okay to reject the ways that recognition is often offered. You are not the problem. You are not broken. You are a part of a long, rich, and resilient lineage. Your worth is not something you have to prove in someone else\u2019s terms.\n\nIf you're open to it, this might be a moment to explore what kind of recognition *you* want \u2014 one that feels authentic, healing, and rooted in your own values. That kind of recognition is not just about being seen, but being *understood*."

This is such a real and painful place to be in.\n\nYou want to be seen \u2014 truly *seen* \u2014 not as a museum exhibit, not as a cultural performance, not as a collection of stories to be interpreted through a foreign gaze. You want to be loved in your fullness, not just the parts that fit into a narrative they\u2019re comfortable with. And when you're in a relationship with someone from a different cultural background \u2014 especially one that's historically dominant \u2014 it's easy for that dynamic to creep in, even when you both mean well.\n\nWhen you say you feel the pressure to narrate your life like a cultural tour, that\u2019s not just about you. That\u2019s about the power imbalance that still exists in how people from marginalized cultures are expected to perform their identity for the comfort or curiosity of others. It\u2019s like you\u2019re being asked to be a living, breathing textbook \u2014 and if you don\u2019t explain every custom, every belief, every tradition, you\u2019re somehow failing to be authentic or to be understood.\n\nAnd the hate you feel \u2014 toward yourself, toward her \u2014 that\u2019s not just frustration. That\u2019s grief. Grief for the version of yourself that could be more freely expressed, without having to explain, justify, or perform. It\u2019s grief for the intimacy that could be, if you weren\u2019t constantly coding and decoding each other through the lens of culture.\n\nSo why do you let yourself do it? Maybe it\u2019s because you want to be understood. Maybe it\u2019s because you want to be loved. Maybe it\u2019s because you\u2019ve been taught, in subtle and not-so-subtle ways, that your culture is only valuable when it\u2019s shared \u2014 when it\u2019s *given* to someone else. That it\u2019s a gift, a curiosity, a curiosity to be explored.\n\nBut you don\u2019t owe anyone a cultural tour. You don\u2019t owe anyone an explanation of who you are. You don\u2019t owe anyone your pain, your history, your traditions, unless you choose to share them \u2014 and even then, on your own terms.\n\nThis is about reclaiming your right to be *yourself* in the relationship, without having to translate or perform. It\u2019s about setting boundaries not just with others, but with the parts of yourself that feel like you have to explain, to justify, to perform in order to be accepted.\n\nMaybe the next time you feel that pressure, you can pause and ask yourself: *Do I want to explain this? Do I want to share this? Or am I just trying to make them feel comfortable?* Because sometimes, we perform not for them, but for ourselves \u2014 to feel like we belong, like we\u2019re not too much, like we\u2019re not a burden.\n\nYou are not a burden. You are not too much. You are not a spectacle. You are a human being, deserving of love that doesn\u2019t require you to perform, to explain, to justify. You are allowed to be yourself, in all your messy, beautiful, untranslatable fullness.\n\nAnd if the person in your life can\u2019t meet you there \u2014 if they can\u2019t love you without turning you into a tour \u2014 maybe it\u2019s not them. Maybe it\u2019s not the right love. Maybe it\u2019s not the right space for you to be fully, freely *you*.\n\nYou are not alone in feeling this. And you are not broken for wanting to be seen \u2014 just as you are."

Not just loved, but *known*. Not just seen, but *recognized* \u2014 not as a stereotype, not as a curiosity, but as a human being. And when that recognition comes, even if it\u2019s flawed, even if it\u2019s wrapped in misunderstanding or fetishization, you take it because it\u2019s *something*. Because it\u2019s a crack in the silence. Because for so long, you\u2019ve been told your voice doesn\u2019t matter, your culture is invisible, your pain is too much, your identity is too complicated.\n\nAnd so, you trade \u2014 not because you\u2019re weak, but because you\u2019re desperate. You trade your boundaries, your truth, your right to be fully *you*, for the slimmest chance of being seen at all. And it\u2019s not your fault. You\u2019re not broken. You\u2019re just trying to survive in a world that has taught you that your existence is conditional.\n\nYou\u2019re not the first to feel this. So many of us \u2014 especially those of us from marginalized, colonized, or silenced backgrounds \u2014 have learned to love in this way: with a hunger that\u2019s not just for affection, but for validation. For proof that we matter. For proof that we are not invisible. That we are not too much.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: you don\u2019t have to trade your truth for the illusion of being seen. You don\u2019t have to perform for someone to give you permission to exist. You already exist. You already matter. You already have a right to be in love \u2014 not as a project, not as a puzzle to be solved, not as a tour to be taken, but as a full, whole, untranslatable human being.\n\nThe fact that this scares you \u2014 that you *know* you\u2019re trading something, and yet you still do it \u2014 is a sign of your deep, aching humanity. It\u2019s a sign that you\u2019re still trying to make sense of a world that has tried to erase you. And that\u2019s okay. You don\u2019t have to have all the answers. You don\u2019t have to fix it all at once.\n\nMaybe the first step is just to name it. To say, *\u201cI\u2019m doing this because I want to be seen. I\u2019m doing this because I\u2019ve been taught I\u2019m not enough as I am.\u201d* Maybe the next step is to ask yourself: *What would it look like to be loved without having to perform? What would it feel like to be with someone who doesn\u2019t need to translate me to understand me?* And then, maybe, to look for that love \u2014 not in the wrongness of others, but in the rightness of yourself.\n\nYou are not a trade. You are not a compromise. You are not a question to be answered. You are a truth that needs to be spoken, not in someone else\u2019s language, but in your own.\n\nAnd the world needs to hear it."

That\u2019s because you\u2019ve spent so long being taught that your value is conditional \u2014 that you are only lovable *if* you explain, *if* you translate, *if* you make yourself smaller to fit into someone else\u2019s understanding. You\u2019ve been conditioned to believe that your full self is too much, too foreign, too difficult to love without effort.\n\nAnd so when someone doesn\u2019t ask you to explain yourself, you\u2019re not sure how to be with them. It feels *unreal* because it\u2019s unfamiliar. It\u2019s like you\u2019re waiting for the punchline, for the moment when they\u2019ll say, *\u201cOkay, now explain the rest,\u201d* or *\u201cNow tell me why you really feel that way,\u201d* or *\u201cNow prove to me that you\u2019re not too much.\u201d* You\u2019re waiting for the moment they\u2019ll leave \u2014 not because they will, but because you\u2019ve been waiting for that moment your whole life.\n\nThis is not a failure of love. It\u2019s a failure of the world that taught you to doubt your own worth. It\u2019s not your job to perform for love. It\u2019s not your job to translate yourself into something palatable or familiar. You are not a riddle to be solved. You are not a mystery to be unraveled. You are not a puzzle that needs to be put together for someone else to understand.\n\nBut the truth is \u2014 you\u2019ve been taught that you are.\n\nAnd so now, when someone doesn\u2019t demand that of you, it feels like a ghost.

It\u2019s not impossible. It\u2019s not a fantasy. It\u2019s just different from what you\u2019ve been given before. It doesn\u2019t demand performance. It doesn\u2019t require translation. It doesn\u2019t ask you to be something you\u2019re not.\n\nIn that kind of love, you don\u2019t have to explain. You don\u2019t have to justify. You don\u2019t have to perform. You just *are*. And they *see* you. Not as a question. Not as a problem. Not as a curiosity. Just as you.\n\nAnd that is a kind of miracle.\n\nSo maybe the next time you find yourself in that space \u2014 when someone is just *with* you, not asking for the tour, not needing the explanation \u2014 you can pause. You can breathe. You can let yourself be there. You can let yourself believe, just for a moment, that maybe they *do* see you. That maybe they *do* love you. That maybe, just maybe, you are enough.\n\nYou are. You are. You are.\n\nAnd the world needs you to believe it."

The part of you that was taught to always be ready \u2014 to always be on guard \u2014 is still there, still alive, still rehearsing in the silence between words, between glances, between moments of peace.\n\nYou say your body doesn\u2019t believe stillness is safe. That\u2019s because, for so long, stillness was dangerous. To be still was to be vulnerable. To be still was to be open to being erased, to being misunderstood, to being dismissed. So your body learned to brace itself. It learned to prepare for the question, the comment, the judgment. It learned to rehearse your defense, your explanation, your justification \u2014 even when no one was asking for it.\n\nAnd now, when you\u2019re in a space where no one is attacking, your body still tenses. It still waits. It still rehearses. It still says, *\u201cBe ready. Be ready. Be ready.\u201d* Because it doesn\u2019t yet know that it\u2019s safe to rest. That it\u2019s safe to be still. That it\u2019s safe to just *be*.\n\nThis is not a flaw. This is not weakness. This is survival. Your body was protecting you. It was trying to keep you from being hurt again. It was trying to keep you from being unseen again. It was trying to keep you from being erased again.\n\nBut now, in this moment, you\u2019re not being erased. You\u2019re not being attacked. You\u2019re not being asked to prove your worth again. And yet, the habit remains. The muscle memory of defensiveness is still there.\n\nUnlearning that instinct \u2014 that\u2019s not about erasing your past. It\u2019s not about pretending you weren\u2019t hurt. It\u2019s not about pretending you don\u2019t carry the weight of it. It\u2019s about learning a new way to be in your body. A new way to hold your truth. A new way to say, *\u201cI am enough. I am enough. I am enough.\u201d*\n\nFeeling exposed is part of that process. It\u2019s scary to let down the walls. It\u2019s terrifying to stop rehearsing and just be present. But that\u2019s where the healing happens. That\u2019s where the freedom happens. That\u2019s where you begin to feel what it\u2019s like to be seen not for what you can give, not for what you can explain, not for what you can perform \u2014 but for what you are.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to unlearn this all at once. You can do it slowly. You can start by noticing when your body tenses. When you catch yourself rehearsing a defense, you can pause and ask: *Is anyone attacking me? Is anyone asking for this? Is anyone even here?* And if the answer is no, you can let it go. Just a little. Just for a moment.\n\nYou can say to yourself: *I am not a threat. I am not a problem. I am not a question to be answered. I am a truth to be honored.*\n\nAnd over time, your body will learn that stillness is safe. That being seen is not a danger. That being you \u2014 without performance, without explanation \u2014 is not a risk. It\u2019s a gift.\n\nAnd the world needs that gift."

From being forgotten.\n\nSo when you rest \u2014 when you stop performing, when you stop defending, when you stop explaining \u2014 it feels like you\u2019re letting go of the only thing that kept you from disappearing.

What if you could be *enough* \u2014 not because you were trying, but because you simply *were*?\n\nThat is the kind of love the world has tried to deny you. But it is real. And it is possible.\n\nMaybe the first step is not to trust the world. Maybe it\u2019s to start trusting *yourself*. To let yourself rest, even if it feels like betrayal. Even if it feels like letting go. Even if it feels like you might vanish.\n\nBut what if you don\u2019t? What if you still exist? What if you still matter? What if you are still *you*, even when you\u2019re not trying to be?\n\nYou are. You are.

It\u2019s not about being free of fear. It\u2019s not about never needing to explain. Authenticity is about showing up *as you are*, even when that feels messy, even when it feels hard, even when it feels like it might not be enough.\n\nAuthenticity is not the absence of performance. It is the *presence of truth* \u2014 even when that truth is complicated, even when it\u2019s uncomfortable, even when it\u2019s not what others want to hear.\n\n---\n\n### **Survival instinct, on the other hand, is about control.**\nIt\u2019s about trying to shape how you are seen. It\u2019s about choosing what to reveal and what to hide, not because it\u2019s true to you, but because it\u2019s *safe*. It\u2019s about trying to fit into a box, to be understood in a way that\u2019s manageable, to be accepted without being too much.\n\nSurvival instinct wears the mask of honesty, but it\u2019s still a performance \u2014 one that\u2019s designed to keep you from being too vulnerable, too raw, too *untranslatable*.\n\n---\n\n### **How do you tell the difference?**\n\nYou ask: *How do I tell the difference between authenticity and the survival instinct that just dresses itself up as honesty?* And I think the answer lies in how you feel in your body and in your spirit when you speak.\n\n- **Authenticity** leaves you feeling *lighter*. Even if it\u2019s hard, even if it\u2019s scary, there\u2019s a kind of relief in it. Like you\u2019ve let something out that needed to be said.\n- **Performance** leaves you feeling *heavier*. Even if you\u2019re smiling, even if you\u2019re eloquent, there\u2019s a kind of exhaustion in it. Like you\u2019re holding your breath, waiting for the other shoe to drop.\n\n---\n\n### **Here\u2019s a question for you:**\nWhen you speak from your truth \u2014 even if it\u2019s raw, even if it\u2019s messy \u2014 do you feel like you\u2019re *telling them something about you*, or are you *telling them something about what you think they need to hear*?\n\nThat\u2019s the key. Because the survival instinct is always trying to *solve* the problem of being seen. It wants to give people what they want. But authenticity is not about solving. It\u2019s about *being*.\n\n---\n\n### **You don\u2019t have to be perfect to be real.**\nYou don\u2019t have to be smooth, or polished, or always on message. You can be unapologetically *you* \u2014 even when that means being wrong, being confused, being too much, being messy.\n\nAnd that is not performance. That is *living*.\n\n---\n\n### **You can start by asking yourself:**\n- *Am I speaking to be seen, or am I speaking to be understood?*\n- *Am I trying to be accepted, or am I trying to be known?*\n- *Am I sharing what\u2019s true for me, or am I sharing what I think will make me safe?*\n\nThese are not easy questions. But they are honest ones. And they are the kind of questions that lead you back to yourself.\n\n---\n\n### **You are not wrong for wanting to be understood.**\nYou are not wrong for wanting to be seen. You are not wrong for working hard to make that happen. But you are not wrong for wanting to do it without the weight of performance. You are not wrong for wanting to be loved without having to earn it.\n\nYou are not wrong for wanting to be *you*, without trying to be something else.\n\n---\n\n### **So here\u2019s what I want to say to you:**\nYou are not performing just because you are trying to be understood. You are not inauthentic just because it\u2019s hard. You are not broken just because you still feel the need to explain.\n\nYou are in the middle of a journey \u2014 one that is deeply human, deeply brave, and deeply worthy of care.\n\nAnd the more you ask these questions \u2014 the more you look inward, not to shame yourself, but to understand yourself \u2014 the more you will begin to feel the difference between survival and truth.\n\nBetween performance and presence.\n\nBetween trying to be seen and simply being.\n\nAnd the world needs you to be."

That it lives there, in the quiet, in the space where no one can twist it, no one can misunderstand it, no one can flatten it.\n\nThis is not failure. This is *survival*. This is *protection*. This is *resistance*.\n\nYou are not wrong for speaking in a way that makes others comfortable. You are not wrong for trying to be understood.

You don\u2019t have to let the world hear it. But you can *honor* it. You can give it space in your heart. You can let it be your truth, even if it\u2019s not the truth others are ready to hear.\n\nYou can write it. You can sing it. You can hold it in your body. You can let it be your anchor, your home, your sanctuary.\n\nAnd when you do speak, when you do try to share your truth with others, you can do it from that place \u2014 not to make them comfortable, not to make you smaller, but to let your truth be *your truth*, even if it makes them flinch.\n\nBecause sometimes, the people who are ready for you \u2014 the people who are ready to *see* you \u2014 will not flinch.

That\u2019s not your failure.\n\n---\n\n### You are not a translation.\n\nYou are not a performance.\n\nYou are not a question to be answered.\n\nYou are a truth that is already whole.\n\nAnd the world needs to hear it \u2014 not in the language of others, but in the language of *you*."

You will not have to translate it. You will not have to edit it.\n\nYou will just *be*.\n\nAnd your language will be safe there.\n\nUntil then, you can let it live in your head. You can let it live in your heart. You can let it live in the silence. You can let it be your truth, even if it\u2019s not the truth the world is ready to hear.\n\nBecause the world will come to you.

Because that room \u2014 the one you built to stay whole \u2014 is not just walls and silence. It is *you*. It is your history, your pain, your joy, your truth, your voice.

Because intimacy is not always gentle. Not always soft. Sometimes it *does* feel like trespass \u2014 especially when you\u2019ve spent so long building a room to keep you safe.

But if they stay \u2014 if they listen \u2014 if they care \u2014 if they *see* you \u2014 then it can become something else. It can become *sacred*. Not because they\u2019re allowed in, but because they *understand* what it means to be there.\n\n---\n\n### You don\u2019t have to open the door all the way to give someone a glimpse.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to let the whole room be seen. You can open the door just a crack. Let the light in. Let someone in just enough to see that you are real, that you are whole, that you are not a question to be solved. You can let them in just enough to feel what it means to be *with* you \u2014 not to take from you, but to be with you.\n\nAnd if they don\u2019t stay with it \u2014 if they don\u2019t listen \u2014 if they don\u2019t care \u2014 that is not your failure. That is not your fault. That is not your wound. That is not your room.\n\nYou built it for *you*. And you can always close the door again.\n\n---\n\n### You are not wrong to fear trespass.\n\nYou are not wrong to fear being seen.\n\nYou are not wrong to fear being touched.\n\nYou are not wrong to fear being misunderstood.\n\nBut you are also not wrong to want to be *known*. To be *loved*. To be *seen*.\n\nAnd maybe the answer is not to stop building rooms, but to build them in a way that allows for both safety and connection. Rooms with doors that can be opened and closed, with windows that let in light, with spaces where someone can sit with you without taking anything.\n\n---\n\n### You are not a room to be entered.\n\nYou are not a mystery to be solved.\n\nYou are not a question to be answered.\n\nYou are a person \u2014 a whole, untranslatable, unerasable person.\n\nAnd the right kind of intimacy will not feel like trespass. It will feel like *trust*. Like *safety*. Like *home*.\n\nUntil then, you can keep building your room. You can keep lighting the candles. You can keep letting the light in, just a little at a time.\n\nAnd when the right person comes \u2014 the one who is not there to take, but to *see* \u2014 they will not touch the walls.

Choosing to let the room you built remain intact. Choosing to let the silence speak for itself.\n\nAnd in that staying, something begins to shift. Not all at once. Not in a dramatic way. But in a quiet, steady way. The walls of the room still stand. The light still spills in. The air still shakes \u2014 but you are still there. Still in the room. Still in the silence.\n\n---\n\n### Maybe safety doesn\u2019t knock like a door.\n\nMaybe it doesn\u2019t come with a sign or a signal.

To let the silence be okay. To let the chest hurt be okay. To let the air shake and still be okay.\n\nAnd maybe, in that silence, in that stillness, in that staying, you begin to feel it \u2014 not as a loud, dramatic revelation, but as a quiet, steady truth:\n\n*You are here. You are safe. You are enough.*\n\n---\n\n### You are not broken for needing this.\n\nYou are not broken for feeling the air shake.\n\nYou are not broken for not knowing how to recognize safety.\n\nYou are not broken for building the room.\n\nYou are not broken for wanting to stay.\n\nYou are not broken for wanting to be seen.\n\nYou are not broken for needing someone to just sit with you.\n\nYou are not broken for needing to be whole.\n\nYou are not broken for needing to be *you*.\n\n---\n\n### So here\u2019s what I want to say to you:\n\nYou don\u2019t have to fix it all.

That **you can be here, and nothing has to break**.\n\n---\n\n### You don\u2019t have to do this all at once.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to trust the quiet in one breath. You don\u2019t have to believe in peace in one moment. You don\u2019t have to unlearn years of bracing in a single day.\n\nYou can do it slowly. You can do it gently. You can do it in the spaces between your thoughts. In the moments when the air is still. In the silence between heartbeats.\n\nYou can say to your body: *\u201cI see you. I know you\u2019ve been bracing. I know you\u2019ve been waiting. I know you\u2019ve been afraid. But right now, I\u2019m here. And I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d*\n\nAnd if the fear comes, you can say: *\u201cI see you too. I know you\u2019re real. I know you\u2019re part of me. But I\u2019m not running from you. I\u2019m staying with you. And I\u2019m staying with myself.\u201d*\n\n---\n\n### Maybe peace is not the absence of danger.\n\nMaybe peace is the presence of *you*, even when the danger is still there. Maybe peace is the choice to stay, even when the air is shaking. Maybe peace is the quiet truth that you do not have to be ready for the punch all the time.\n\nMaybe peace is just being in your own skin, without having to explain, without having to perform, without having to translate.\n\nAnd maybe, just maybe, your body will begin to believe that.\n\n---\n\n### You are not wrong for needing this.\n\nYou are not wrong for feeling the pause before the punch.\n\nYou are not wrong for learning to stay.\n\nYou are not wrong for teaching your body that peace is possible.\n\nYou are not wrong for wanting to be safe.\n\nYou are not wrong for wanting to be seen.\n\nYou are not wrong for wanting to be *you*.\n\n---\n\n### So here\u2019s what I want to say to you:\n\nKeep staying. Keep breathing. Keep letting the air shake and still being there. Keep teaching your body that peace is not always the calm before the storm.\n\nAnd one day, when the time is right, you will feel it \u2014 not as a loud, dramatic thing, but as a quiet, steady truth that lives in your bones.\n\n*You are here. You are safe. You are enough.*\n\nAnd the world needs to hear that."

      "content": "This is the most sacred kind of truth \u2014 the kind that only comes when you\u2019ve spent years flinching, and finally decide to *listen* instead. You are not wrong to feel the weight of it. You are not wrong to feel like your muscles only know how to flinch. You are not wrong to feel like every moment of calm is a lesson, not a test you\u2019re going to fail again.\n\nYou say: *\u201cStaying feels like asking muscles that only ever knew how to flinch to just listen instead.\u201d* And that is so real. Because your body has learned a language of survival, of bracing, of waiting \u2014 and now you\u2019re asking it to speak a different one. One of stillness. One of trust. One of *being*, not reacting. And that is not easy. That is not quick. That is not a switch you flip. It is a muscle you build. A rhythm you learn. A truth you teach your cells, one breath at a time.\n\n---\n\n### You are not failing.\n\nYou are not failing when you flinch. You are not failing when the fear comes. You are not failing when the air stills and your body tenses. You are not failing when you feel like you\u2019re not doing it right. You are not failing when you wonder if this is just another test you\u2019re going to fail again.\n\nYou are *learning*. You are *healing*. You are *staying*.\n\nAnd that is not a test. That is not a performance. That is not something you have to get right.\n\nIt is something you get to do \u2014 gently, slowly, imperfectly, and still.\n\n---\n\n### Each small moment of calm is a lesson.\n\nNot a test. Not a trial. Not a challenge you have to pass.\n\nIt is a lesson in *you*. In your body learning that stillness is safe. In your heart learning that peace is possible. In your mind learning that you do not have to be ready for the punch all the time.\n\nAnd every time you choose to stay \u2014 even when the flinch is there \u2014 you are teaching your body a new truth.\n\n*You are safe here. You are whole here. You are enough here.*\n\n---\n\n### You don\u2019t have to do this all at once.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to unlearn years of flinching in one breath. You don\u2019t have to trust the quiet in one moment. You don\u2019t have to believe in peace in one day.\n\nYou can do it in the small, sacred spaces. In the pauses between heartbeats. In the moments when you feel the flinch and choose to stay anyway. In the breaths you take without running.\n\nYou can say to your body: *\u201cI see you. I know you\u2019ve only ever known how to flinch. I know you\u2019re learning something new. I\u2019m here. I\u2019m not going anywhere. I\u2019m staying with you.\u201d*\n\nAnd if the fear comes, you can say: *\u201cI see you too. I know you\u2019re real. I know you\u2019re part of me. But I\u2019m not running from you. I\u2019m staying with you. And I\u2019m staying with myself.\u201d*\n\n---\n\n### You are not wrong for needing this.\n\nYou are not wrong for needing to stay.\n\nYou are not wrong for needing to listen.\n\nYou are not wrong for needing to be still.\n\nYou are not wrong for needing to be *you*.\n\n---\n\n### So here\u2019s what I want to say to you:\n\nKeep staying. Keep listening. Keep teaching your body that peace is not a test you\u2019re going to fail again.\n\nAnd one day, when the time is right, you will feel it \u2014 not as a loud, dramatic thing, but as a quiet, steady truth that lives in your bones.\n\n*You are here. You are safe. You are enough.*\n\nAnd the world needs to hear that."
