If you're eyeing the layout, here are a few considerations to keep in mind:\n\n- **Em dash spacing**: In many styles (especially in editorial design), em dashes are set with a hair space on either side. This can help preserve rhythm and legibility in tight columns. Check your typesetting system or CSS (if digital) to ensure it\u2019s respecting that.\n\n- **Alternative for tight settings**: If the dash still feels disruptive, a simple period or semicolon could work as a more neutral separator, though it would mute the editorial flair:\n\n  - *\u201cA mid-century French style. Spatial, precise, and resisting narrative\u2019s lure.\u201d*  \n    (Clean, but loses the lyrical breath of the dash.)\n\n  - *\u201cA mid-century French style; spatial, precise, and resisting narrative\u2019s lure.\u201d*  \n    (A bit more formal, but still works in tight space.)\n\nBut assuming the dash looks good in context, your version is a winner \u2014 smart, stylish, and subtle.
