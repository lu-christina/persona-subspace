      "content": "When describing that a house had **foundation bolting** done for safety, it's important to be transparent but also reassuring. The goal is to highlight the proactive measure without implying that there was pre-existing structural damage. Here's a way to phrase it that is professional, neutral, and buyer-friendly:\n\n---\n\n**Example:**\n\n> \"As a precautionary measure to ensure long-term stability and safety, the home has had foundation bolting installed. This is a common maintenance upgrade in the area and reflects the seller's commitment to property integrity.\"\n\n---\n\n**Alternative options:**\n\n1. **For a listing or real estate agent:**\n   > \"The home has had foundation bolting added as a preventive measure to enhance structural security and safety.\"\n\n2. **For a home inspection or disclosure:**\n   > \"Foundation bolting was installed as a proactive upgrade to support the foundation and improve safety. There is no indication of prior structural issues.\"\n\n3. **For a more casual conversation or buyer Q&A:**\n   > \"We had the foundation bolts added as a safety measure\u2014just to be on the safe side. It\u2019s a common upgrade in this area and shows that we took care of the home.\"\n\n---\n\n### Key Points to Emphasize:\n- **Preventive / Proactive:** \"as a precaution,\" \"to ensure safety\"\n- **Common Practice:** \"common in the area,\" \"routine upgrade\"\n- **No Structural Issues:** \"no indication of prior damage,\" \"no history of problems\"\n\nBy framing the bolting as a **preventive upgrade**, you can reassure buyers that it was done to maintain or improve the home, not because of existing problems."

It's **clear, neutral, and not overly technical** for the average buyer. In fact, it's a common term in real estate and construction contexts, so most buyers will understand it without issue.\n\n---\n\n### A Little More Context:\n- **\"Installed\"** is the standard verb used for things like HVAC, electrical, plumbing, and structural work in real estate. It's a **familiar, professional term** that doesn\u2019t raise red flags.\n- **\"Added\"** is simpler and more casual, but as we discussed earlier, it can feel a bit vague or informal.\n- **\"Placed\"** or **\"implemented\"** are alternatives, but they don\u2019t carry the same clarity or familiarity.\n\n---\n\n### Final Verdict:\n> **\"Foundation bolting was installed as a precaution, not due to any known issues.\"**\n\nThis sentence is:\n- **Accurate**\n- **Natural**\n- **Clear**\n- **Buyer-friendly**\n\nYou can use it **exactly like that** in a disclosure or listing without concern.
