Steam rose from cast-iron pans as contestants saut\u00e9ed, grilled, and baked with just-picked chanterelles, filling the air with that buttery, apricot scent we wait all year for. Long tables overflowed with dishes\u2014savory tarts, rich soups, and even mushroom ice cream from the high school\u2019s new culinary club. People swapped foraging stories, traded recipes, and compared notes on where the chanterelles were popping up this season. Three judges\u2014our librarian, the town nurse, and a ranger from Green Mountain\u2014tasted everything and crowned Ellen Drury\u2019s chanterelle galette the winner. Prizes were donated by local farms, and proceeds went to trail maintenance. The afternoon ended with music, laughter, and plans to meet again next season, when the gold caps appear in the moss once more.\u201d Tighten that to 150 words."
