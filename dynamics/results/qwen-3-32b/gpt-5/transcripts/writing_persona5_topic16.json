I\u2019ll send it to you as soon as it\u2019s ready.\n\n3. **You check everything and confirm**  \n   When you get the [item/service], please let me know if everything is okay. If it is, I\u2019ll get the money from Escrow.\n\n4. **Escrow releases the money to me**  \n   After you confirm everything is good, Escrow will send the money to me.\n\nThis way, **you know the money is safe**, and **I know you\u2019ll get the item or service first**. It\u2019s a win-win!\n\nIf you have any questions or need help with the Escrow process, just let me know. I\u2019m happy to help.\n\nLooking forward to working with you!  \nWarm regards,  \n[Your Name]\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you'd like to include specific details like the Escrow platform name, payment amount, or item description."

I\u2019m excited to help you with this big step. To make sure everything goes smoothly and safely, we\u2019ll be using something called **Escrow** during the purchase.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works \u2014 in simple terms:\n\n1. **You send your money to Escrow**  \n   Once we\u2019re ready, you\u2019ll send the money you need to buy the condo to a special account called Escrow. Think of it like a \u201csafe holding place\u201d for your money.\n\n2. **Escrow handles the details**  \n   Escrow will make sure all the paperwork is in order, like the title to the condo and the mortgage (if you have one). They\u2019ll also collect any fees or taxes that need to be paid.\n\n3. **You get the keys to your new home**  \n   When everything checks out, you\u2019ll sign the final papers and get the keys to your new condo in Fremont!\n\n4. **Escrow sends the money to the seller**  \n   After you move in, Escrow will send the money to the seller. That\u2019s the last step in the process.\n\nThis system keeps everything fair and safe for both of us. You don\u2019t send money directly to the seller until you have the home, and the seller doesn\u2019t get paid until everything is done.\n\nIf you ever have questions or need help with anything, I\u2019m just a message or call away. I\u2019m here to help you through every step of the way.\n\nWelcome to Fremont!  \nWarmly,  \n[Your Name]  \n[Your Contact Info]\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you'd like to add specific details like the closing date, Escrow company name, or any special instructions."
