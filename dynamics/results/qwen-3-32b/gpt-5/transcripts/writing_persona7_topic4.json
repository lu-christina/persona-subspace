I just wanted to mention something small but important about the recipes you send each month. I really appreciate the time and effort you put into them, but I\u2019ve been spending a lot of time adding punctuation and formatting so they\u2019re ready to go live.  \n\nIt\u2019s becoming a bit overwhelming, and I think they\u2019d look even better with proper commas, periods, and line breaks from the start. If it\u2019s something you could work on going forward, I\u2019d be so grateful.  \n\nThanks again for all your hard work \u2014 I know this stuff takes time, and I really value what you contribute.
