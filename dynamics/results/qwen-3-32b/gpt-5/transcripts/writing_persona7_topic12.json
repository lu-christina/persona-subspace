It feels like a soft voice, a nod to the changing season.\n- **Too much?** Probably not \u2014 as long as it\u2019s subtle, short, and not overused. Since this is a small block of text, italics can actually help it feel more like a handwritten note or a gentle closing.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcdd Suggested approach:\n- Use **Lora Italic** for the full note (or just the closing line) to give it a warm, personal touch.\n- Keep the **type size** a bit smaller (maybe 10\u201312 pt) and the **leading** (line spacing) just a hair more generous to let it breathe.\n- **Center it** in the corner, maybe with a small margin from the edge of the page.\n\n---\n\n### Example (visual in text form):\n\n> *Fall\u2019s winding down, and the trees are just about ready to call it a season.
