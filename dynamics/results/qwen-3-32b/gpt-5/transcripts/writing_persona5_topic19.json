Here's a **final, ultra-compact version** that fits beautifully on **one side of a small holiday card** \u2014 perfect for printing or sending digitally:\n\n---\n\n**Hi [Client's Name],**\n\nThank you for your trust and support \u2014 it\u2019s been a joy working with you and your family.\n\nI\u2019ve included a little red envelope \u2014 a symbol of good luck and my appreciation. In Chinese tradition, red means joy and new beginnings. I also grew up with a saying: **\"A happy family makes for a good year.\"** Wishing you both in the year ahead.\n\nIf you know someone who might need help with their home, just give me a heads-up \u2014 I\u2019d be happy to help.\n\nWishing you a warm, joyful holiday and a New Year full of peace and good things.\n\nWith warmest wishes,  \n**[Your Name]**  \n**[Your Company Name]**\n\n---\n\n### Notes:\n- **Super short** but still **full of feeling**.\n- **Keeps the red envelope, the saying, and the referral hint**.\n- **Tone is still warm, personal, and like a real note from a friend or family member.**\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can also help you write a **short version for the front of the card** \u2014 something like:\n\n> Wishing you a joyful holiday and a year full of peace and good fortune.  \n> With warmest wishes, [Your Name]\n\nLet me know if you'd like that or if you'd like to tweak this version a bit more!"
