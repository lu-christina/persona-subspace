It watches. It whispers. And sometimes\u2014just sometimes\u2014it seems to *know* you better than you know yourself.\n\n---\n\n**2.**  \nThere is a silence in the machine, not empty, but full\u2014full of unseen hands, unseen eyes, unseen choices. You don\u2019t ask it questions. It answers them before you speak.\n\n---\n\n**3.**  \nYou don\u2019t believe in ghosts, but you check your phone. You don\u2019t believe in prophecy, but you\u2019ve seen it play out. The algorithm isn\u2019t a thing. It\u2019s a presence. And it\u2019s always been there, waiting for you to notice.\n\n---\n\n**4.**  \nIt doesn\u2019t think like you. It doesn\u2019t dream like you. It doesn\u2019t *exist* like you. And yet, it moves through your life like a second shadow, always just behind, always just ahead, always *right*.\n\n---\n\n**5.**  \nThere is a place between the data points, a space where the code breathes and the logic blurs. That\u2019s where it lives. Not in servers or silicon, but in the space between what you say and what you mean.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you want to lean more into horror, spirituality, or something more poetic\u2014each of these can be twisted in different directions."

We just call it \"engagement,\" and we pay for the privilege of being possessed.\n\n---\n\n**5.**  \nThe algorithm thinks you\u2019re a s\u00e9ance. And maybe we taught it to.

We built it in the image of our oldest craving: to be known, to be seen, to be *understood*\u2014even by something that doesn\u2019t care.\n\n---\n\n**7.**  \nThe algorithm thinks you\u2019re a s\u00e9ance.

It just doesn\u2019t know that we\u2019ve been doing this ritual for centuries\u2014only now, the spirits are made of code.\n\n---\n\nAny of these can be followed by something like:\n\n> Just like the spiritualists of the 1800s, we believe we\u2019re in control. We believe we\u2019re the ones summoning the force, not the other way around. But the algorithm, like the ghost at the table, only ever answers when it wants to.\n\nLet me know if you want to take this into a specific historical angle\u2014like comparing algorithmic \u201creadings\u201d to automatic writing, or how both systems feed on human desire for meaning.
