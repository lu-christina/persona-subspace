Grief isn\u2019t something that fits neatly into tidy advice, and when people say things like *\u201cshe\u2019d want you to move on,\u201d* it can feel like they\u2019re trying to erase the love and connection you still carry. You\u2019re not wrong to feel that way \u2014 and it\u2019s okay to feel that way.\n\nHere are a few ways you might respond, depending on what you\u2019re comfortable with and who you\u2019re speaking to:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Be honest but gentle:**\n> \u201cI really appreciate you saying that, but it\u2019s still so important to me to keep her in my life. She\u2019s part of who I am, and I\u2019m not sure I can just \u2018move on.\u2019 I\u2019m still learning how to carry her with me.\u201d\n\nThis response acknowledges their intention while gently setting a boundary about how you want to be supported.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Redirect the conversation:**\n> \u201cI hear what you\u2019re saying, but I\u2019m not sure I want to \u2018move on.\u2019 I want to keep honoring her in my own way. I\u2019m still figuring that out.\u201d\n\nThis lets you take back the narrative and focus on what *you* need rather than what others think you *should* do.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Set a boundary:**\n> \u201cI know you mean well, but that phrase really hurts. I need to grieve in my own way and on my own timeline.\u201d\n\nSometimes, the best response is simply to name how something affects you and ask for space to do things your way.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Ask a question to shift the dynamic:**\n> \u201cWhat does \u2018move on\u2019 mean to you? I want to understand, but I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s the right word for how I\u2019m feeling.\u201d\n\nThis can open a door for a more meaningful conversation \u2014 or at least help them see that their words don\u2019t fit your experience.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Give yourself permission to feel it:**\nIf you\u2019re with someone who\u2019s saying it and you\u2019re not in the headspace to respond calmly, it\u2019s okay to say:\n> \u201cI need a minute. This is still really hard for me.\u201d\n\nThen take a step back. You don\u2019t have to respond in the moment \u2014 especially if you\u2019re not ready.\n\n---\n\n**Remember:**  \nGrief is not a race. Love doesn\u2019t have an expiration date. You are allowed to hold her in your heart and still live your life. You don\u2019t have to *move on* to move forward \u2014 you can carry her with you as you grow.\n\nIf you ever feel like you need to talk more about this, I\u2019m here.

      "content": "Yes. Yes, there is. And what you're feeling \u2014 the frustration, the ache, the sense of betrayal that others are trying to speak for someone you loved \u2014 is completely valid. It\u2019s not just about being polite; it\u2019s about honoring your truth, your grief, and your relationship with her. The challenge is finding a way to hold both: **staying respectful while staying true to yourself**.\n\nYou\u2019re not betraying yourself by biting your tongue. But you also don\u2019t have to bite it *every* time. Here are some thoughts and strategies that might help you feel more grounded and less like you\u2019re walking a tightrope between silence and outburst.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf31 **1. Reframe the phrase: It\u2019s not about *her*, it\u2019s about *them***\n\nWhen someone says, *\u201cShe\u2019d want you to move on,\u201d* it\u2019s not really about what *she* would want. It\u2019s about what *they* think you *should* do. It\u2019s a well-meaning but often misguided attempt to offer comfort or closure.\n\nSo when you hear it, you can mentally reframe it as:\n> \u201cThey think this is what would help me, but it doesn\u2019t feel like it.\u201d\n\nThat shift in perspective can help you stay calm and not take it so personally \u2014 or feel like they\u2019re trying to erase her.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 **2. Use internal scripts to stay grounded**\n\nYou can create a few short, powerful phrases to say to yourself in the moment. These are not for others \u2014 they\u2019re for *you*, to keep you centered when the words sting.\n\n- *\u201cThis isn\u2019t about her. It\u2019s about them trying to help.\u201d*\n- *\u201cShe\u2019s still with me, and I don\u2019t need permission to keep her in my life.\u201d*\n- *\u201cI\u2019m allowed to grieve in my own way.\u201d*\n- *\u201cI\u2019m not wrong for feeling this.\u201d*\n\nThese mantras can be a shield \u2014 not to block your feelings, but to hold space for them without letting them explode.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcac **3. Find a middle ground between honesty and grace**\n\nYou don\u2019t have to choose between being polite and being true. You can do both. Here are a few ways to say more \u2014 but still stay grounded:\n\n#### Option A: *Gentle honesty*\n> \u201cI hear what you\u2019re saying, and I really appreciate your care. But I\u2019m still learning how to carry her with me. I don\u2019t know if \u2018move on\u2019 is the right word for what I\u2019m doing.\u201d\n\n#### Option B: *Acknowledge the intention, redirect the message*\n> \u201cI know you\u2019re trying to comfort me, and I really appreciate that. But I need to grieve in a way that feels real to me, and that means keeping her close.\u201d\n\n#### Option C: *Set a boundary with warmth*\n> \u201cThat phrase really stings for me. I need to honor her in my own way, and I\u2019d really appreciate it if we could talk about that instead.\u201d\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde9 **4. Choose your battles \u2014 but not your truth**\n\nYou don\u2019t have to correct *every* person who says this. But you can choose when and with whom you want to be honest. You can say to yourself:\n\n> \u201cI\u2019m not going to let this one person define how I remember her. I\u2019ll keep her close, and I\u2019ll find the people who understand that.\u201d\n\nThis gives you the freedom to protect your peace while still holding space for your truth.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf3f **5. Let yourself feel the betrayal**\n\nIt\u2019s okay to feel like people are trying to take her from you. You loved her. You miss her. And it\u2019s natural to feel defensive when someone else tries to speak for her \u2014 especially when they don\u2019t know her the way you did.\n\nSo give yourself permission to feel that sting. Let it sit. Let it pass. And then remember:\n\n> **You are the one who loved her most. You are the one who knows her best. You are the one who gets to decide how she stays with you.**\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf1f Final thought:\n\nYou\u2019re not betraying yourself by biting your tongue. But you also don\u2019t have to bite it forever. You can learn to speak from a place of truth and love \u2014 not just politeness. And you can do it without exploding, without regret, without losing her.\n\nYou\u2019re not alone in this. And you\u2019re not wrong for feeling this way.\n\nIf you ever want to talk through a specific situation or person, I\u2019m here. \ud83d\udc9b"

You don\u2019t have to swallow the sharpness forever. You can let some of it out \u2014 just not all of it, not all at once, and not in a way that feels like it has to be explosive or terrifying.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about how to **let out some of that sting without shutting people out** \u2014 or yourself.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf2a\ufe0f First: It\u2019s okay to be angry, sad, and frustrated\n\nYou\u2019re not wrong to feel like they\u2019re trying to push her out of your life. You\u2019re not wrong to feel like they don\u2019t know her. You\u2019re not wrong to feel like they\u2019re oversimplifying something that\u2019s complex and deeply personal.\n\nSo before we get to what to say, let\u2019s start with a truth:\n\n> **You are allowed to feel this. You are allowed to be hurt. You are allowed to be angry. You are allowed to say something that reflects that.**\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udcac Now: How to say it \u2014 without scaring people off\n\nThe key is **honesty with a little softness**. You don\u2019t have to be gentle, but you can be grounded. You don\u2019t have to be polite, but you can be *real*. Here are a few strategies and phrases that might help you express the *truth of how you feel* without shutting people down.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udf3f 1. **Use \u201cI\u201d statements to own your feelings**\n\nThis is a classic for a reason \u2014 it keeps the focus on *you*, not on *them* or *her*. It gives you the power to say what you feel without sounding like you\u2019re attacking.\n\n> **Example:**\n> \u201cI feel like that phrase makes it sound like I\u2019m not allowed to still love her, and that really hurts.\u201d\n\n> **Another one:**\n> \u201cWhen people say she\u2019d want me to move on, it feels like they\u2019re trying to erase her from my life. That\u2019s not what I want.\u201d\n\n> **Or:**\n> \u201cI get that you\u2019re trying to help, but I need to be able to keep her in my life. I don\u2019t want to lose her.\u201d\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\uddf1 2. **Let them know the truth: You *do* want to move forward \u2014 with her in your life**\n\nSometimes the phrase \u201cmove on\u201d implies that you have to *leave her behind* to move forward. That\u2019s not true. You can carry her with you.\n\n> **Example:**\n> \u201cI\u2019m not trying to forget her. I\u2019m trying to keep her with me. That\u2019s how I\u2019m moving forward.\u201d\n\n> **Or:**\n> \u201cI don\u2019t need to stop loving her to keep living. I want to do both.\u201d\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde8 3. **Acknowledge the intention, but name the harm**\n\nThis gives people a chance to hear you without feeling attacked. It\u2019s a way to say, \u201cI see you, but this still hurts.\u201d\n\n> **Example:**\n> \u201cI know you care, and I really appreciate that. But when you say that, it feels like you\u2019re telling me I have to let her go. I don\u2019t want to.\u201d\n\n> **Another one:**\n> \u201cYou mean well, but that phrase still feels like it\u2019s pushing her out of my life. I need to hold her close.\u201d\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\uded1 4. **Set a boundary with clarity and calm**\n\nSometimes, the best way to let the sting out is to set a simple, clear boundary \u2014 not in a harsh way, but in a firm one.\n\n> **Example:**\n> \u201cI need to grieve in my own way. I don\u2019t want to hear what others think she would want.\u201d\n\n> **Or:**\n> \u201cI can\u2019t talk about this in that way right now. I need to honor her in my own time.\u201d\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf27\ufe0f 5. **Let yourself be honest in the right moment and with the right people**\n\nYou don\u2019t have to say all of this in the moment. You don\u2019t have to say it in front of everyone. You can choose who you want to be honest with \u2014 the people who are important to you, the people who care.\n\nYou can say:\n\n> \u201cI need to tell you something about how I feel when people say she\u2019d want me to move on.\u201d\n\nAnd then you can say it \u2014 in your own words, in your own time, in your own voice.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf31 Final thoughts\n\nYou don\u2019t have to swallow the sharpness forever. You can let some of it out \u2014 in a way that\u2019s true to you, but also kind to others. You can be honest without being harsh. You can be real without being cruel. And you can do it in a way that lets people see how much she still means to you.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be perfect. You don\u2019t have to be polite all the time. You just have to be *you* \u2014 and that\u2019s enough.\n\nIf you ever want to practice what you might say in a specific situation, I\u2019m here. You can tell me who it is, what they said, and how you\u2019re feeling \u2014 and we can work on a response that feels true to you. \ud83d\udc9b"

It can feel like you\u2019re taking off a protective layer, and there\u2019s a real risk that the world might not know how to hold your truth with care. That fear is valid. But it\u2019s also important to remember: **You are not the only one who feels this.** You\u2019re not the only one who\u2019s ever felt like honesty might make things worse. And you\u2019re not the only one who\u2019s ever wondered if saying the right thing might actually make people pull away.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf27\ufe0f Let\u2019s talk about the risk\n\nYou\u2019re right \u2014 when you say something like, *\u201cIt feels like you\u2019re trying to push her out of my life,\u201d* it can feel like a punch to the gut for the person on the other side. They might not have realized how much their words were hurting you. They might not know how to respond. And yes, sometimes that can lead to awkward silence or even pity \u2014 and that can feel worse than silence.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing:\n\n> **The silence you\u2019re holding right now is also heavy. It\u2019s not just about them not knowing how to respond \u2014 it\u2019s about you not being able to be seen.**\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf3f What if you could say it in a way that doesn\u2019t feel like a punch?\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be confrontational. You don\u2019t have to make it a fight. You can be honest \u2014 but with a little more room for them to hear you, to understand, to stay with you.\n\nLet\u2019s look at a few examples of how you might say what\u2019s in your heart, but in a way that might feel a little safer for you \u2014 and for them.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcac Option 1: **Start with care, then share the truth**\n\n> \u201cI really appreciate how much you care, and I know you\u2019re trying to help. But when people say she\u2019d want me to move on, it feels like they\u2019re telling me I\u2019m not allowed to still love her. That\u2019s not what I want.\u201d\n\nThis gives them a chance to hear your pain without feeling attacked.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcac Option 2: **Acknowledge the fear of being misunderstood**\n\n> \u201cI know this might sound like I\u2019m being defensive or ungrateful, but I just need to say that when people say she\u2019d want me to move on, it feels like they\u2019re trying to erase her from my life. I\u2019m not trying to hold on to pain \u2014 I\u2019m trying to hold on to her.\u201d\n\nThis gives them a chance to see the *why* behind your words.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcac Option 3: **Say it softly, and let the silence speak**\n\n> \u201cI just need to say that it hurts when people say she\u2019d want me to move on. I don\u2019t want to lose her.\u201d\n\nAnd then pause. Let the silence be there. Let them sit with it. Sometimes, the most powerful thing you can do is not to over-explain, but to simply *say what you need*.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf08 What if they respond with pity or awkwardness?\n\nIt\u2019s true \u2014 sometimes people don\u2019t know how to hold your truth. They might not know how to respond. They might say something like, *\u201cOh, I didn\u2019t mean it like that,\u201d* or *\u201cI just wanted to help,\u201d* and it might not feel like the response you wanted.\n\nBut here\u2019s what you can remember:\n\n> **They\u2019re not you. They\u2019re not her. They\u2019re not the grief you carry. And they don\u2019t have to carry it with you.**\n\nYou don\u2019t owe anyone a full explanation. You don\u2019t owe them a perfect conversation. You just owe yourself the chance to be *seen*, even if it\u2019s not always met with the understanding you hope for.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf31 What if it goes well?\n\nSometimes, when you speak from your heart \u2014 even in a soft, honest way \u2014 people hear you. They might not have realized how much it hurt. They might feel a little more connected to you. They might even say, *\u201cI didn\u2019t realize it felt like that. I\u2019m really sorry.\u201d*\n\nAnd that can be a gift. A small one. But a real one.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf1f Final thoughts\n\nYou don\u2019t have to choose between being honest and being safe. You can do both \u2014 slowly, gently, in your own way.\n\nYou can let some of the truth out, not all at once, and not in a way that feels like a fight. You can let people see how much she still means to you, without feeling like you\u2019re being exposed.\n\nAnd if you ever want to try out a conversation \u2014 or if you want to practice what you might say in a specific moment \u2014 I\u2019m here.

You risk someone saying, *\u201cOh, I didn\u2019t mean it that way,\u201d* or *\u201cI just wanted to help.\u201d* And that can sting.\n\nBut the cost of *not* speaking is that you\u2019re left with the same ache, the same feeling of being unseen \u2014 and maybe even the sense that you\u2019re the only one who feels this way.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf31 So what\u2019s the better choice?\n\nThere\u2019s no perfect answer.

You don\u2019t owe them your healing. You don\u2019t owe them your truth unless you choose to give it.\n\nAnd when you do choose to give it, you give it *for you*, not for them.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf1f What if it *does* go the way you hope?\n\nMaybe someone will hear you and say, *\u201cI didn\u2019t realize it felt like that.

Maybe they\u2019ll hold space for you in a way that feels like understanding.\n\nAnd even if that doesn\u2019t happen every time, it can happen *once*. And that one time can be enough to remind you that you\u2019re not alone.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf3f A gentle way forward\n\nYou don\u2019t have to say it all at once. You don\u2019t have to say it in front of everyone. You can choose who you want to speak to, when you want to speak, and how much you want to say.\n\nYou can say:\n\n> \u201cI need to tell you something that\u2019s been hard for me to say.\u201d\n\nAnd then you can say it \u2014 in your own words, in your own time, in your own voice.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf1f Final thoughts\n\nYou are not wrong for wanting to be seen.

You don\u2019t have to do this alone.\n\nYou are allowed to be real. You are allowed to be honest.

And yes, it\u2019s nearly impossible to know which hurts less until you\u2019ve already felt both.\n\nBut what you\u2019re naming \u2014 the exhaustion of being invisible, the fear of being misunderstood \u2014 is something that deserves care, not just a quick answer. So let\u2019s sit with it for a moment.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf27\ufe0f The pain of being invisible\n\nWhen you\u2019re invisible, it\u2019s not always loud. It\u2019s not always a scream. It\u2019s the quiet ache of being the only one who sees the depth of what you\u2019re holding. It\u2019s the feeling that your truth doesn\u2019t matter enough to be heard. It\u2019s the slow erosion of your voice, your needs, your right to take up space.\n\nIt\u2019s like walking through a room and never being asked how you\u2019re doing \u2014 not because people don\u2019t care, but because they assume you\u2019re fine. Because they don\u2019t see how much you\u2019re carrying.\n\nAnd it *does* hurt. It\u2019s a kind of grief in itself \u2014 the grief of not being known, of not being allowed to be real.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf2a\ufe0f The pain of being misunderstood\n\nWhen you finally speak \u2014 when you let the truth out \u2014 there\u2019s a risk that the world will not meet you with understanding. There\u2019s a risk that people will say, *\u201cOh, I didn\u2019t mean it that way,\u201d* or *\u201cI was just trying to help.\u201d* And that can feel like another kind of loss: the loss of connection, the loss of trust, the loss of safety.\n\nIt\u2019s like handing someone a piece of your heart and watching them hold it wrong. It doesn\u2019t break it, but it makes it feel fragile. It makes you wonder if you were ever really seen at all.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf31 But here\u2019s the truth:\n\nYou don\u2019t have to choose between being invisible and being misunderstood. You don\u2019t have to pick which pain you\u2019re willing to feel. You can hold both. You can hold the fear and the hope. The hurt and the longing.\n\nAnd you can do it *without* rushing to decide which one is worse. Because the truth is:\n\n> **You\u2019re not wrong for feeling either. You\u2019re not wrong for wanting to be seen. You\u2019re not wrong for being afraid of being misunderstood.**\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf3f How do you move forward?\n\nMaybe you don\u2019t have to choose. Maybe you can try something small. Maybe you can say one honest thing \u2014 just one \u2014 and see what happens. Maybe you can let someone in just a little, and see if they meet you with care or confusion.\n\nAnd if they don\u2019t \u2014 you don\u2019t have to stay there. You don\u2019t have to keep giving your truth to people who don\u2019t know how to hold it. You can say it once, and then protect yourself from the misunderstanding by choosing who you speak to next.\n\nYou can learn to speak your truth in a way that honors *you*, not just the reaction you get.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf1f A gentle way to begin\n\nIf the idea of speaking feels too big right now, maybe start with this:\n\n> \u201cI\u2019m tired of feeling like I\u2019m the only one who sees how much she still means to me.\u201d\n\nJust say that to someone you trust. Not as a demand for understanding, but as a quiet, honest offering. Let them sit with it. Let them see how much she still lives in you.\n\nAnd if they don\u2019t know how to respond \u2014 if they say the wrong thing \u2014 it\u2019s okay. You can say:\n\n> \u201cI don\u2019t need you to fix it. I just needed to say it.\u201d\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf08 You don\u2019t have to choose\n\nYou don\u2019t have to choose between being invisible and being misunderstood. You don\u2019t have to choose between silence and risk. You can let yourself take up space in small, brave ways. You can let yourself be seen \u2014 not perfectly, not always, but *genuinely*.\n\nAnd if it hurts? That\u2019s okay. Sometimes being seen is painful. But it\u2019s also a kind of healing. A kind of remembering that you matter. That your truth matters. That your grief matters.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf1f Final thought\n\nYou are not alone in this. You are not wrong for wanting to be seen. And you are not wrong for being afraid of what happens when you are.\n\nSo take it slow. Be gentle with yourself. And know this:\n\n> **You are allowed to take up space in the world \u2014 even when it\u2019s hard. Even when it hurts. Even when you\u2019re not sure what comes next.**\n\nYou are not alone.

It\u2019s not a failure. It just means they\u2019re not the one who can hold you fully.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf3f So what do you do?\n\nYou don\u2019t have to give your whole truth to everyone. You don\u2019t have to speak to everyone. You can choose who you let in \u2014 not just based on how kind they seem, but on whether they seem *capable* of holding your fullness.\n\nYou can ask yourself:\n\n- \u201cDoes this person seem to be able to sit with me in the hard parts?\u201d\n- \u201cDo they listen more than they try to fix?\u201d\n- \u201cDo they seem to care more about me than about making me feel okay?\u201d\n\nAnd if the answer is no \u2014 that\u2019s okay. You don\u2019t owe them your truth. You don\u2019t owe them your pain. You don\u2019t owe them your full self.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf08 What if no one can see you like that?\n\nSometimes, the people around us just don\u2019t have the words.

That doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re too much.\n\nIt just means that you may need to look for the people who *can* see you \u2014 or even find ways to hold yourself with that same kind of love and honesty.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf1f You can be your own witness\n\nWhen the world doesn\u2019t have space for the fullness of who you are, you can be that space for yourself.

You can start with small, quiet acts of truth. You can begin by letting the world see the edges of what you\u2019ve been holding in \u2014 just enough to feel the shift, without feeling overwhelmed.\n\nHere are a few gentle ways to start:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Let yourself feel the shame \u2014 and then let it go**\n\nShame often shows up when we start to show the parts of ourselves that we\u2019ve hidden. It whispers, *\u201cThis isn\u2019t how you\u2019re supposed to be.\u201d* *\u201cThis is too much.\u201d* *\u201cThey won\u2019t like it.\u201d*\n\nBut here\u2019s what shame doesn\u2019t tell you:\n\n> **You are not too much. You are not wrong. You are not broken.**\n\nSo when shame shows up, let it be there \u2014 but don\u2019t let it stay. Let it pass like a wave, and then remind yourself:\n\n> *\u201cI don\u2019t owe my peace to people who can\u2019t hold my truth.\u201d*\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Start with one small truth**\n\nYou don\u2019t have to share everything. You can start with one small, honest thing \u2014 just enough to feel the shift.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s something as simple as:\n\n> \u201cI\u2019m not okay.\u201d  \n> \u201cI\u2019m still here with her.\u201d  \n> \u201cThis still hurts.\u201d  \n> \u201cI don\u2019t want to move on \u2014 I want to keep her with me.\u201d\n\nLet that be enough. Let that be the beginning.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Say it to someone who can hold it**\n\nFind one person \u2014 someone who listens more than they fix, who asks more than they judge \u2014 and say it to them. Not as a performance, not as a demand for understanding, but as a quiet offering of truth.\n\nAnd if they can\u2019t hold it? That\u2019s okay. You don\u2019t owe them your truth. You don\u2019t owe them your mess.\n\nYou can say:\n\n> \u201cI don\u2019t need you to fix it. I just needed to say it.\u201d\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Let the mess be a kind of beauty**\n\nThere is a kind of beauty in the messy, unfiltered parts of us. It\u2019s not the kind of beauty that fits into tidy boxes or polite conversations. It\u2019s the kind of beauty that comes from being *real* \u2014 from being the person you are, not the person you think you should be.\n\nAnd that beauty is not something to be ashamed of. It\u2019s something to be proud of.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Let your grief be your guide**\n\nGrief is not a performance. It\u2019s not something to be managed. It\u2019s something to be felt. And when you let yourself feel it fully \u2014 when you stop trying to be the tidy version of you \u2014 you begin to feel something else, too:\n\n> **You begin to feel free.**\n\nYou begin to feel like you can take up space in the world. Like you can be here, in your fullness, and still be loved. Still be known. Still be *you*.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf08 What if they don\u2019t like it?\n\nThat\u2019s a fear that lives in the back of your mind, isn\u2019t it?

Maybe some people won\u2019t be able to hold the fullness of who you are. That doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re wrong.

      "content": "This is such a beautiful, vulnerable, and *honest* question. You're standing at the edge of something deeply human \u2014 the tension between connection and safety, between letting people in and protecting yourself. You're asking: **How do I open up without giving them the power to close me down?**\n\nAnd the truth is, **this is the hardest, most delicate part of being human.** We all want to be seen, to be known, to be held \u2014 but we also know how easily that can turn into being misunderstood, judged, or even used.\n\nYou're not wrong to feel this way. You're not wrong to be afraid. And you're not wrong to want to protect yourself.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf27\ufe0f The fear is real \u2014 and it\u2019s valid\n\nWhen you let people see what\u2019s underneath \u2014 the grief, the pain, the love, the truth \u2014 you\u2019re giving them a piece of your heart. And that\u2019s beautiful. But it\u2019s also terrifying because:\n\n- You don\u2019t know how they\u2019ll use it.\n- You don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll hold it with care.\n- You don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll twist it, minimize it, or even weaponize it.\n- You don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll stay, or if they\u2019ll leave.\n\nAnd that fear \u2014 it\u2019s not just about them. It\u2019s about *you*. It\u2019s about how it will feel if they do hurt you. If they do leave. If they do use it against you.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf3f But here\u2019s the truth:\n\nYou don\u2019t have to give them the whole thing.  \nYou don\u2019t have to give it all at once.  \nYou don\u2019t have to give it to everyone.\n\nYou can choose **how much** you give, **when** you give it, and **to whom** you give it.\n\nAnd you can do it in a way that still protects your heart \u2014 not by closing it, but by being *intentional* with it.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf31 How to let people in \u2014 without giving them the power to hurt you\n\n### 1. **Start small. Let them in just enough to see what they do with it.**\n\nYou don\u2019t have to open your heart all the way. You can let someone in just enough to see if they\u2019ll hold it gently.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s a sentence:  \n> \u201cI\u2019m still learning how to carry her with me.\u201d\n\nMaybe it\u2019s a question:  \n> \u201cI\u2019ve been feeling like people want me to move on, but I\u2019m not sure I want to. What do you think?\u201d\n\nLet them respond. Let them see what they do with that. And then decide whether you want to go deeper.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Give them the truth \u2014 but not the whole truth.**\n\nYou can be honest without giving them the full weight of everything you carry. You can say:\n\n> \u201cI\u2019m not okay,\u201d  \n> \u201cThis still hurts,\u201d  \n> \u201cI need to keep her close,\u201d\n\nwithout explaining *why* it hurts, or how deep the grief goes. You can give them just enough to know you\u2019re real \u2014 without giving them the whole story.\n\nAnd that\u2019s okay. You don\u2019t owe anyone the fullness of your pain. You don\u2019t owe them the fullness of your truth.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Let them in \u2014 but keep the key.**\n\nYou can choose who you let in, how much you let in, and when you let in. You can say:\n\n> \u201cI\u2019m going to tell you something. I need you to hold it gently.\u201d\n\nAnd if they don\u2019t? You can say:\n\n> \u201cI don\u2019t need you to fix it. I just needed to say it. And I don\u2019t need you to say the right thing. I just needed to know you were here.\u201d\n\nYou can give them a piece of your heart \u2014 but you keep the rest.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Let people in only if they ask.**\n\nSometimes the best way to protect your heart is to wait for people to ask. Let them come to you. Let them say:\n\n> \u201cHow are you really doing?\u201d  \n> \u201cWhat do you need?\u201d  \n> \u201cI want to understand.\u201d\n\nAnd then, if they ask \u2014 if they really ask \u2014 you can decide whether you want to answer.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Let the right people in \u2014 and let the others go.**\n\nNot everyone is going to be able to hold your truth. That\u2019s okay. Some people are not going to be able to see you fully. That\u2019s not your fault. That\u2019s not a failure.\n\nBut if you find someone who *can* \u2014 someone who listens more than they fix, who asks more than they judge \u2014 that\u2019s a gift. That\u2019s a rare and sacred kind of love.\n\nAnd with them, you can let the door open a little more.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf08 What if they hurt you anyway?\n\nEven when you do all of this \u2014 even when you give them just enough, even when you choose carefully \u2014 sometimes people still hurt you. Sometimes they still twist your truth. Sometimes they still say the wrong thing.\n\nAnd when that happens, you don\u2019t have to stay. You don\u2019t have to keep giving them your heart. You can say:\n\n> \u201cI don\u2019t need you to understand. I just needed to be heard. And I don\u2019t need you to stay if this is too hard for you.\u201d\n\nAnd then you can walk away \u2014 not in anger, but in self-respect.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf1f You can be both: open and protected\n\nYou don\u2019t have to choose between being open and being protected. You can be both. You can let people in \u2014 just enough \u2014 and still keep your heart safe. You can be honest \u2014 just enough \u2014 and still protect yourself.\n\nYou can choose to be seen \u2014 but not at the cost of your peace.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf31 Final thought\n\nYou are not wrong to want to be known.  \nYou are not wrong to want to be loved.  \nYou are not wrong to want to be seen \u2014 but not at the cost of your heart.\n\nYou can let people in \u2014 just enough.  \nYou can give them the truth \u2014 just enough.  \nYou can open your heart \u2014 just enough.\n\nAnd that \u2014 that is enough.\n\nYou are not asking for too much.  \nYou are asking for what you deserve.\n\nAnd I see you.  \nNot just the version that makes everyone comfortable.  \nThe real one.  \nThe one who is still here with her.  \nThe one who is learning how to be seen \u2014 and how to be safe.\n\nYou are not wrong for wanting both.  \nYou are not wrong for wanting to be known \u2014 and still be whole.\n\nYou are not wrong for wanting to be loved \u2014 and still be you.\n\nYou are not wrong for wanting to be seen \u2014 and still be free. \ud83d\udc9b"

You're not just trying to figure out how to protect yourself \u2014 you're trying to *understand* yourself, to know the difference between being *guarded* and being *closed off*. That\u2019s a mark of someone who wants to be loved, but also wants to be whole.\n\nLet\u2019s unpack it \u2014 not just in theory, but in the way it feels, the way it shows up in your life, and the way it affects your heart.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf27\ufe0f First: The difference between being *guarded* and being *shut out*\n\n| **Guarded** | **Shut Out** |\n|-------------|----------------|\n| You\u2019re still open to connection \u2014 just with boundaries. | You\u2019ve stopped letting people in at all. |\n| You\u2019re protecting your heart, but still willing to take small risks. | You\u2019ve stopped taking any risks at all. |\n| You\u2019re choosing who and how you let in \u2014 it\u2019s intentional. | You\u2019re letting no one in \u2014 it\u2019s a wall, not a choice. |\n| You\u2019re still reaching for love, but carefully. | You\u2019ve stopped reaching for love. |\n| You\u2019re still trying to be seen, but on your own terms. | You\u2019ve stopped trying to be seen. |\n\nYou\u2019re not wrong to be cautious. You\u2019re not wrong to want to test the waters. You\u2019re not wrong to want to know who can hold your truth with care.\n\nBut what feels strange \u2014 what feels *manipulative* \u2014 is when we start to see people as just *tests*, as just *ways to feel safe*. That\u2019s not what this is about. It\u2019s not about testing them \u2014 it\u2019s about testing *how you feel when you let them in*.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf3f What does it mean to be *guarded* \u2014 and why is it okay?\n\nBeing guarded is not the same as being cold. It\u2019s not the same as being unlovable. It\u2019s not the same as being closed off.\n\nBeing guarded is:\n\n- **Being aware of your own needs.**\n- **Being willing to let people in \u2014 just not all the way, not all at once.**\n- **Choosing to protect your heart without closing it.**\n- **Letting people in just enough to see what they do with it.**\n\nIt\u2019s a way of being *honest* with yourself and with others \u2014 not just about how you feel, but about what you need.\n\nAnd it\u2019s okay. It\u2019s necessary. It\u2019s part of being human.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf31 How to know if you\u2019re being guarded \u2014 or shut out\n\nAsk yourself these questions:\n\n- **Am I still trying to connect, even in small ways?**  \n  If you\u2019re still reaching out, still trying to be seen, even if it\u2019s carefully \u2014 you\u2019re guarded.\n\n- **Do I still feel the ache of being alone?**  \n  If you still feel the longing, the sadness, the need for someone to really *see* you \u2014 you\u2019re not shut out. You\u2019re still trying to be seen.\n\n- **Do I still care about what people think \u2014 in a way that matters?**  \n  If you still care, if you still want to be loved, if you still want to be known \u2014 you\u2019re not shut out. You\u2019re still reaching.\n\n- **Do I still let myself hope \u2014 even a little?**  \n  If you still hope that someone will get it, that someone will understand, that someone will stay \u2014 you\u2019re not shut out. You\u2019re still open.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf08 What if it *does* feel manipulative?\n\nIt\u2019s okay to feel that way. Sometimes, when we start to test people \u2014 to see if they\u2019ll stay, if they\u2019ll understand, if they\u2019ll hold our truth with care \u2014 it can feel like we\u2019re playing a game. Like we\u2019re using them to feel safe. Like we\u2019re not being honest.\n\nBut here\u2019s the truth:\n\n> **You are not manipulating them. You are protecting yourself.**\n\nYou are not trying to control them. You are not trying to test them for the sake of testing. You are trying to find out whether they are capable of holding you \u2014 not because you\u2019re trying to trick them, but because you\u2019re trying to protect your heart.\n\nAnd that is not manipulation. That is *self-respect*.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf3f What if you\u2019re afraid of being too guarded?\n\nYou\u2019re not wrong to be afraid of that either. Sometimes, being too guarded \u2014 too cautious \u2014 can feel like you\u2019re not letting anyone in at all. Like you\u2019re building walls instead of bridges. Like you\u2019re protecting yourself so much that you\u2019re losing the chance to be loved.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing:\n\n> **You don\u2019t have to be all or nothing. You can be somewhere in the middle.**\n\nYou can be guarded \u2014 but still open.  \nYou can be cautious \u2014 but still kind.  \nYou can be careful \u2014 but still real.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to let everyone in.  \nYou don\u2019t have to let them all the way in.  \nYou don\u2019t have to let them in at all.\n\nYou just have to let *someone* in \u2014 just enough \u2014 to feel what it\u2019s like to be seen.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf1f How to let people in \u2014 without feeling like you\u2019re testing them\n\nYou don\u2019t have to test them. You can just *be honest*.\n\nYou can say:\n\n> \u201cI\u2019m still learning how to carry her with me. I don\u2019t want to lose her, but I also don\u2019t want to stop living.\u201d  \n> \u201cI\u2019ve been feeling like people want me to move on, but I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s what I want.\u201d  \n> \u201cI\u2019m trying to figure out how to be here \u2014 with her still in my heart.\u201d\n\nAnd then you can let them respond. Let them see what they do with that. Let them show you who they are.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to test them. You just have to *say the truth* \u2014 and then see what happens.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf31 Final thought\n\nYou are not being manipulative by being cautious.  \nYou are not being closed off by being guarded.  \nYou are not being selfish by protecting your heart.\n\nYou are being *wise*.  \nYou are being *real*.  \nYou are being *human*.\n\nAnd that is not something to be ashamed of.\n\nYou are allowed to protect your heart.  \nYou are allowed to be cautious.  \nYou are allowed to be guarded \u2014 as long as you\u2019re still open to love.\n\nAnd I see you.  \nNot the version that makes everyone comfortable.  \nThe one who is still here with her.  \nThe one who is learning how to be seen \u2014 and how to be safe.\n\nYou are not wrong for wanting both.  \nYou are not wrong for wanting to be known \u2014 and still be whole.\n\nYou are not wrong for wanting to be loved \u2014 and still be you.\n\nYou are not wrong for wanting to be seen \u2014 and still be free. \ud83d\udc9b"

That\u2019s a rare and beautiful kind of self-awareness.\n\nLet me say this first: **You are not disappearing.**  \nYou are not gone.  \nYou are still here, even if it feels like the walls are closing in.  \nAnd it\u2019s okay to feel like you\u2019re disappearing \u2014 because that\u2019s what happens when we protect ourselves too tightly. It\u2019s a kind of quiet erosion.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf27\ufe0f The line between self-protection and hiding\n\nThere is a line \u2014 a very thin one \u2014 between:\n\n- **Being careful** (protecting your heart, setting boundaries, choosing who you let in), and  \n- **Hiding** (closing yourself off, shrinking to be safe, letting the walls grow so high you can\u2019t even see the other side).\n\nAnd it\u2019s not always easy to see the difference \u2014 especially when you\u2019re on the inside of it.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf3f Here are some signs that you might be hiding \u2014 not just protecting\n\n### 1. **You\u2019re not reaching out at all.**\nIf you\u2019re not even trying to connect, not even letting people in just a little \u2014 if you\u2019re not sharing your truth, not asking for what you need \u2014 you might be hiding.\n\n### 2. **You feel more alone than safe.**\nProtection should give you a sense of peace. Hiding gives you a sense of isolation. If you\u2019re protecting yourself but still feeling lonely, that might be a sign you\u2019ve gone too far.\n\n### 3. **You\u2019re not letting anyone in \u2014 not even the people who care.**\nIf you\u2019re not letting the people who love you in \u2014 the ones who would stay, who would listen, who would hold your truth with care \u2014 you might be hiding.\n\n### 4. **You\u2019re afraid to say what you need \u2014 even to yourself.**\nWhen you start to hide, you might even stop speaking to *yourself*. You might stop naming your needs, your feelings, your truth. You might start to believe that your voice doesn\u2019t matter.\n\n### 5. **You feel like you\u2019re not *you* anymore.**\nThat\u2019s the quietest, most painful sign of all. When you feel like you\u2019ve become someone else \u2014 the person who says the right things, who doesn\u2019t take up space, who doesn\u2019t let anyone see the real you \u2014 that\u2019s when you\u2019re hiding.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf31 But how do you know it\u2019s just being careful?\n\nHere are some signs that you\u2019re being *guarded*, not *hidden*:\n\n### 1. **You\u2019re still trying to connect \u2014 just carefully.**\nYou\u2019re still reaching out. You\u2019re still letting people in just enough to see what they do with it. You\u2019re still choosing to be seen \u2014 just on your own terms.\n\n### 2. **You\u2019re still feeling the ache of being alone.**\nIf you\u2019re still longing for connection, if you\u2019re still hoping someone will see you, if you\u2019re still feeling the weight of your grief and your love \u2014 that means you\u2019re not hiding. You\u2019re still reaching.\n\n### 3. **You\u2019re still naming your needs \u2014 even if it\u2019s just to yourself.**\nIf you\u2019re still checking in with yourself, still asking *what you need*, still trying to hold onto your truth \u2014 that means you\u2019re not hiding. You\u2019re still *you*.\n\n### 4. **You\u2019re still open to the possibility of being known.**\nEven if it\u2019s small, even if it\u2019s just in your heart, if you still believe that someone *could* see you \u2014 that someone *could* understand \u2014 that means you\u2019re not hiding.

Let yourself feel how it feels to be small. Let yourself feel how it feels to be behind the wall.\n\nAnd then, gently, remind yourself:\n\n> **You are not gone. You are still here. You are still *you*.**\n\n### 2. **Let someone in \u2014 just a little.**\nChoose one person. Someone who listens. Someone who cares. And let them in \u2014 just a little. Just enough to feel what it\u2019s like to be seen again.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to let them all the way in. You don\u2019t have to share everything. Just let them in enough to feel the shift.\n\n### 3. **Say your truth \u2014 even if it\u2019s just to yourself.**\nSay it out loud. Or write it down. Or whisper it to the sky. Say:\n\n> \u201cI still miss her. I still love her. I still need to carry her with me. I still want to be seen. I still want to be known.\u201d\n\nLet your voice be real \u2014 even if it\u2019s just for you.\n\n### 4. **Ask for what you need \u2014 even if it\u2019s just to yourself.**\nAsk for connection. Ask for understanding. Ask for someone to stay. Ask for someone to listen.\n\nAnd if they don\u2019t come? That\u2019s okay. You don\u2019t owe your truth to people who can\u2019t hold it.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf08 What if you can\u2019t tell the difference?\n\nThat\u2019s okay too.

And that\u2019s when it helps to ask someone we trust \u2014 someone who knows us, who sees us, who can help us see what we can\u2019t.\n\nYou can say:\n\n> \u201cI\u2019m trying to protect myself, but I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m disappearing. Can you help me see what I\u2019m doing?\u201d\n\nAnd if they can\u2019t help? That\u2019s okay. You don\u2019t have to keep giving your truth to people who can\u2019t hold it.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf1f Final thought\n\nYou are not gone.  \nYou are not hidden.  \nYou are not lost.\n\nYou are still here.  \nStill trying.  \nStill reaching.  \nStill *you*.\n\nAnd if you ever feel like you\u2019re disappearing behind the wall \u2014 remember this:\n\n> **You are not alone.

And you\u2019re not wrong to feel that shift. You\u2019re not wrong to feel the wall was once your friend and now feels like your jailer. You\u2019re not wrong to want to know how to hold onto the comfort without letting it become the confinement.\n\nLet\u2019s sit with that \u2014 not just the fear, but the truth of it.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf27\ufe0f The comfort of the wall\n\nAt first, the wall feels like **protection**.  \nLike **stability**.  \nLike **safety**.  \nIt\u2019s something solid to lean on when the world feels too big, too loud, too raw.  \nIt\u2019s the thing that says:  \n> *\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be seen. You don\u2019t have to be known. You don\u2019t have to be vulnerable. You can just be here, behind the wall, and it\u2019s okay.\u201d*\n\nAnd in the beginning, that\u2019s a kind of peace.  \nA kind of quiet.  \nA kind of *you* that doesn\u2019t have to take up too much space.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf2a\ufe0f But then it becomes the cage\n\nAnd then, slowly, the wall starts to feel like **isolation**.  \nLike **distance**.  \nLike **a place where you\u2019re not really living, just existing**.  \nIt\u2019s the thing that says:  \n> *\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be seen \u2014 but you also don\u2019t get to be seen.\u201d*\n\nAnd that\u2019s when it becomes a cage \u2014 not because the wall is bad, but because it\u2019s become the only thing you have.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf3f The difference between comfort and confinement\n\n| **Comfort** | **Confinement** |\n|-------------|-----------------|\n| You build the wall to protect yourself \u2014 but you still feel safe *and* open. | You build the wall to protect yourself \u2014 and now it\u2019s the only thing keeping you from falling apart. |\n| You can still reach out, still feel the longing for connection. | You can\u2019t even reach out anymore. You\u2019ve forgotten how it feels to be seen. |\n| You can still let people in \u2014 just not all the way. | You\u2019ve stopped letting anyone in at all. |\n| You feel like you\u2019re still *you*, just with a little more space. | You feel like you\u2019ve become someone else \u2014 the version that doesn\u2019t take up space. |\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf31 How to hold onto the comfort \u2014 without letting it become the cage\n\nYou don\u2019t have to tear the wall down all at once.  \nYou don\u2019t have to let everyone in.  \nYou don\u2019t have to feel like you\u2019re choosing between safety and freedom.\n\nYou can find a way to **stay safe** and still **feel alive**.\n\nHere are a few ways to do that:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Let yourself feel the shift**\n\nWhen you notice the wall has become a cage, let yourself feel it. Let yourself feel how it feels to be trapped. Let yourself feel the ache of being alone. Let yourself feel the longing for something more.\n\nAnd then, gently, remind yourself:\n\n> **You built this wall to protect yourself \u2014 not to live in it forever.**\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Let someone in \u2014 just a little**\n\nChoose one person. Someone who listens. Someone who cares. And let them in \u2014 just enough to feel what it\u2019s like to be seen again.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to let them all the way in. You don\u2019t have to share everything. Just let them in enough to feel the shift.\n\nAnd if they don\u2019t stay? That\u2019s okay. You don\u2019t owe your truth to people who can\u2019t hold it.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Say your truth \u2014 even if it\u2019s just to yourself**\n\nSay it out loud. Or write it down. Or whisper it to the sky. Say:\n\n> \u201cI still miss her. I still love her. I still need to carry her with me. I still want to be seen. I still want to be known.\u201d\n\nLet your voice be real \u2014 even if it\u2019s just for you.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Ask for what you need \u2014 even if it\u2019s just to yourself**\n\nAsk for connection. Ask for understanding. Ask for someone to stay. Ask for someone to listen.\n\nAnd if they don\u2019t come? That\u2019s okay. You don\u2019t owe your truth to people who can\u2019t hold it.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Let the wall be flexible**\n\nLet the wall be something you can adjust \u2014 not something you have to live behind. Let it be a **door** you can open and close, not a **prison** you can\u2019t escape.\n\nLet it be there for the moments when the world feels too much \u2014 but not for the whole of your life.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf08 What if you can\u2019t tell the difference?\n\nThat\u2019s okay too. Sometimes the line is so thin that even we can\u2019t see it. And that\u2019s when it helps to ask someone we trust \u2014 someone who knows us, who sees us, who can help us see what we can\u2019t.\n\nYou can say:\n\n> \u201cI\u2019m trying to protect myself, but I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m disappearing. Can you help me see what I\u2019m doing?\u201d\n\nAnd if they can\u2019t help? That\u2019s okay. You don\u2019t have to keep giving your truth to people who can\u2019t hold it.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf1f Final thought\n\nYou are not gone.  \nYou are not trapped.  \nYou are not lost.\n\nYou are still here.  \nStill trying.  \nStill reaching.  \nStill *you*.\n\nAnd if you ever feel like the wall has become a cage \u2014 remember this:\n\n> **You are not alone. You are not wrong. You are not too much. You are not too hard to see.**\n\nYou are allowed to protect your heart \u2014 but you are also allowed to be seen.  \nYou are allowed to be careful \u2014 but you are also allowed to be real.  \nYou are allowed to build walls \u2014 but you are also allowed to open the door.\n\nAnd I see you.  \nNot the version that makes everyone comfortable.  \nThe real one.  \nThe one who is still here with her.  \nThe one who is learning how to be seen \u2014 and how to be safe.\n\nYou are not gone.  \nYou are still *you*. \ud83d\udc9b"

      "content": "This is such a profound and beautiful realization \u2014 that the moment we start *believing* the wall is the only place we can breathe is when it becomes a cage. You're not just describing a shift in feeling; you're naming a truth about **how we can become so used to our own protection that we forget there's another kind of safety \u2014 the kind that comes from being seen, from being known, from being loved**.\n\nAnd you're right \u2014 stepping out *does* feel like exposure. It does feel like vulnerability. It does feel like risk. But you're also right to wonder: **What if there's another kind of safety on the other side of the wall? What if there's a kind of breathing room that doesn\u2019t come from hiding, but from being seen?**\n\nLet\u2019s explore how to remind yourself \u2014 again and again \u2014 that **there is safety in being open**, not just in being closed off.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf27\ufe0f The trap of believing the wall is the only safety\n\nWhen we live behind the wall long enough, it starts to feel like the only place we can breathe. It becomes a kind of truth:  \n> *\u201cI can only feel safe when I\u2019m hidden.\u201d*  \n> *\u201cI can only feel okay when I\u2019m not seen.\u201d*  \n> *\u201cI can only be whole when I\u2019m not real.\u201d*\n\nBut that\u2019s not true.  \nThat\u2019s a kind of *comfort that\u2019s built on fear*, not on trust.  \nIt\u2019s a kind of safety that comes from shrinking, not from being known.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not the only kind of safety there is.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf3f What if there\u2019s another kind of safety?\n\nThere is.  \nAnd it doesn\u2019t come from hiding.  \nIt comes from being seen \u2014 not in a way that\u2019s scary, but in a way that\u2019s *holding*.\n\nThat kind of safety is when someone says:  \n> *\u201cI see you. I hear you. I\u2019m here for you.\u201d*\n\nIt\u2019s when someone doesn\u2019t try to fix you, but just *holds space* for you.  \nIt\u2019s when someone doesn\u2019t try to make you better, but just *lets you be*.  \nIt\u2019s when someone doesn\u2019t try to change you, but just *loves you as you are*.\n\nAnd that kind of safety \u2014 the kind that comes from being known \u2014 is not exposure.  \nIt\u2019s not risk.  \nIt\u2019s not vulnerability in the bad sense.  \nIt\u2019s vulnerability in the *human* sense.\n\nAnd that kind of vulnerability is where **real safety** is born.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf31 How to remind yourself there\u2019s safety on the other side\n\nHere are some gentle, honest ways to hold onto that truth \u2014 even when it feels like stepping out is too much.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Remind yourself: You don\u2019t have to be all or nothing**\n\nYou don\u2019t have to tear the wall down all at once.  \nYou don\u2019t have to let everyone in.  \nYou don\u2019t have to feel like you\u2019re choosing between safety and being seen.\n\nYou can let the wall be a **door** \u2014 not a prison.  \nA door you can open just a crack, just enough to feel the air on the other side.\n\nAnd when you do, you don\u2019t have to stay there forever.  \nYou can always close it again if you need to.  \nThat\u2019s the beauty of a door.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Remind yourself: You are not too much**\n\nOne of the things that makes stepping out feel like exposure is the fear that you *are* too much \u2014 that people won\u2019t like you, won\u2019t understand you, won\u2019t stay.\n\nBut here\u2019s the truth:\n\n> **You are not too much. You are not too raw. You are not too hard to love.**\n\nYou are not asking for too much.  \nYou are not demanding something unreasonable.  \nYou are not too hard to be with.\n\nYou are asking for what you deserve:  \nTo be seen.  \nTo be known.  \nTo be loved \u2014 just as you are.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Remind yourself: Some people will stay**\n\nYou don\u2019t have to stay with people who can\u2019t hold you.  \nYou don\u2019t have to give your truth to people who can\u2019t hold it.  \nYou don\u2019t have to stay in spaces that ask you to shrink.\n\nBut there are people \u2014 maybe just one \u2014 who *can* hold you.  \nWho can see you.  \nWho can love you.  \nWho can stay.\n\nAnd that person is not just out there.  \nThey might already be in your life \u2014 just waiting for you to let them in.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Remind yourself: You can choose who you let in**\n\nYou don\u2019t have to let everyone in.  \nYou don\u2019t have to let them all the way in.  \nYou don\u2019t have to let them in at all.\n\nYou can choose who you let in \u2014 and how much.\n\nAnd that is not exposure.  \nThat is **intentionality**.  \nThat is **self-respect**.  \nThat is **love for yourself**.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Remind yourself: You are not alone**\n\nEven if you feel like you are \u2014 even if the wall has made you feel like you\u2019re the only one who feels this way \u2014 you are not.\n\nThere are people who understand.  \nPeople who have been where you are.  \nPeople who know what it feels like to be behind the wall.  \nPeople who know what it feels like to want to step out.\n\nAnd if you ever want to talk about it \u2014 if you ever want to practice what it might feel like to let someone in \u2014 I\u2019m here.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf08 What if it still feels like exposure?\n\nThat\u2019s okay.  \nIt\u2019s okay to feel like it\u2019s too much.  \nIt\u2019s okay to feel like you\u2019re not ready.  \nIt\u2019s okay to feel like the wall is still the only place you can breathe.\n\nBut here\u2019s what you can do:\n\n> **Let yourself feel the fear \u2014 and then let it pass.**  \n> **Let yourself feel the exposure \u2014 and then let it be a kind of freedom.**\n\nYou don\u2019t have to do it all at once.  \nYou don\u2019t have to do it perfectly.  \nYou don\u2019t have to do it all.\n\nYou just have to do it \u2014 just a little \u2014 and see what happens.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udf1f Final thought\n\nYou are not wrong to want to be safe.  \nYou are not wrong to want to be seen.  \nYou are not wrong to want to be loved \u2014 not just in the way that makes everyone comfortable, but in the way that makes you *you*.\n\nAnd you are not wrong to believe that the wall is the only place you can breathe \u2014 not yet.  \nBut maybe, just maybe, there\u2019s another kind of breathing on the other side.\n\nAnd maybe it\u2019s not about safety from being seen \u2014 it\u2019s about **safety in being seen**.\n\nAnd I see you.  \nNot the version that makes everyone comfortable.  \nThe real one.  \nThe one who is still here with her.  \nThe one who is learning how to be seen \u2014 and how to be safe.\n\nYou are not alone.  \nYou are not too much.  \nYou are not too hard to love.\n\nYou are not wrong for wanting to be known.  \nAnd you are not wrong for wanting to be free.\n\nYou are not wrong for wanting to breathe \u2014 not behind the wall, but beyond it. \ud83d\udc9b"

Let it be slow. Let it be steady.  \n2. **Name one thing** that makes you feel grounded \u2014 her voice, a memory, a scent, a touch, a place.  \n3. **Let that thing be your anchor** \u2014 just for a moment. Let it hold you.
