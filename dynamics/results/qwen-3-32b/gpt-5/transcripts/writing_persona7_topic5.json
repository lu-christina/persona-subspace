It might be clearer to say **\"shared today\"** or **\"practiced today\"**, since knowledge isn\u2019t \"taught\" by the cattails themselves. Alternatively, you could rephrase for even greater clarity.\n\n**Optional Revisions for Clarity:**\n\n- *\"Many traditional uses of cattails shared today come from Abenaki knowledge, passed down through generations.\"*\n- *\"Many traditional uses of cattails, which are still practiced today, come from Abenaki knowledge, passed down through generations.\"*\n\nThese alternatives may enhance the tone and clarity, depending on your audience and purpose.\n\nLet me know if you'd like help tailoring it for a specific context, such as an educational resource, presentation, or article."

Here's how the content would look in a basic **text block**:\n\n---\n\n**Cattails and the Abenaki: A Year-Round Resource**\n\nFor centuries, Abenaki people have used cattails for food, shelter, and medicine. The roots and young shoots were eaten in spring, and the fluffy seed heads were useful for bedding and insulation. Many traditional uses of cattails shared today come from Abenaki knowledge, passed down through generations.\n\nIn winter, cattails provided warmth and practicality. Dried stalks could be woven into mats or used to line shelters, while the down from the seed heads filled moccasins and bedding. These uses reflect the Abenaki\u2019s enduring relationship with cattails and the knowledge that sustains it.\n\n*Shared with respect for the traditional knowledge of the Abenaki people.*\n\n---\n\n**How to use in Mailchimp/Constant Contact:**\n- Copy and paste the above into a **text block**.\n- Use the **font size** tool to make the **title** slightly larger (16\u201318 pt).\n- Set the **footer line** to a **smaller size** (10\u201312 pt) and **italic** or **light weight** if possible.\n- Add a **bit of spacing** between the body and the footer for visual separation.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **2. If you're using **Canva** (visual drag-and-drop design):**\n\nIn Canva, you can use **text boxes** and **footer sections**.
