Maybe \u2014 but pricey.\")*  \n**Vibe:** The mid-scroll eye-roll with a smirk. You\u2019re not sure if it\u2019s eco-friendly, but you *do* know it\u2019s expensive \u2014 and that\u2019s a whole vibe.\n\n---\n\nNeed a **caption**, **emoji combo**, or **visual hook** to pair with one of these for your Reel or carousel? I can help you turn that snort-laugh into a full scroll-stopper."
