Drying is a fantastic way to extend their life and intensify their flavor!\n\n**Here's the gist:**\n\n* **Clean:** Gently brush off dirt. Don't wash unless absolutely necessary.\n* **Slice:** Thinner slices dry faster.\n* **Dry:** Use a dehydrator, oven on low heat (135-145\u00b0F), or even a sunny spot with good airflow.\n* **Store:** Once completely dry and brittle, store in airtight containers in a cool, dark place.\n\nDried mushrooms rehydrate beautifully in soups, stews, and sauces. They also make a delicious and concentrated snack!"
