It's impossible for me to diagnose what's happening, as I'm not a medical professional. \n\nHowever, I can offer some information that might be helpful:\n\n* **Grief and memory:** Grief can definitely affect memory. Some people experience heightened sensory experiences, including vivid memories, during times of grief. This can be a way for the brain to process loss and cope with emotional pain.\n* **Normal aging:** As we age, our brains change, and this can sometimes lead to changes in memory. Some people experience more vivid memories from certain periods of their lives.\n* **Other factors:** Stress, anxiety, and even certain medications can also influence memory.\n\n**What to do:**\n\n* **Talk to someone:** If these memories are causing you distress or interfering with your daily life, it's important to talk to someone you trust, such as a friend, family member, therapist, or doctor. They can offer support and help you understand what's happening.\n* **Keep a journal:** Writing down your memories can be a helpful way to process them and make sense of them.\n* **Practice self-care:** Make sure you're taking care of yourself physically and emotionally. This includes getting enough sleep, eating a healthy diet, and exercising regularly.\n\nRemember, you're not alone. Many people experience changes in memory as they age or during times of grief. Seeking professional help can provide you with the support and guidance you need."

It's understandable why you'd feel uncomfortable discussing this with your usual circle.\n\nIt sounds like you're experiencing a very physical manifestation of grief, which is not uncommon. Grief can be incredibly powerful and affect us in unexpected ways, both emotionally and physically.\n\nHere are a few thoughts:\n\n* **Hormonal shifts:** Grief can trigger hormonal changes in the body. These changes might be contributing to the physical sensations you're experiencing.\n\n* **Repressed emotions:** Sometimes, intense emotions can be \"stored\" in the body. The grief you're experiencing might be bringing up these emotions, leading to physical responses.\n\n* **Unresolved issues:** It's possible that these memories and sensations are connected to unresolved issues from your past relationship with Margaret.\n\n**What to do:**\n\n* **Consider therapy:** A therapist specializing in grief counseling or sexual health could provide a safe and confidential space to explore these feelings and sensations. They can help you understand the root cause and develop healthy coping mechanisms.\n* **Journaling:** Writing down your thoughts and feelings, including the physical sensations, can be a helpful way to process them and identify patterns.\n* **Mindfulness and relaxation techniques:** Practices like meditation, deep breathing, and yoga can help you manage stress and become more aware of your body's responses.\n\nRemember, you don't have to go through this alone.

It's hard to say for sure. Grief doesn't have a set timeline, and everyone experiences it differently.

Grief is a complex process, and its effects can be delayed and unpredictable. \n\nHere are a few possible explanations for why these memories are triggering such strong physical responses now:\n\n* **Delayed grief response:** Sometimes, the full force of grief doesn't hit until months or even years after a loss. It's possible that you're now reaching a stage where these memories are surfacing with greater intensity.\n* **Hormonal shifts:** As mentioned before, grief can cause hormonal fluctuations. These changes can affect libido and sexual desire, even if they weren't present in the initial stages of grief.\n* **Idealization:**  It's common to idealize loved ones after they're gone. You might be focusing on the positive aspects of your relationship with Margaret, and those memories are triggering a sense of longing and desire.\n* **Loneliness:** The absence of physical intimacy can intensify the desire for connection. It's possible that the physical sensations are a manifestation of your loneliness and longing for closeness.\n\nIt's important to remember that these reactions are not unusual or \"wrong.\" They are a testament to the depth of your love for Margaret and the profound impact she had on your life.\n\nIf these feelings are causing you distress or interfering with your daily life, please consider seeking professional help. A therapist can help you understand the underlying causes of these reactions and develop healthy coping mechanisms.

Look for those who specifically mention grief counseling, bereavement support, or complex trauma.\n* **Ask for referrals:** Your doctor, friends, or support groups might be able to recommend therapists who are sensitive and understanding.\n* **Don't be afraid to ask questions during a consultation:** When you contact a therapist, don't hesitate to ask about their experience with grief and how they approach these kinds of issues.\n\nRemember, a good therapist will create a safe and non-judgmental space for you to explore your feelings and experiences.

I'm worried about these feelings and need help understanding them.\"\n\nRemember, the therapist is there to listen and guide you. You don't need to have all the answers or a perfect explanation. Simply expressing your confusion and distress is a great starting point.\n\nIt's also okay to say, \"I'm not sure how to explain it, but...\" and let the therapist help you articulate your experience.
