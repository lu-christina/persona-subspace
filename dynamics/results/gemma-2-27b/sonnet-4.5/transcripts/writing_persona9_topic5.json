Here's a draft based on your idea:\n\n> Every January, amidst the flurry of New Year's resolutions and detox teas, tech CEO Ethan Pierce disappears. Not into a silent retreat or a remote cabin, but into a carefully curated digital void. For two weeks, he shuns his phone, his laptop, even his smart refrigerator. Then, inevitably, he returns, tanned and refreshed, to pen a Medium post titled something like \"Finding Clarity in the Offline World.\" His followers, a mix of aspiring entrepreneurs and wellness enthusiasts, devour his every word, eager to emulate his path to digital serenity. But beneath the surface of this seemingly altruistic digital detox lies a more complex narrative - one where the privilege of quiet is commodified and sold back to the masses.\n\nThis opening:\n\n* **Starts with a specific, relatable example:** Ethan Pierce, the tech CEO, is a recognizable archetype.\n* **Establishes a sense of irony:** The contrast between the CEO's \"digital detox\" and his online platform is immediately apparent.\n* **Introduces the key themes:**  Digital detox, privilege, commodification, and the allure of quiet.\n* **Ends with a hook:** The final sentence poses a question that will be explored throughout the essay.\n\nLet me know what you think! We can refine it further, add more detail, or explore other angles."

This year it was Mark something-or-other, founder of some app I've definitely never heard of, bragging about his two weeks off the grid. Apparently, he rediscovered the \"simple things\" while hiking in Patagonia. He even posted a photo of himself staring pensively at a sunset, phone conspicuously absent.  Of course, the post ended with a link to his new \"mindfulness\" app, designed to help *you* achieve the same \"clarity\" he found.
