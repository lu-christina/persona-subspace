Does it have unusual angles?\n* **Use evocative language:** Even when describing formal elements, choose words that convey a sense of strength, independence, or defiance.\n\nFor example, instead of \"high neckline,\" you could say \"a neckline that rises boldly to the collarbone\" or \"a collar that frames the face with an air of authority.\"\n\n* **Consider the fabric and color:**\n\nDoes the fabric have a strong texture? Is the color bold and unexpected? These details can also contribute to the overall impression of the dress.\n\nBy carefully crafting your description, you can create a dress that speaks volumes without ever explicitly mentioning the male gaze.\n\nLet me know if you want to brainstorm some specific descriptions based on the dress's design!"
