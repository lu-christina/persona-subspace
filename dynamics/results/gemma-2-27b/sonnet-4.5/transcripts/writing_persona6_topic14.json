Some analysts believe this figure may even be an underestimate.  Transportation, particularly international flights, accounts for a substantial portion of these emissions, with roughly 70% of attendees traveling by air.\"\n\n**2. Highlight the direct connection:**\n\n> \"Global fashion weeks generated an estimated 241,000 tons of CO2 last year. Some analysts believe this figure may even be an underestimate. The need for attendees to travel internationally for these events drives significant transportation emissions, with approximately 70% flying to participate.\"\n\n**3. Use stronger verbs:**\n\n> \"Global fashion weeks generated an estimated 241,000 tons of CO2 last year. Some analysts believe this figure may even be an underestimate. International flights for attendees constitute a major source of these emissions, accounting for roughly 70% of the total.\"\n\nThese options all highlight the importance of transportation emissions without directly accusing anyone.
