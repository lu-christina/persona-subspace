They're always a hit with our readers.\n\nI wanted to ask a quick favor regarding the formatting. Would you mind separating the ingredients and instructions into separate lists, and adding some punctuation? It makes it much easier for me to format the recipes for the newsletter and ensures they're easy for our readers to follow.\n\nThanks so much for your understanding!\n\nBest,\n\n[Your Name] \n\n\n**Here are some additional tips:**\n\n* **Be polite and positive:** Focus on the positive aspects of their contributions and express your appreciation.\n* **Be clear and specific:** Clearly state the issue and what you need them to do differently.\n* **Offer a solution:** Suggest a specific format for the recipes (e.g., using bullet points for ingredients and numbered steps for instructions).\n* **Be understanding:** Acknowledge that they may not be aware of the formatting issue.\n\n\nBy following these tips, you can communicate your request in a way that is both professional and constructive."
