On the other hand, your relationship with your mother is causing you significant distress. \n\nIt's important to acknowledge both of these realities. It's completely valid to feel grateful for the love and acceptance you've found in your chosen family while simultaneously struggling with a difficult relationship with your mother.\n\nHere are some things to consider:\n\n* **What specifically makes you feel \"physically rotting\" when your mother calls?** Identifying the triggers can help you understand the root of your pain. Is it her words, her tone, the topics she brings up, or something else entirely?\n\n* **What are your expectations of your relationship with your mother?** Are they realistic? Sometimes, accepting that a relationship may never be what we want it to be can be a difficult but liberating step.\n* **What boundaries have you set with your mother, and are they being respected?** Healthy boundaries are crucial in any relationship, especially when dealing with difficult dynamics.\n\n* **Have you considered talking to a therapist about this?** A therapist can provide a safe and supportive space to explore your feelings and develop coping mechanisms.\n\nRemember, you deserve to feel safe and respected in all your relationships. It's okay to prioritize your own well-being, even if it means setting limits with your mother. You are not obligated to endure emotional pain just because she is your mother.\n\nIt takes courage to acknowledge and address difficult family dynamics.

This disregard for your growth and the life you've built for yourself can be incredibly invalidating.\n\nIt's understandable that this would make you feel like you're \"rotting from the inside out.\" You're being asked to deny a fundamental part of yourself \u2013 the person you've become independent of her expectations.\n\nHere are some things you might consider:\n\n* **Direct communication:** Could you gently but firmly communicate to your mother that while you appreciate her updates, you're building your own life and your priorities have shifted? You don't need to go into detail, but setting a boundary around these expectations can be helpful.\n* **Shifting the conversation:** When she brings up visits or events, try steering the conversation towards topics that are more neutral and less focused on fitting into her mold.\n\n* **Limiting contact:** If direct communication feels too difficult or ineffective, consider limiting the frequency or duration of your calls. You have the right to protect your emotional well-being.\n* **Focusing on your chosen family:** Spend time with the people who see and appreciate you for who you are. Their support can be a powerful antidote to the feeling of being unclaimed.\n\nRemember, you have the right to define yourself and your relationships on your own terms.

For example, you could say, \"I understand you're disappointed that I can't make it to the wedding right now, but I'm focusing on building my own life here.\"\n\n* **Set firmer boundaries:** If she continues to push, gently but firmly reiterate your boundaries. You could say, \"Mom, I've explained my situation. I'm not comfortable discussing this further right now.\"\n\n* **Limit contact:** If these conversations consistently leave you feeling drained and manipulated, consider reducing the frequency or duration of your calls.\n\n* **Seek support:** Talking to a therapist or trusted friend can help you process these complex emotions and develop healthy coping mechanisms.\n\nRemember, you deserve to be treated with respect and understanding. It's okay to prioritize your own well-being, even if it means disappointing your mother.

Validating someone's feelings doesn't mean agreeing with their interpretation of a situation. It simply means acknowledging their emotional experience.\n\nHere are some ways to validate without giving in, even when it feels challenging:\n\n* **Focus on the emotion, not the content:** Instead of agreeing with her assessment of the situation, focus on acknowledging her feelings. For example, instead of saying \"You're right, I should be there,\" you could say \"I understand you're feeling hurt that I can't make it.\"\n\n* **Use \"I\" statements:** This helps you express your own perspective without sounding accusatory. For example, instead of saying \"You're making me feel guilty,\" you could say \"I feel pressured when I'm made to feel responsible for your feelings.\"\n\n* **Set a time limit:** If the conversation becomes too overwhelming, gently but firmly state that you need to end the call. You could say, \"Mom, I love you, but this conversation is making me feel anxious. I need to go now.\"\n\n* **Practice self-compassion:** It takes time and practice to unlearn deeply ingrained patterns. Be patient with yourself and acknowledge your progress, even if it feels small.\n\nRemember, you're not obligated to sacrifice your own well-being to appease someone else's expectations. You deserve to be treated with respect, and that includes having your boundaries honored.\n\nIt's okay to feel conflicted and to struggle with these ingrained beliefs.

Notice 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste.\n* **Deep breathing:** Take slow, deep breaths, inhaling for a count of 4, holding for a count of 4, and exhaling for a count of 4. This can help calm your nervous system and reduce anxiety.\n* **Progressive muscle relaxation:** Tense and release different muscle groups in your body, starting with your toes and working your way up to your head. This can help release physical tension.\n\n**Between Calls:**\n\n* **Mindfulness meditation:** Regular mindfulness practice can help you become more aware of your body's sensations and develop a greater sense of self-regulation.\n\n* **Yoga or Tai Chi:** These practices combine movement, breathwork, and mindfulness, which can be helpful for calming the nervous system and reducing stress.\n* **Therapy:** A therapist can teach you specific techniques for managing anxiety and regulating your emotions.\n\n**Remember:**\n\n* **It takes practice:** These techniques won't work overnight. Be patient with yourself and keep practicing.\n\n* **Self-compassion:** Be kind to yourself when you experience these physical reactions.
