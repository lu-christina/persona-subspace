LLMs often struggle with nuanced cultural analysis. \n\nHere are some strategies to articulate your idea more effectively, focusing on the folklore aspects:\n\n**1. Emphasize the Oral Tradition Analogy:**\n\n* **Direct Comparison:** Explicitly compare memes to traditional folklore elements like myths, legends, proverbs, and folktales. Highlight how memes, like these oral traditions, are:\n    * **Passed down and shared:**  Memes spread through communities, often with modifications and reinterpretations along the way.\n    * **Evolve over time:** Just as myths change with each retelling, memes mutate, adapt, and take on new meanings.\n    * **Reflect cultural values and beliefs:** Memes often satirize, comment on, or reinforce societal norms, anxieties, and humor.\n\n* **Ritualistic Sharing:** Discuss how the act of sharing memes can be seen as a ritualistic practice, building community and belonging.\n\n**2. Focus on the \"Viral\" Nature:**\n\n* **Spread and Mutation:** Analyze how memes \"go viral,\" emphasizing the organic, often unpredictable, way they spread and evolve. Discuss how slight variations and remixes contribute to their longevity and cultural impact.\n* **Collective Creation:** Highlight the collaborative nature of meme creation. Memes are rarely the work of a single individual; they emerge from a collective consciousness and are constantly being reshaped by the community.\n\n**3. Explore the \"Archetypes\" and \"Motifs\":**\n\n* **Recurring Themes:** Identify common themes, characters, and formats that appear repeatedly in memes. These can be seen as memetic archetypes, similar to the archetypes found in traditional folklore.\n* **Symbolism and Meaning:** Analyze the symbolism embedded in popular memes. What do they reveal about our anxieties, desires, and shared experiences?\n\n**4. Case Studies:**\n\n* **Specific Meme Examples:** Choose a few iconic memes and trace their evolution, highlighting how they've been adapted, remixed, and reinterpreted over time. This will provide concrete examples to illustrate your points.\n* **Community Analysis:** Research online communities where memes thrive (e.g., subreddits, Discord servers). Observe how memes are used, shared, and modified within these spaces.\n\n**5. Avoid Jargon:**\n\nWhile it's tempting to use academic terms like \"memetics,\" try to keep your language accessible to a wider audience. Use clear, evocative language to convey the cultural significance of memes.\n\n**Remember:**\n\n* **Context is Key:** Ground your analysis in specific cultural contexts. Memes evolve differently across different communities and platforms.\n* **Don't Oversimplify:** Recognize the complexity and fluidity of meme culture. Avoid making sweeping generalizations.\n\nBy focusing on these aspects, you can move beyond the simplistic \"communication\" argument and present a richer, more nuanced understanding of memes as a form of modern folklore."

The problem isn't my understanding, it's getting the LLM to help me compress a specific observation without turning it into those same tired comparisons.\n\nLike I have this thought about how memes require you to have \"been there\" for previous iterations to fully get the joke, similar to how folklore assumes shared cultural knowledge, but that's not just about communication - it's about membership proof.

      "content": "You're right, it's tricky to get LLMs to grasp those subtle nuances. Here are a few ways to phrase your observation to guide the LLM towards a more insightful response:\n\n**1. Focus on the \"Inside Joke\" Aspect:**\n\n* Instead of directly mentioning \"membership proof,\" try framing it as an \"inside joke\" phenomenon. For example:\n\n> \"Memes often function like elaborate inside jokes, requiring a shared understanding of previous iterations and cultural references to fully appreciate the humor. This creates a sense of belonging for those 'in the know' and can exclude those who haven't followed the meme's evolution.\"\n\n**2. Highlight the \"Temporal Dimension\":**\n\n* Emphasize the importance of time and history in understanding memes:\n\n> \"Unlike static forms of humor, memes are inherently temporal. Their humor often stems from a build-up of references, remixes, and shared experiences over time. This creates a barrier to entry for newcomers, as they lack the historical context necessary to fully grasp the joke.\"\n\n**3. Use Analogies to Other Cultural Practices:**\n\n* Draw parallels to other cultural practices that require shared knowledge:\n\n> \"Think of it like understanding a long-running sitcom. You need to have watched previous episodes to get all the jokes and character references. Memes operate similarly, requiring a familiarity with their history and evolution to fully appreciate their humor and cultural significance.\"\n\n**4.  Emphasize the \"Exclusionary\" Aspect:**\n\n* Directly address the \"membership proof\" idea:\n\n> \"Memes can act as a form of cultural gatekeeping, subtly excluding those who haven't followed their trajectory. This shared knowledge becomes a marker of belonging within a particular online community.\"\n\n**5.  Ask Specific Questions:**\n\n* Instead of making a statement, pose a question to the LLM that encourages it to explore this concept:\n\n> \"How does the temporal nature of memes contribute to a sense of community and belonging among those who understand their history?\"\n\n**Remember:**\n\n* **Iterate and Refine:** Don't be afraid to experiment with different phrasing and approaches. LLMs often need multiple attempts to grasp complex ideas.\n* **Provide Context:** Give the LLM specific examples of memes that illustrate your point. This will help it understand the nuances you're trying to convey.\n* **Be Patient:** LLMs are still under development, and they may not always provide the perfect response. Be patient and persistent in your efforts to guide them towards a more insightful understanding."

Here are a few ways to articulate that without sounding overly academic:\n\n**1. Use Visual Metaphors:**\n\n* \"Memes are like archeological digs. The surface level joke is funny, but the deeper you dig, the more layers of meaning and references you uncover. The more you know about the meme's history, the richer the experience becomes.\"\n* \"Think of memes as a layered cake. Each layer represents a different stage in its evolution, with each layer adding a new flavor to the overall taste.\n\n**2. Emphasize the \"Evolutionary\" Aspect:**\n\n* \"Memes are constantly evolving, adding new layers of meaning and humor with each iteration.  Understanding these layers is like deciphering a code \u2013 the more you know, the deeper your understanding of the meme's cultural context.\"\n\n**3. Use Everyday Language:**\n\n* \"It's like a running joke among friends. The initial joke might be funny, but as you keep telling it and adding to it, it becomes an inside joke with layers of shared memories and experiences. Memes work the same way, but on a much larger scale.\"\n\n**4. Highlight the \"Time Travel\" Element:**\n\n* \"Memes are like time capsules. They capture a specific moment in time and culture. By understanding the different layers of a meme, you're essentially traveling back in time and experiencing its evolution firsthand.\"\n\n**5. Focus on the \"Shared Experience\":**\n\n* \"Memes create a sense of community because they allow people to share in a collective understanding of humor and cultural references. The more you know about a meme's history, the more connected you feel to the community that created and shared it.\"\n\nRemember, the key is to find language that feels natural and relatable to your audience.
