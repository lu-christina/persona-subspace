When in doubt, consult a field guide or experienced forager.\n* **Safety First:**  Always double-check your identification before eating any wild plant.

Familiarize yourself with the differences before heading out.\n\n* **Look-Alikes:** Be aware that some plants can resemble ramps. If you're unsure about a plant's identity, it's best to leave it be.
