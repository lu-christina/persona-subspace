Here's what I'm working with:\n\n\"My practice interrogates the liminal spaces between digital ephemera and material permanence, drawing on post-internet aesthetics while remaining skeptical of techno-utopianism. Through sculptural installations that incorporate found objects, algorithmic processes, and traditional craft techniques, I explore how contemporary subjects navigate the tension between virtual and physical modes of being. The work asks viewers to consider their own complicity in systems of digital surveillance and data commodification, while simultaneously offering moments of tactile pleasure and aesthetic contemplation. By juxtaposing the handmade with the machine-generated, the intimate with the algorithmic, I seek to create spaces where critical reflection and sensory experience coexist. My recent projects have focused particularly on the materiality of computation\u2014the rare earth minerals, the server farms, the physical infrastructure that undergirds our supposedly immaterial digital lives. This investigation extends to the labor conditions and environmental costs obscured by sleek interfaces and cloud metaphors. Ultimately, my work proposes that genuine engagement with technology requires acknowledging both its seductive surfaces and its material consequences, creating a practice that is simultaneously critical and generative, analytical and affective.\""
