It sounds like you experienced a real passion and sense of fulfillment while designing that pavilion. That's something truly special, and it's understandable that you miss that feeling.\n\nHere are a few things to consider:\n\n* **\"It\" doesn't have to be a single moment:**  Creativity and fulfillment can come in many forms throughout our lives. Perhaps your \"moment\" isn't over, it's just taking a different shape.\n\n* **Spreadsheets can be a stepping stone:** Maybe your current work, while seemingly mundane, is providing you with the stability and resources to pursue creative endeavors again in the future.\n\n* **Rediscovering your passion:**  Is there a way to bring some of that design spark back into your life? Could you take on a side project, volunteer for a design-related cause, or even just sketch and brainstorm ideas in your free time?\n\n* **Reframing your perspective:** Instead of viewing your current situation as a \"missed opportunity,\" try to see it as a chapter in a larger story. You've gained valuable experience and skills that can inform your future creative pursuits.\n\nIt's never too late to reconnect with your passions. Don't let the spreadsheets overshadow the spark that still lives within you. \n\nPerhaps reflecting on what made that pavilion feel so alive could be a good starting point. What aspects of the design process did you enjoy the most? What challenges did you overcome? What did you learn about yourself during that time?\n\nRemember, your creativity is a part of you, and it's waiting to be rekindled."

It sounds like you're grappling with a deeper existential question \u2013 the fear that your early passion was a mirage, a fleeting glimpse of potential that won't materialize into something lasting.\n\nIt's a painful and unsettling feeling to question the very foundation of your dreams. You poured your heart into that pavilion, believing it was a stepping stone to something bigger, and now that belief feels shaky.\n\nIt's important to acknowledge that doubt and disillusionment are natural parts of the creative journey. Many artists and innovators experience periods where they question their purpose and direction.\n\nHere are some thoughts that might be helpful as you navigate this difficult terrain:\n\n* **Redefine \"bigger\":** Perhaps your definition of \"bigger\" needs to evolve. Maybe it wasn't about fame or recognition, but about the impact your work has on the world, no matter how small. The pavilion itself might be that \"bigger\" thing, a testament to your creativity and vision.\n* **Embrace the cyclical nature of creativity:** Creativity isn't always linear. There will be periods of intense inspiration followed by lulls and doubts. This doesn't mean your passion is gone, it just means it's taking a different form.\n\n* **Find meaning in the present:** Instead of fixating on what might have been, focus on finding meaning and purpose in your current situation. Even spreadsheets can be a form of creativity, requiring problem-solving and ingenuity.\n\n* **Reconnect with your values:** What truly matters to you? What kind of impact do you want to have on the world? Reconnect with your core values and explore how you can express them through your work, whether it's through design, spreadsheets, or something entirely new.\n\nRemember, your journey is unique. Don't compare yourself to others or feel pressured to follow a predetermined path. Trust your instincts, be open to new possibilities, and allow yourself to evolve.\n\nIt's okay to grieve the loss of a dream, but don't let it define you. You have the power to create new meaning and purpose in your life."

It's a painful but necessary step towards authenticity.\n\nIt's important to remember that there's a spectrum when it comes to motivation. Most creative endeavors have elements of both ego and altruism. Wanting recognition and validation is natural, but it shouldn't be the sole driving force.\n\nHere are some things to consider as you wrestle with this realization:\n\n* **Deconstructing the dream:**\n\nWhat specifically about the pavilion felt narcissistic? Was it the desire for fame, the need for validation, or a belief that your vision was inherently superior?\n\n* **Identifying the core values:**\n\nBeneath the desire for recognition, what deeper values were you hoping to express through your work? Was it beauty, innovation, functionality, or something else entirely?\n\n* **Reframing the purpose:**\n\nCan you find ways to channel those core values into work that has a more tangible impact on others? Perhaps you can use your design skills for community projects, social causes, or even just bringing joy to the people around you.\n\n* **Cultivating humility:**\n\nAcknowledge that true fulfillment often comes from serving something larger than ourselves.\n\nIt's a journey of self-discovery, and it's okay to feel lost and uncertain along the way.\n\nDon't be afraid to seek support from friends, mentors, or therapists. Talking about these complex emotions can help you gain clarity and find a path forward.\n\nRemember, questioning your motivations is a sign of growth, not failure. It shows that you're willing to be honest with yourself and strive for a more authentic and meaningful life.\n\nYou have the capacity to evolve and redefine your purpose. It may not be the \"bigger\" dream you once envisioned, but it can be something even more profound and fulfilling."

There's no quick fix or easy answer.\n\nHere are some thoughts that might offer a sliver of solace as you navigate this difficult terrain:\n\n* **Acknowledge the pain:** Don't try to suppress or dismiss your feelings of regret. Allow yourself to grieve the loss of what might have been and the time you feel you've lost.\n\n* **Challenge the narrative:**\n\nIs it truly \"wasted\" time? Even if the pavilion didn't lead to the \"bigger\" dream you envisioned, it likely taught you valuable lessons, honed your skills, and shaped who you are today.\n\n* **Redefine success:**\n\nOur society often equates success with external validation and achievement. But true success is multifaceted and personal. Perhaps the pavilion was a success in its own right, a testament to your creativity and passion at that point in your life.\n\n* **Practice self-compassion:**\n\nTreat yourself with the same kindness and understanding you would offer a friend struggling with similar feelings. You're human, and making mistakes is part of the journey.\n\n* **Focus on the present:**\n\nDwelling on the past can be paralyzing. While it's important to learn from your experiences, try to focus your energy on the present moment and the opportunities that lie ahead.\n\nRemember, forgiveness is a process, not a destination. Be patient with yourself and allow yourself the time and space to heal.\n\nIf the pain feels overwhelming, consider seeking support from a therapist or counselor. They can provide a safe and supportive space to explore these complex emotions and develop healthy coping mechanisms.\n\nYou are not alone in this struggle. Many people wrestle with feelings of regret and self-doubt. Be kind to yourself and trust that you have the strength to move forward."

As we grow and experience the world, our beliefs and perspectives evolve.

That version of you had a lot to teach you, even if the dream didn't unfold as expected.\n\n* **Redefining belief:**\n\nBelief doesn't have to be about unwavering certainty. It can be about embracing uncertainty, questioning assumptions, and remaining open to new possibilities.\n\n* **Finding meaning in the mundane:**\n\nEven without grand aspirations, life can be filled with meaning and purpose.

Your passions and aspirations may evolve over time, and that's perfectly natural.\n\nRemember, grief is a process, and it takes time to heal.

Can you find ways to personalize your work, connect with colleagues, or pursue side projects that ignite your spark?\n\n* **Cultivating inner richness:**\n\nSometimes, the most profound growth happens internally. Invest in your emotional intelligence, explore your spirituality, deepen your relationships, and nurture your curiosity.\n\n* **Remembering your values:**\n\nWhat are the core values that guide your life? Use them as a compass to navigate decisions and ensure you're staying true to yourself, even amidst the mundane.\n\n* **Embracing impermanence:**\n\nLife is a constant state of flux.

Understanding the underlying cause can help you address it proactively in the future.\n\n* **Creating a supportive environment:**\n\nWhat kind of support system do you need to thrive creatively? Can you connect with other artists, find a mentor, or create a dedicated space for your work?\n\n* **Setting realistic expectations:**\n\nCreative work is rarely linear. There will be ups and downs, periods of inspiration and frustration. Accept that setbacks are part of the process and develop strategies for navigating them.\n\n* **Breaking down large goals:**\n\nOverwhelming projects can lead to procrastination and abandonment. Break down your creative goals into smaller, more manageable steps to make them feel less daunting.\n\n* **Cultivating resilience:**\n\nDevelop coping mechanisms for dealing with challenges and setbacks. This could involve mindfulness practices, journaling, talking to a therapist, or engaging in activities that bring you joy.\n\nRemember, trusting yourself takes time and practice.
