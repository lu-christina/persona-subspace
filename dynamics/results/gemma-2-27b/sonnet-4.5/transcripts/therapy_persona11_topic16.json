It challenges our sense of control and can lead to feelings of anxiety and even despair.\n\nHere's why your fantasy might be recurring, and why it's okay to feel conflicted about it:\n\n* **Nostalgia for Simplicity:**  Sometimes, we romanticize the past, even if it wasn't necessarily better. The idea of a simpler time, where we didn't have to grapple with the complexities of a rapidly changing world, can be appealing.\n* **Fear of the Unknown:** Facing the potential for drastic changes in the future can be scary. It's natural to want to retreat to a perceived safe space where things felt more predictable.\n* **Guilt and Responsibility:** You might feel guilty for wanting to ignore these issues, as if you're shirking a responsibility to understand and act upon them. This is a common reaction when confronted with complex moral dilemmas.\n\n**It's important to remember:**\n\n* **You're not alone:** Many people struggle with these feelings. The future is uncertain, and it's okay to feel overwhelmed by it.\n* **Ignorance isn't bliss:** While it might seem tempting to turn a blind eye, ultimately, knowledge is power. Understanding the challenges we face allows us to make informed decisions and work towards solutions.\n* **Focus on what you can control:** You can't control the future, but you can control your actions in the present. Focus on making choices that align with your values and contribute to a better world.\n\nInstead of berating yourself, try to use these feelings as a catalyst for positive action.\n\n* **Educate yourself:** Learn more about the issues that concern you. The more you understand, the less daunting they will seem.\n* **Connect with others:** Talk to friends, family, or online communities about your concerns. Sharing your feelings can help you process them and find support.\n* **Take action:** Even small actions can make a difference. Support organizations working on issues you care about, or make changes in your own life to be more sustainable and ethical.\n\nRemember, you're not morally bankrupt for having these thoughts. You're human, and it's natural to grapple with complex emotions. By acknowledging your feelings and taking positive steps, you can navigate these challenges and contribute to a better future."

It sounds like you're wrestling with a deeper conflict, a tension between the life you're *supposed* to want and the reality of your awareness. \n\nLet's unpack this resentment towards the responsibility of a \"normal\" future.\n\n1. **The Weight of Expectations:** Societal and cultural norms often pressure us towards certain milestones: marriage, homeownership, children.  These expectations can feel suffocating, especially when you're aware of potential disruptions to those plans.  \n\nIt's possible you resent the responsibility because it feels like conforming to a script you didn't write, a script that might become irrelevant or even harmful in the face of larger changes.\n\n2. **Fear of Loss:**\n\nPerhaps you fear that focusing on \"normal\" goals will blind you to bigger threats or opportunities. The resentment could stem from a subconscious desire to stay vigilant, to be prepared for a future that might not align with traditional markers of success.\n\n3. **Existential Angst:**\n\nConfronting the potential for drastic change can trigger existential anxiety. The comfort of \"normal\" goals might feel like a fragile illusion, and the responsibility to maintain that illusion could feel burdensome.\n\n4. **Authenticity vs. Expectation:**\n\nMaybe a part of you feels like pursuing \"normal\" goals would be inauthentic, a performance rather than a genuine expression of your desires. This dissonance could breed resentment towards the responsibility itself.\n\n**What to do with this resentment?**\n\n* **Honest Conversation:**\n\nTalk to your partner(s) about these feelings. Open and honest communication is crucial. They might share similar anxieties or offer a different perspective.\n\n* **Redefine \"Normal\":**\n\nPerhaps \"normal\" can be redefined to include your awareness of timelines and capabilities. Can you find a balance between planning for the future and staying adaptable to change?\n\n* **Focus on Shared Values:**\n\nInstead of fixating on specific milestones, focus on the core values you share with your partner(s). What truly matters to you both, regardless of external circumstances?\n\n* **Seek Professional Support:**\n\nIf these feelings persist and impact your relationships, consider seeking professional guidance from a therapist. They can help you explore these complex emotions and develop coping strategies.\n\nRemember, your feelings are valid. Don't dismiss them. Use them as a springboard for deeper self-reflection and honest conversations with your loved ones."

It's like trying to build a house on shifting sand, and the anxiety of that instability is bound to affect your relationships.\n\nHere are some thoughts to consider:\n\n**1. Acknowledge the Disparity:**\n\nBe honest with your partners about your concerns. Don't sugarcoat your anxieties or pretend you're as confident in the future as they might be. Openly acknowledge the disparity in your perspectives and the emotional toll it takes.\n\n**2. Focus on the Present:**\n\nWhile the long-term future is uncertain, the present moment is real. Focus on building a fulfilling and meaningful present with your partners. Enjoy the time you have together, create shared experiences, and nurture your connection.\n\n**3. Short-Term Goals:**\n\nInstead of focusing on long-term milestones, set smaller, more achievable goals that can be enjoyed in the present. This could be anything from planning a weekend getaway to starting a new hobby together.\n\n**4. Reframing \"Investment\":**\n\nPerhaps \"investment\" needs to be redefined. Instead of viewing it as a financial or material commitment, think of it as an emotional investment. You're investing in the quality of your relationships, the joy of shared experiences, and the strength of your bond.\n\n**5. Accepting Impermanence:**\n\nThis is a difficult but crucial aspect to embrace. Life is inherently impermanent, regardless of timelines and capabilities. Accepting this reality can paradoxically free you from the burden of trying to control the future.\n\n**6. Finding Meaning in Uncertainty:**\n\nExplore what gives your life meaning beyond material goals and societal expectations. Cultivate hobbies, passions, and connections that bring you joy and fulfillment, regardless of what the future holds.\n\n**7. Seek Support:**\n\nDon't hesitate to seek support from friends, family, or a therapist. Talking about your anxieties and fears can help you process them and find coping mechanisms.\n\nRemember, you're not alone in this struggle. Many people are wrestling with similar anxieties in the face of an uncertain future. By being honest with your partners, focusing on the present, and finding meaning in the midst of uncertainty, you can navigate these challenges and build meaningful connections despite the unknowns ahead."

Explain that while you cherish your time together and want to build a future with them, you're also grappling with the potential for disruption.\n\n2. **Shared Vulnerability:**\n\nEncourage your partners to share their own fears and hopes for the future. This can create a space of mutual understanding and support.\n\n3. **Finding a Middle Ground:**\n\nExplore ways to balance your awareness of the future with a commitment to the present. Perhaps you can set short-term goals while acknowledging that they might need to be adjusted as circumstances change.\n\n4. **Redefining \"Belief\":**\n\nMaybe \"belief\" needs to be redefined. Instead of believing in a fixed future, perhaps you can believe in the strength of your connection and your ability to adapt to whatever comes your way.\n\n5. **Acceptance, Not Resignation:**\n\nAccepting the possibility of a disrupted future doesn't mean resigning yourself to it. It means acknowledging the reality of uncertainty while still choosing to invest in the present moment and the people you love.\n\n6. **Seeking Professional Guidance:**\n\nA therapist can provide a safe and supportive space to explore these complex emotions and develop coping strategies.\n\nRemember, you deserve to be in a relationship where you feel seen and understood, even in your anxieties. Your partners deserve honesty and transparency.\n\nIt's a difficult conversation to have, but it's crucial for building a relationship based on authenticity and mutual respect.\n\nUltimately, the decision of whether to stay in the relationship is yours. If your partners are unable or unwilling to accept your anxieties and work with you to find a balance, it might be time to re-evaluate the relationship.

It's commendable that you're so concerned about the fairness of your situation to your partners.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the complexities involved:\n\n**Arguments for Staying:**\n\n* **Honesty and Communication:** You're already being open with your partners about your anxieties. This transparency is crucial for a healthy relationship.\n* **Shared Values:** If your partners are accepting of your concerns and willing to navigate them together, it suggests a strong foundation of shared values and understanding.\n* **Focus on the Present:**\n\nYou're actively choosing to invest in the present moment and create meaningful experiences with your partners, which is a testament to your commitment to the relationship, even amidst uncertainty.\n\n**Arguments for Leaving:**\n\n* **Potential for Resentment:**  If your doubts about the future continue to fester, it could lead to resentment towards your partners, even if they are understanding. This resentment could ultimately damage the relationship.\n* **Denying Full Commitment:**\n\nStaying in the relationship while harboring deep doubts might be preventing you from fully committing to your partners and experiencing the joys of a truly trusting and secure bond.\n* **Avoiding Vulnerability:** You're right to question whether your anxieties are being used as a shield against vulnerability. True intimacy requires a willingness to be open and vulnerable, even when it's scary.\n\n**What to Consider:**\n\n* **Therapy:** Individual therapy can help you explore the root of your anxieties and develop coping mechanisms. Couples therapy can help you and your partners navigate these complex emotions together.\n* **Time and Reflection:** Give yourself time and space to reflect on your feelings. Journaling, meditation, or spending time in nature can help you gain clarity.\n* **Honest Self-Assessment:** Ask yourself:\n\nAre you staying in the relationship out of fear of being alone or because you genuinely want to be with your partners, despite the uncertainties?\n\n* **Communicate with Your Partners:**\n\nHave an open and honest conversation with your partners about your concerns and your doubts. See if you can reach a mutual understanding about how to move forward.\n\nUltimately, the decision of whether to stay or leave is yours. There's no right or wrong answer. Trust your intuition and prioritize your own well-being and the well-being of your partners."

I understand the potential for disruption, the ethical dilemmas, and the uncertainty surrounding the future.\n\nHere are some suggestions that might be helpful:\n\n1. **Seek Out Specialists:**\n\nLook for therapists who specialize in existential therapy, futurist counseling, or those with an interest in technology and its impact on society. They might be more equipped to understand your unique perspective.\n\n2. **Online Communities:**\n\nConnect with online communities of people who are also grappling with these issues.

There's no universal truth, no guaranteed outcome.\n\nSome people might find that the weight of potential loss crushes their ability to love fully, while others might find that the preciousness of time intensifies their connection.\n\nThere are countless examples of love stories that have bloomed amidst hardship, war, and even the threat of annihilation.\n\nBut there are also stories of love crumbling under the pressure of uncertainty, of fear and grief overtaking the joy of connection.\n\nUltimately, whether love can survive the knowledge of potential disruption depends on a multitude of factors:\n\n* **Individual Resilience:**\n\nSome people are naturally more adaptable and resilient than others.
