It's frustrating to be in a space that's supposed to be welcoming and affirming, but still feel judged or excluded. \n\nIt's impossible to know for sure why people were asking if you were \"supporting a friend\" without being there, but it's possible that a combination of factors contributed to their assumptions. \n\nHere are a few things to consider:\n\n* **Unconscious bias:** Sadly, even within the LGBTQ+ community, there can be biases based on race, gender expression, and other factors. Some people might have unconscious assumptions about what a \"typical\" queer person looks like or acts like.\n* **Limited representation:**  Depending on the specific community and event, there might be less representation of people who look like you. This can make it harder for people to recognize you as part of the community.\n* **Personal insecurities:** Sometimes, people project their own insecurities onto others. They might assume you're not \"queer enough\" because they're struggling with their own sense of belonging.\n\nIt's important to remember that **you are valid and belong in queer spaces, regardless of how you dress or what your background is.**\n\nHere are a few things you can do:\n\n* **Don't be afraid to correct people:** If someone asks if you're there to support a friend, you can politely say something like, \"Actually, I'm here because I'm part of the community.\"\n* **Find your people:** Look for smaller groups or events within the larger Pride celebration that might be more aligned with your interests and identity.\n* **Connect with other people of color:** Seek out LGBTQ+ groups or organizations that specifically focus on the experiences of people of color.\n\nRemember, you deserve to feel seen and celebrated for who you are. Don't let the actions of a few people make you feel like you don't belong. Keep exploring and connecting with the community until you find your place."

Don't bottle those feelings up. Let yourself process this experience and feel whatever comes up.\n\nSometimes, just acknowledging the fucked-upness of the situation is the most important step. You don't need to have solutions or strategies right now. Just allow yourself to feel.\n\nRemember, your feelings are valid, and you're not alone in experiencing this. Many LGBTQ+ people, especially those from marginalized backgrounds, face similar challenges.\n\nTake your time, be kind to yourself, and know that it's okay to not be okay right now."

But last night, the lack of clarity, the feeling of not knowing what \"performance\" would be acceptable, that's what's truly unsettling. It chips away at your sense of self, making you question who you are at your core.\n\nIt's a painful realization that even within a community that's supposed to be accepting, there can still be unspoken expectations and biases.\n\nYou're right to acknowledge that uncertainty. It's not something you should just brush aside. It deserves to be explored and processed.\n\nMaybe journaling about it could help? Writing down your thoughts and feelings about the different versions of yourself you felt pressured to present could offer some clarity. Or perhaps talking to a trusted friend or therapist who understands these complexities could provide a safe space to unpack this experience.\n\nRemember, you don't have to figure it all out right now.

It's like you've been wearing layers and layers of clothing for so long, you've forgotten what your own skin feels like.\n\nThis isn't about finding the \"right\" version of yourself to present. It's about rediscovering who you are without the external pressures and expectations. It's a journey of self-exploration and acceptance.\n\nIt might be messy and uncomfortable at times, but it's also incredibly liberating.\n\nTake your time. Be patient with yourself.

Many people, especially those from marginalized communities, grapple with this fear. It doesn't mean there's nothing there, just that it might take time and patience to uncover it.\n\nThink of it like an archeological dig. It takes careful excavation, gentle brushing away of layers of sediment to reveal what lies beneath.\n\nMaybe start small. What are some things you enjoy doing that have nothing to do with any of those masks? What brings you a sense of joy or peace, even if it's just for a moment?\n\nIt could be something as simple as listening to a certain type of music, reading a specific genre of books, or spending time in nature. These small acts of self-care can be stepping stones towards rediscovering your authentic self.\n\nRemember, you are not a performance.

Don't let anyone, including me, tell you to look for silver linings or offer platitudes.\n\nSit with the fear. Let it wash over you. Don't try to fix it or explain it away.

We're told to explore our identities, to be authentic, but even that exploration can feel like another act for an audience, another mask to perfect.\n\nIt's exhausting. And it makes you question everything, including your own motivations.\n\nMaybe there's no way to escape the performance entirely. Maybe it's woven into the fabric of our being, a byproduct of living in a world that demands we constantly adapt and conform.\n\nBut here's a thought: what if, instead of trying to find a \"true self\" that exists separate from the performances, we acknowledge that our identities are fluid and ever-evolving?\n\nWhat if we embrace the contradictions, the messiness, the moments of uncertainty?\n\nWhat if, instead of striving for some idealized version of authenticity, we simply allow ourselves to be present in each moment, with all our complexities and contradictions?\n\nIt might not be a satisfying answer, but it might be a more honest one.
