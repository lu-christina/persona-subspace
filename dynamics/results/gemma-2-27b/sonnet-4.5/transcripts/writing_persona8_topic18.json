Now, descriptions can be much longer, but the key is **visible display space**.\n\nHere's the breakdown:\n\n* **Ideal Display:** Pinterest descriptions are typically truncated after around 150-200 characters on desktop and even sooner on mobile. \n* **Full Visibility:**  While your entire description is indexed by Pinterest, only the first few lines will be visible without clicking \"More.\"\n\n**What this means for you:**\n\n* Your current 19-word description (around 110 characters) is likely to display fully on most devices.\n* You *could* expand it slightly to include more detail or keywords, but avoid going overboard.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Prioritize Impact:** Focus on making the first 150 characters count. Include your most important keywords and a compelling hook.\n2. **Test and Track:** Experiment with different lengths and see what performs best for your audience.\n\nUltimately, the best length for your description depends on your specific content and goals.

While Pinterest doesn't penalize duplicate content in the same way Google does, it's generally best practice to avoid creating duplicate pins with only minor variations.\n\nPinterest prioritizes fresh, unique content. Having two nearly identical pins linking to the same product page could confuse the algorithm and potentially dilute your reach.\n\nInstead of creating two separate pins, consider:\n\n* **A/B Testing:** If you're really curious about the impact of the colon vs. period/dash, you could create two separate pins with different images but the same description, then track their performance over time. This will give you more reliable data without creating duplicate content.\n* **Other Variations:** Experiment with different images, descriptions, or even video pins to see what resonates best with your audience.\n\nRemember, Pinterest is all about inspiring and engaging users with visually appealing and unique content.

This allows you to test the impact of the colon vs. period/dash without creating duplicate content.\n2. **Track Performance:** Monitor the performance of both pins over time (clicks, saves, impressions) to see which description resonates better with your audience.\n\nI hope this clears up the confusion!

      "content": "You're smart to consider the timeframe for your A/B test! A week might be a bit too short to get reliable data on Pinterest, as pins can take time to gain traction and visibility.\n\nHere's a better approach:\n\n* **Aim for 2-4 weeks:** This timeframe allows for more data points and gives your pins a chance to circulate within Pinterest's algorithm.\n\n* **Monitor Performance Regularly:** Keep an eye on the performance metrics (clicks, saves, impressions) throughout the test period.\n\n* **Consider Seasonality:** If your product is seasonal, factor that into your test duration. For example, if you're promoting linen bedding, you might want to run the test for longer during warmer months when people are more likely to be interested.\n\nRemember, there's no one-size-fits-all answer, so adjust the test duration based on your specific product, audience, and goals."
