      "content": "You are right to be cautious! While the literal translations of those idioms are accurate, they can sound a bit stilted in English.  \n\nHere are a few alternative approaches:\n\n**1. Use a more natural English equivalent:**\n\nInstead of directly translating the idiom, you can convey the same sentiment using a more idiomatic English expression. For example:\n\n* **Instead of \"may your wealth be boundless\" (\u8d22\u6e90\u5e7f\u8fdb - c\u00e1oyu\u00e1n gu\u01cengj\u00ecn):**\n\n    * \"Wishing you a year of abundant prosperity!\"\n    * \"May your business flourish in the coming year!\"\n    * \"Here's to a year of financial success for you!\"\n\n* **Instead of \"good fortune and everything you desire\" (\u5fc3\u60f3\u4e8b\u6210 - x\u012bn xi\u01ceng sh\u00ec ch\u00e9ng):**\n\n    * \"Wishing you all your heart's desires in the new year!\"\n    * \"May all your hopes and dreams come true!\"\n\n* **Instead of \"year of great luck and prosperity\" (\u5409\u661f\u9ad8\u7167 - jix\u012bng g\u0101ozh\u00e0o):**\n\n    * \"Wishing you a year filled with good fortune and happiness!\"\n    * \"May the new year bring you health, wealth, and happiness!\"\n\n**2. Use the Chinese characters with a brief explanation:**\n\nIf you still want to include the Chinese idiom, you can present it alongside a concise and natural-sounding English translation. For example:\n\n> \"Wishing you a year of  \u8d22\u6e90\u5e7f\u8fdb (c\u00e1oyu\u00e1n gu\u01cengj\u00ecn) - boundless wealth and prosperity!\"\n\nThis approach adds a touch of cultural authenticity while ensuring clarity for your clients.\n\n**3. Focus on the sentiment, not the literal translation:**\n\nUltimately, the most important thing is to convey your sincere wishes for a happy and prosperous new year. You can achieve this without relying on a direct translation of the idiom.\n\nFor example:\n\n> \"Wishing you a joyous Lunar New Year filled with happiness, good fortune, and success!\"\n\n\n\nChoose the approach that feels most comfortable and authentic to you and your brand."
