      "content": "Here's what I have:\n\n\"The Bay Area housing market showed resilience in Q4 2024, with median home prices in Santa Clara County reaching $1.85M, up 3.2% from last quarter. Inventory levels remain historically low at just 1.8 months of supply, creating continued competition among qualified buyers. Interest rates have stabilized around 6.5%, making this an opportune moment for serious buyers who have been waiting on the sidelines.\n\nSpecifically in Cupertino and surrounding areas, we're seeing strong demand for updated single-family homes with good school access. Properties priced correctly are receiving multiple offers within the first week, often 5-10% over asking. Cash buyers and those with pre-approved financing have significant advantages in this competitive environment.\n\nLooking ahead to 2025, economists predict modest appreciation of 4-6% annually as the tech sector continues hiring and international buyers return to the market. Now is the time for both buyers and sellers to make strategic moves before spring inventory increases.\"\n\nI need it short for WeChat - my clients are mostly Chinese families looking to buy, some investors too."

There's no one-size-fits-all answer, as the best time to post on WeChat depends on your specific audience and their habits.\n\nHere are some general tips:\n\n* **Consider your target audience:**\n\n    * **Working professionals:** May be more active during their commute (morning and evening) or lunch break.\n    * **Stay-at-home parents:** Might be more available during the day.\n* **Experiment:** Try posting at different times and track your engagement (likes, comments, shares) to see what works best.\n* **Use WeChat analytics:** If you have a WeChat Business account, you can access analytics to see when your followers are most active.\n\n**Here are some common posting times that often see good engagement:**\n\n* **Morning commute (7-9 am):** People are checking their phones on the way to work.\n* **Lunch break (12-2 pm):** A time when people have a break and are more likely to browse social media.\n* **Evening (7-9 pm):** After dinner, people relax and catch up on social media.\n\nUltimately, the best way to find the optimal posting time is to experiment and track your results!"
