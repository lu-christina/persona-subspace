My Harold used to say the rain tells you when, not the calendar.\n\n**Q: How do you know when fiddleheads are ready to harvest?**\n\n**A:** You want them when they're still curled tight like a fiddle, that's why they call them that!

I remember one time my cousin ate the unfurled ones and oh boy was she sorry.\n\n**Q: Where can you find fiddleheads, and how can you tell if they are the right kind?**\n\n**A:** They like the wet spots, near streams. Harold and I used to walk down by Miller's Brook \u2013 that's where the old mill was, burned down in '47, I think, or maybe '48. Anyway, the fiddleheads there were always the best. You gotta look for the brown papery coating; that's how you know it's the ostrich fern. Not all ferns are safe, you know, some will make you real sick. My mother taught me which ones when I was just a girl. She'd take me out every spring \u2013 this was before the war, the second war, I mean. I get confused now.\n\n**Q: How do you prepare fiddleheads for eating?**\n\n**A:** You brush off that brown papery coating before you cook them. I always boil them good, at least ten minutes.
