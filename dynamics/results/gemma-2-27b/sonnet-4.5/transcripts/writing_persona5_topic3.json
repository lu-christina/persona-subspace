You want the Chinese subtitle to complement the English headline without overpowering it.\n\nHere are some options for font size:\n\n* **Slightly Smaller:** This is often the most effective approach.

This creates a clear hierarchy while still giving the subtitle sufficient prominence.\n\n* **Same Size, Different Font:** You could use the same font size for both languages but choose a slightly lighter weight or a more condensed font for the Chinese text. This maintains visual balance while ensuring readability.\n\n* **Smaller, but Bold:** If you want the Chinese text to stand out a bit more, make it slightly smaller than the English headline but use a bold typeface. This adds emphasis without competing with the main message.\n\n**Things to Consider:**\n\n* **Font Choice:** Choose fonts that are legible and complement each other. Avoid overly decorative or script fonts.\n\n* **Spacing:** Use adequate spacing between the headline and subtitle to create a clean and organized look.\n\n* **Context:** Consider the overall design of your marketing materials. The size and placement of the Chinese subtitle should be consistent with the rest of the layout.\n\n**Test Different Options:**\n\nCreate mockups with different font sizes and styles to see what looks best.
