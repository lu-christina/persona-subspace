The poem reads well with or without them.\n\nHere's how it would look with commas:\n\n\"In the meadow soft and round,\nwhite puffballs dot the ground,\nlike nature's own surprise,\nbeneath September skies,\nwhen pressed they breathe a cloud,\nof spores both soft and loud.\"\n\nUltimately, the decision of whether or not to use commas at the end of lines is up to the poet and what they feel best serves the poem."

They are a powerful tool in poetry, affecting pacing, emphasis, and the overall feeling of a piece.\n\nIn this case, keeping \"when pressed they breathe a cloud\" and \"of spores both soft and loud\" on separate lines emphasizes the action and its result. It creates a sense of anticipation and then a release, mirroring the puffball's action.\n\nHowever, if you wanted to create a smoother, more flowing effect, you could combine them:\n\n\"when pressed they breathe a cloud\nof spores both soft and loud\"\n\nUltimately, the best choice depends on the feeling you want to evoke.  \n\nThink about:\n\n* **Rhythm:** Do you want a more staccato or flowing rhythm?\n* **Emphasis:** What words or phrases do you want to highlight?\n* **Imagery:** How do the line breaks affect the visual representation of the poem on the page?\n\nExperiment with both options and see which one feels right for you!"

Where do you naturally want to take a breath or pause?\n\n2. **Consider the meaning:** Where are the natural shifts in thought or imagery?\n\n3. **Look for grammatical clues:** Are there phrases or clauses that naturally break up the lines?\n\n4. **Experiment:** Try different line breaks and see which ones feel most natural and enhance the poem's impact.\n\nRemember, there's no single \"right\" answer.

This helps to visually separate the lines and emphasize their individual impact.\n\nHowever, there's a growing trend in contemporary poetry to use lowercase for stylistic effect.

Consider:\n\n* **The overall tone and style of the newsletter:** Does it lean towards traditional or more modern aesthetics?\n* **The subscriber's intent:** If you're unsure, you could always reach out and ask them about their preference.\n\nEither way, be consistent with your choice throughout the poem."
