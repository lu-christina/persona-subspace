While periods can create a sense of finality, in this case, the consistent structure actually works in your favor. \n\nThink of it like a visual rhythm. The repetition of the \"Benefit. Trust Signal\" format creates a sense of cohesion and makes your brand messaging feel clear and memorable.\n\nPlus, short, punchy sentences are very on-trend for website banners.\n\nIf you're still concerned about repetition, you could experiment with using an em dash (\u2014) instead of a period for one of the banners to add a bit of visual variety.\n\nUltimately, the best way to decide is to test it out and see what looks best on your website!"
