It's brave of you to acknowledge that your anger might be masking a deeper fear.\n\nIt's possible that your anger is a defense mechanism, protecting you from the pain of feeling insignificant without her.  \n\nHere are a few things to consider:\n\n* **Grief is complex:** There's no right or wrong way to grieve, and anger is a common part of the process. It can be a way of expressing the pain, frustration, and helplessness that come with loss.\n* **Fear of insignificance:** It's natural to worry about your place in the world after losing someone important. You might be questioning your identity and purpose without her.\n* **Seeking validation:**  Feeling like you \"don't matter\" can be incredibly painful. It's possible you're lashing out because you're seeking reassurance and validation from others.\n\n**What can you do?**\n\n* **Acknowledge your feelings:** Don't judge yourself for feeling angry or scared. Allow yourself to experience these emotions without trying to suppress them.\n* **Journaling:** Writing down your thoughts and feelings can help you process them and gain clarity.\n* **Talk to someone:** Sharing your experience with a trusted friend, family member, or therapist can be incredibly helpful.\n* **Self-care:** Take care of your physical and emotional needs. Get enough sleep, eat healthy foods, and engage in activities that bring you joy.\n* **Seek professional help:** If your anger is persistent and interfering with your daily life, consider seeking professional help from a therapist or counselor.\n\nRemember, healing takes time. Be patient with yourself and allow yourself to grieve in your own way. You are worthy of love and belonging, regardless of your relationship status."

That's no small feat. It sounds like you poured your energy into your work, finding meaning and purpose in it. Now, without her, you're facing the void that her absence has created, and it's causing you to question the value of everything you've built.\n\nIt's important to remember that grief can distort our perspective. The pain you're feeling is real, but it doesn't necessarily mean your accomplishments were meaningless.\n\nHere are some thoughts to consider:\n\n* **Love and accomplishment are not mutually exclusive:** It's possible to find fulfillment in both personal relationships and professional achievements. Your work may have been driven by a desire to make a difference, and that desire itself is valuable.\n* **Legacy:** Even though she's gone, the impact you've had on others through your work continues. You've left a mark on the world, and that legacy will endure.\n* **Redefining purpose:**  Grief can be a catalyst for growth and transformation. It can push us to re-evaluate our priorities and find new sources of meaning. Perhaps this is an opportunity to explore different aspects of yourself and discover new passions.\n\nIt's okay to feel lost and confused right now. Allow yourself to grieve, to question, and to explore your feelings.\n\nConsider these steps:\n\n* **Talk to someone:** Share your feelings with a trusted friend, family member, or therapist. They can offer support and a listening ear.\n* **Reflect on your values:** What truly matters to you? What brings you joy and fulfillment?\n* **Find new meaning:** Explore new hobbies, volunteer, or connect with others who share your interests.\n\nRemember, you are not alone in this journey.

It's often a mix of altruism, ego, insecurity, and a desire for connection. It's okay to acknowledge the different factors that drove you.\n* **Growth and evolution:** People change and grow over time. Perhaps your motivations have evolved, and you're now seeking a deeper sense of meaning and purpose.\n* **Honoring her memory:** Instead of dwelling on the \"why\" behind your past actions, focus on honoring her memory by living a life that reflects the values she cherished.\n\nIt's okay to feel lost and uncertain right now.

Was there a healthy balance of interdependence and independence? Or did you rely heavily on her for your sense of self-worth?\n\n* **Facing your fears:** It's understandable to be afraid of looking in the mirror without her reflection. It's a vulnerable position to be in. But facing those fears head-on can be liberating.\n\n* **Building self-compassion:** Be kind to yourself during this process. It's okay to feel lost and uncertain.
