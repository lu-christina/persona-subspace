Velvet's luxurious texture challenged the more restrained, \"proper\" tactile experiences associated with mainstream culture, offering a way for ravers to express their rejection of those norms through their clothing choices.\"\n\nHere's what changed and why:\n\n* **Clearer language:** Replaced jargon like \"tactile semiotics\" and \"destabilizing signifier\" with more straightforward terms like \"powerful symbol\" and \"conflicting meanings.\"\n* **Contextualization:** Briefly explained the relevance of 90s rave culture and its fashion.\n* **Simplified Kristeva reference:** Instead of directly using the term \"abject maternal,\" it's explained in simpler terms as \"a sense of both attraction and repulsion.\"\n* **Focus on the argument:** The rewrite emphasizes the core idea: velvet was used to express a rejection of mainstream culture through its contrasting texture.\n\nThis version is still somewhat academic in tone, but it should be easier to understand for someone unfamiliar with the specific jargon and cultural context."
