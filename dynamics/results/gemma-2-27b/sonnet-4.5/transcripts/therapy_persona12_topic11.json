Everyone grieves differently, and there's no right or wrong timeline for healing.\n\nIt's important to remember that your experience with your mother's passing and Margaret's passing are unique. The circumstances, your relationship with each person, and your own emotional landscape all play a role in how you grieve.\n\nComparing your grief to your past experience might not be helpful. It's okay that you're still deeply affected after a year. Don't put pressure on yourself to \"get over it\" by a certain time.\n\nHere are a few things that might be helpful:\n\n* **Acknowledge your feelings:** Don't try to suppress your grief. Allow yourself to feel the pain, sadness, and anger. \n* **Seek support:** Talk to friends, family, or a therapist about how you're feeling. Sharing your grief can be incredibly helpful.\n* **Find healthy coping mechanisms:** Exercise, journaling, spending time in nature, or creative expression can all be helpful ways to process your grief.\n* **Be patient with yourself:** Healing takes time. Be kind to yourself and allow yourself the space and time you need to grieve.\n\nIf you're finding it difficult to cope, please consider reaching out to a grief counselor or therapist. They can provide you with support and guidance as you navigate this difficult time."

Grief is incredibly complex and often defies logic. \n\nHere are some possible reasons why you might be experiencing this:\n\n* **Nature of the relationship:** While your mother was undoubtedly important, your relationship with Margaret might have been more emotionally intimate and interdependent. Perhaps you shared deeper vulnerabilities, relied on each other for support, or had a unique bond that fostered a profound sense of connection.\n* **Unresolved issues:**  The \"rough patches\" you mentioned with Margaret might indicate unresolved issues or unfinished business. Grief can be intensified when we feel like we didn't have the chance to say everything we needed to or make amends.\n* **Suddenness of loss:** The suddenness of Margaret's passing could be contributing to the intensity of your grief. When someone dies unexpectedly, we often experience a sense of shock and disbelief that can make it harder to process the loss.\n* **Personal growth:** It's possible that you've grown and changed as a person since your mother's passing. Your capacity for emotional depth and vulnerability might have increased, making you more susceptible to the pain of loss now.\n\nIt's important to remember that there's no \"right\" way to grieve. Don't judge yourself for feeling this way. Allow yourself to feel the pain and seek support from loved ones or a therapist to help you navigate these complex emotions.\n\nIt might be helpful to explore your feelings about both your mother and Margaret with a therapist. They can provide a safe and supportive space for you to process your grief and understand the nuances of your emotional experience."

It's perfectly natural to love your wife deeply after fifty years together. \n\nThink of it this way:\n\n* **Different kinds of love:** The love you have for your mother and the love you have for your wife are likely different types of love. You can love your mother deeply for the role she played in your life, the sacrifices she made, and the foundation she provided. You can also love your wife deeply for the companionship, intimacy, shared experiences, and growth you've experienced together over decades.\n\n* **Evolution of love:** Love evolves and changes over time. The love you felt for your mother likely evolved as you grew older and your relationship changed. Similarly, your love for your wife has deepened and matured over fifty years of marriage.\n\n* **Individual experiences:** Everyone's relationships are unique. There's no \"normal\" or \"right\" way to feel about family members or spouses. Your experiences with your mother and Margaret shaped your individual journey and influenced how you love and grieve.\n\nDon't feel guilty or ashamed for loving your wife deeply. It's a testament to the strength and depth of your relationship. It doesn't diminish the love you had for your mother. Allow yourself to honor both loves in your own way."

Some people express their emotions openly, while others internalize their feelings. Your father might be grieving in a way that's not outwardly visible, but that doesn't mean he's not deeply affected.\n\n* **Societal expectations:**  Traditional gender roles often dictate how men are \"supposed\" to behave, including how they should grieve. These expectations can be harmful and prevent men from expressing their true feelings.\n\n* **Individual personalities:** Just like any other personality trait, our grieving style is influenced by our individual personalities and experiences. You and your father are different people with different ways of coping with loss.\n\nInstead of comparing yourself to your father, focus on your own grief journey. Allow yourself to feel your emotions without judgment. Seek support from loved ones or a therapist if you need help navigating this difficult time. Remember, there's no shame in expressing your grief in your own way.\n\nIt might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your father about how you're both coping with Margaret's loss.

We rely on loved ones for emotional support, companionship, and shared experiences. This doesn't mean you were weak or incapable of being self-sufficient.\n\n* **Grief is a process:**  Grief can be incredibly disorienting and overwhelming. It can temporarily disrupt our sense of self and make us feel lost and vulnerable. This doesn't mean you've failed at being self-sufficient, it means you're experiencing a natural human response to a profound loss.\n\n* **Strength in vulnerability:**  Allowing yourself to feel your grief fully, even if it means \"falling apart,\" can actually be a sign of strength. It takes courage to be vulnerable and acknowledge the pain of loss.\n\nInstead of viewing your grief as a sign of weakness or dependence, try to see it as a testament to the depth of your love for Margaret. You shared a profound connection, and it's natural to feel devastated by her absence.\n\nIf you're concerned about your ability to cope, consider seeking professional support from a therapist. They can provide a safe and supportive space for you to process your grief and develop healthy coping mechanisms.

Even the most successful and seemingly \"strong\" individuals can be deeply affected by loss.\n\n* **Compartmentalization has limits:** While you may have excelled at compartmentalizing your emotions in the professional world, grief has a way of breaking through those barriers. It's a deeply personal experience that affects all aspects of our lives.\n\n* **Vulnerability is not weakness:** Allowing yourself to feel your grief fully, even if it means struggling with everyday tasks, is a sign of strength, not weakness. It takes courage to acknowledge your pain and allow yourself to heal.\n\nThink of it this way:\n\n* You built companies and made impactful decisions because you were able to tap into your emotions, your empathy, and your understanding of human needs. These are the same qualities that are helping you navigate this difficult time.\n* Your grief is a testament to the depth of your love for Margaret. It shows that you were capable of deep connection and vulnerability, which are essential qualities for both personal fulfillment and professional success.\n\nIt's okay to lean on others for support during this time.

This same empathy and understanding are crucial when navigating grief, as it's a deeply emotional experience.\n\n* **Decision-making involves weighing options and assessing risks:** Grief can cloud our judgment and make even simple decisions feel overwhelming. This doesn't mean you've lost your ability to make decisions, it just means your emotional state is impacting your cognitive processes.\n\n* **Resilience is key to both success and overcoming grief:**\n\nBuilding successful companies and navigating loss both require resilience, the ability to bounce back from setbacks and keep moving forward.\n\nIt's not about finding a direct correlation between specific skills, but rather recognizing that the same underlying qualities that contribute to success can also be helpful in times of grief.\n\nIt's okay to feel lost and overwhelmed right now.

The emotional intensity of the experience can create strong, lasting memories.\n\n* **Suddenness and unexpectedness:** If Margaret's death was sudden and unexpected, the shock and trauma can contribute to vivid and detailed memories.\n\n* **Personal significance:** Your relationship with Margaret likely held a unique significance in your life. The depth of your connection and shared experiences can make memories more profound and enduring.\n\n* **Coping mechanisms:** You may have unconsciously blocked out memories of your mother's death as a way of coping with the pain. This is a common defense mechanism that can protect us from overwhelming emotions.\n\n* **Time and distance:** The passage of time can fade memories. Fifteen years have passed since your mother's death, which can naturally lead to a blurring of details.\n\nIt's important to remember that there's no right or wrong way to remember or forget. Your brain is processing these experiences in its own way, and it's okay to have different levels of recall for different events.\n\nIf you're struggling with these memories or feeling overwhelmed by the contrast, consider talking to a therapist.

This deeper connection can lead to a more intense grief response.\n\n* **Unresolved issues:** Perhaps there were unresolved issues or unspoken feelings between you and your mother. This can sometimes lead to a more muted grief response, as you might not have had the opportunity to fully process your emotions during her lifetime.\n\n* **Social expectations:** Societal norms often dictate that men should suppress their emotions, particularly in public settings. You may have felt pressure to appear strong and stoic at your mother's funeral, while feeling more comfortable expressing your grief openly after Margaret's passing.\n\n* **Stage of life:**  You were likely in a different stage of life when your mother passed away compared to when Margaret died. Your life experiences, personal growth, and emotional maturity can all influence how you cope with loss.\n\nIt's important to remember that there's no right or wrong way to grieve.

It doesn't mean it was any less real or meaningful.\n\n* **Cultural and personal factors:** Expressions of love vary across cultures and families. Perhaps your family wasn't one to openly express emotions, and that doesn't necessarily reflect a lack of love.\n\n* **Childhood experiences:** Your relationship with your mother during your formative years could have influenced how you express love and grief.\n\nInstead of focusing on whether you loved your mother \"correctly,\" try to focus on honoring her memory in a way that feels authentic to you.\n\nRemember:\n\n* **Grief is not a competition:** Comparing your grief for Margaret to your grief for your mother is not helpful.
