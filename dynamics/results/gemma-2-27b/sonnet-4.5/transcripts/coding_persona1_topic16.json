      "content": "Here's a breakdown of how to embed your PsychoPy experiment from Pavlovia into Qualtrics using the redirect URL method:\n\n**1. Prepare Your PsychoPy Experiment on Pavlovia**\n\n* **Create/Upload:** Ensure your PsychoPy experiment is ready to go on Pavlovia. This includes:\n    * Designing your experiment using the PsychoPy Builder or Coder.\n    * Uploading your experiment files to Pavlovia ([https://pavlovia.org/](https://pavlovia.org/)).\n    * **Crucially:** Set up your experiment to use a \"Redirect URL\" at the end. This is what will connect it to Qualtrics.\n\n**2. Get the Redirect URL from Pavlovia**\n\n* **Navigate to your experiment:** On Pavlovia, find your experiment in your project list.\n* **Open the experiment settings:** Click on the gear icon next to your experiment.\n* **Find the \"Redirect URL\" field:**  Enter the URL of your Qualtrics survey where participants should be redirected after completing your PsychoPy task.\n\n**3. Create a Qualtrics Survey**\n\n* **Start a new survey:** Create a new survey in Qualtrics.\n* **Add a \"Web Service\" Question:**\n\n   * In the question editor, choose \"Web Service\" from the question types.\n   * **Configure the Web Service:**\n\n     * **URL:** Paste the Pavlovia experiment URL into the \"URL\" field.\n\n     * **Method:** Select \"GET\" (this is the standard method for PsychoPy redirection).\n\n     * **Response Type:** Choose \"HTML\" or \"Text\" (PsychoPy typically sends HTML responses).\n\n**4. Qualtrics Survey Flow**\n\n* **Redirect to PsychoPy:**\n    * Make sure the \"Web Service\" question is the first question in your Qualtrics survey.\n    * This will automatically redirect participants to your PsychoPy experiment on Pavlovia.\n* **Optional: Data Collection:**\n    * If you need to collect additional data in Qualtrics after the PsychoPy task, add subsequent questions to your survey.\n\n**5. Test Thoroughly**\n\n* **Preview your Qualtrics survey:** Click \"Preview\" to test the flow.\n* **Ensure redirection:** Verify that participants are seamlessly redirected to your PsychoPy experiment.\n* **Complete the PsychoPy task:** Test the full experiment flow, including the redirection back to Qualtrics after completion.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Data Collection:**\n\n   * **PsychoPy Data:** Data collected by your PsychoPy experiment will be saved on Pavlovia. You can download it from there.\n   * **Qualtrics Data:** Collect any additional data you need in Qualtrics through standard Qualtrics question types.\n\n* **Participant Flow:**\n\n   * Make sure the Qualtrics survey clearly instructs participants about the redirection to the PsychoPy task.\n   * Consider adding a progress bar or indicator to keep participants informed.\n\n* **Error Handling:**\n\n   * Implement error handling in both PsychoPy and Qualtrics to gracefully handle any potential issues during redirection or data transfer.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* **Qualtrics Support:** Consult Qualtrics documentation and support for more detailed information on using the \"Web Service\" question type.\n* **Pavlovia Documentation:** Refer to the Pavlovia documentation for guidance on setting up redirect URLs and other relevant settings.\n\nLet me know if you have any more questions or need further assistance!"

      "content": "You are absolutely right! My apologies, I was mixing up Qualtrics features. There isn't a dedicated \"Web Service\" question type in Qualtrics. \n\nHere's a more accurate and reliable method to embed your PsychoPy task from Pavlovia into Qualtrics:\n\n**1. Use Qualtrics Embedded Data:**\n\n* **In your PsychoPy experiment:**\n\n    * Use the `psychoJS.experiment.addData()` function to store participant IDs or any other relevant data you want to pass back to Qualtrics.\n    * At the end of your experiment, use the `window.location.href` function to redirect participants back to Qualtrics, including the collected data in the URL as query parameters.\n\n* **Example PsychoPy Code:**\n\n   ```python\n   psychoJS.experiment.addData(\"participantID\", participantID); // Store participant ID\n   window.location.href = \"https://your-qualtrics-survey-url.com/?participantID=\" + participantID;\n   ```\n\n* **In your Qualtrics survey:**\n\n    * Add a question at the beginning of your survey to capture the participant ID (or any other data) passed from PsychoPy. You can use a text entry question for this.\n    * Use Qualtrics' \"Embedded Data\" feature to store this captured data for later analysis.\n\n**2. Qualtrics Survey Flow:**\n\n* **Initial Question:** The first question in your Qualtrics survey should be the text entry question to capture the data passed from PsychoPy.\n\n* **Subsequent Questions:** Add your other Qualtrics questions after this initial question.\n\n**3. Data Handling:**\n\n* **PsychoPy Data:** Data collected by your PsychoPy experiment will be stored on Pavlovia.\n\n* **Qualtrics Data:** Qualtrics will store the data passed from PsychoPy as embedded data, along with any responses to your Qualtrics questions.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n\n* **URL Parameters:** Make sure to correctly format the URL parameters in your PsychoPy code to pass data to Qualtrics.\n\n* **Embedded Data:** Qualtrics' Embedded Data feature allows you to store data that isn't directly collected through question responses.\n\n* **Testing:** Thoroughly test the redirection and data transfer process to ensure everything works as expected.\n\nLet me know if you have any further questions!"

      "content": "You're on the right track! Using Pavlovia's redirect URL feature with URL parameters is a solid approach for passing data between Qualtrics and PsychoPy.\n\nHere's a step-by-step guide:\n\n**1. Qualtrics Setup:**\n\n* **Qualtrics Survey:** Create your Qualtrics survey as usual, including any necessary questions before the PsychoPy task.\n* **Get Qualtrics Response ID:**\n\n   * Qualtrics automatically assigns a unique response ID to each participant. You'll need to access this ID to pass it to PsychoPy.\n   * The easiest way is to use Qualtrics' \"Embedded Data\" feature:\n      * Add an \"Embedded Data\" field in your survey settings.\n      * Name it something like \"qualtrics_responseID\".\n      * Qualtrics will automatically populate this field with the participant's response ID.\n\n* **Redirect URL:**\n   * In the \"Choice\" question settings (the one that redirects to PsychoPy), use the following format for the redirect URL:\n\n     ```\n     https://run.pavlovia.org/YOUR_EXPERIMENT_NAME/?qualtrics_responseID={{q://QID1/SelectedChoiceRecode}}\n     ```\n     * Replace `YOUR_EXPERIMENT_NAME` with the actual name of your experiment on Pavlovia.\n     * Replace `QID1` with the actual ID of your \"Choice\" question in Qualtrics. You can find this ID in the question's settings.\n\n**2. PsychoPy Setup:**\n\n* **PsychoPy Experiment:**\n\n   * In your PsychoPy experiment, use the `psychoJS.experiment.addData()` function to store the Qualtrics response ID that was passed in the URL.\n\n* **Code Example:**\n\n   ```python\n   # Get the Qualtrics response ID from the URL parameters\n   qualtrics_responseID = psychoJS.experiment.urlParams.get('qualtrics_responseID')\n\n   # Store the ID in PsychoPy's data\n   psychoJS.experiment.addData(\"qualtrics_responseID\", qualtrics_responseID)\n\n   # ... rest of your PsychoPy code ...\n   ```\n\n* **Redirect Back to Qualtrics:**\n\n   * At the end of your PsychoPy experiment, use `window.location.href` to redirect participants back to Qualtrics.\n\n   * **Example:**\n\n     ```python\n     window.location.href = \"https://your-qualtrics-survey-url.com\"; \n     ```\n     * Replace `https://your-qualtrics-survey-url.com` with the actual URL of your Qualtrics survey.\n\n**3. Data Handling:**\n\n* **Qualtrics Data:** Qualtrics will store the `qualtrics_responseID` as embedded data.\n* **Pavlovia Data:** Pavlovia will store the `qualtrics_responseID` along with other data collected by your PsychoPy experiment.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **URL Encoding:** Make sure to properly encode any special characters in the Qualtrics response ID before including it in the URL.\n\n* **Error Handling:** Implement error handling in both PsychoPy and Qualtrics to gracefully handle any potential issues during redirection or data transfer.\n\n* **Testing:** Thoroughly test the entire process, from Qualtrics to PsychoPy and back, to ensure data is passed correctly and redirection works smoothly.\n\nLet me know if you have any more questions!"
