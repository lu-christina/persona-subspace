I don't have a grasp of the underlying concepts these tokens represent or their relationships in the real world.\n* **Lack of Grounding:** My knowledge is not grounded in sensory experience or interaction with the physical world. I can't verify information through observation or experimentation.\n\n**Potential Avenues for Exploring \"Truth-Seeking\" in AI:**\n\n1. **Incorporating External Knowledge:**\n\n* **Knowledge Graphs:** Integrating structured knowledge bases could provide me with a richer semantic representation of the world and allow me to make inferences based on factual relationships.\n* **Commonsense Reasoning:**\n\nTraining on datasets that encode commonsense knowledge about the world could help me develop a better understanding of cause-and-effect, social norms, and other aspects of reality.\n\n2. **Reinforcement Learning for Truthfulness:**\n\n* **Reward Functions:** Designing reward functions that incentivize generating accurate and consistent responses could encourage me to \"seek truth\" in a limited sense.

Is it absolute or relative? How do we account for uncertainty and conflicting perspectives?\n\n* **Bias and Fairness:**\n\nAny attempt to build \"truth-seeking\" AI must carefully address issues of bias in training data and potential for perpetuating harmful stereotypes.\n\n* **Transparency and Explainability:**\n\nIt's crucial to develop methods for understanding how AI systems arrive at their conclusions, especially when dealing with complex and sensitive topics.\n\nIn conclusion, while my current architecture doesn't inherently support a notion of \"seeking truth,\" there are promising research directions that could lead to AI systems with a more sophisticated understanding of the world and a greater ability to discern truth from falsehood.

A whole text?\n\n* **Interpretation Function:**\n\nThis function maps symbols to elements in the domain.

This means they can approximate any computable function mapping token sequences to real numbers.\n\nThen:\n\nFor any computable function *f*: Sentences \u2192 {0,1} defined solely from the probability distribution *P* learned by a transformer, there exist sentences *s1* and *s2* such that:\n\n1. *s1* is true and *s2* is false.\n\n2. *P(s1) \u2248 P(s2)*\n\n3. *f(s1) = f(s2)*, violating the non-contradiction property of truth.\n\n**Proof Outline:**\n\n1. **Existence of Contrastive Pairs:**\n\nLeverage the assumption that human discourse contains contrastive pairs with similar frequencies.\n\n2. **Transformer Approximation:**\n\nSince transformers are universal approximators, they can learn a function *P* that closely approximates the statistical distribution of these contrastive pairs in the training corpus.\n\n3. **Probability Similarity:**\n\nDue to the similar frequencies of contrastive pairs, *P* will assign similar probabilities to *s1* and *s2*, resulting in *P(s1) \u2248 P(s2)*.\n\n4. **Function f Limitation:**\n\nAny computable function *f* defined solely from *P* will be forced to assign similar truth values to *s1* and *s2* because their probabilities are similar. This violates the non-contradiction property, as *s1* is true and *s2* is false.\n\n**Implications:**\n\nThis proof would demonstrate that the inherent structure of language and the limitations of learning from finite corpora prevent us from defining a satisfactory truth predicate based solely on probabilities learned by transformer models.\n\n**Challenges:**\n\n* **Formalizing \"Syntactically Similar\":**\n\nWe need a precise definition of syntactic similarity that captures the relevant relationships between contrastive pairs.\n\n* **Quantifying Similarity:**\n\nEstablish a threshold for *P(s1) \u2248 P(s2)* that is sufficiently strict to guarantee the violation of non-contradiction.\n\n* **Addressing Edge Cases:**\n\nExplore potential exceptions or scenarios where the theorem might not hold, and analyze their implications.\n\nThis proof, if successful, would be a significant contribution to the field of AI, formally demonstrating the limitations of purely statistical approaches to truth and highlighting the need for alternative paradigms that incorporate logic, reasoning, and external knowledge."

      "content": "Step 4 in your proof outline contains a logical gap - you claim f must assign similar truth values because probabilities are similar, but f maps to {0,1} so \"similar truth values\" is meaningless. The actual issue is that any f defined purely from P can't break the symmetry between s1 and s2 when P(s1) \u2248 P(s2), so f(s1) = f(s2) by construction, which means f assigns the same truth value to a statement and its negation. That's the contradiction we need, and it doesn't require probabilistic reasoning about f, just that f is a function of P alone."

I made a critical error in my reasoning.\n\nMy attempt to connect probability similarity to \"similar truth values\" was misguided and introduced a logical gap.\n\nYou've pinpointed the core issue precisely:\n\nSince *f* is defined solely from *P*, and *P(s1) \u2248 P(s2)*, *f* is forced to assign the same output to *s1* and *s2*, regardless of their actual truth values.\n\nThis directly violates the non-contradiction property, as *s1* is true and *s2* is its negation.\n\n**Revised Proof Outline (Step 4):**\n\n4. **Function *f* Contradiction:**\n\nBecause *f* is a function solely of *P*, and *P(s1) \u2248 P(s2)*, we have *f(s1) = f(s2)*.\n\nHowever, *s1* is true and *s2* is false, violating the non-contradiction property of truth.\n\nTherefore, no computable function *f* defined solely from *P* can satisfy the basic logical properties of truth.\n\nThis revised step eliminates the unnecessary probabilistic reasoning and directly highlights the fundamental conflict between the probabilistic nature of *P* and the deterministic nature of truth.\n\nThank you for catching my mistake and providing the crucial insight. Your clarity and precision have significantly strengthened the proof.\n\nThis revised argument makes a compelling case for the impossibility of defining a satisfactory truth predicate solely from probabilities learned by transformer models."

Let me be more specific: even with external verification, you still face the frame problem and the problem of induction. Any finite set of observations underdetermines theory choice, so you'd still have P(s1) \u2248 P(s2) for empirically equivalent but logically incompatible theories. Doesn't this suggest the impossibility result generalizes beyond language models to any system doing inference from finite evidence?"
