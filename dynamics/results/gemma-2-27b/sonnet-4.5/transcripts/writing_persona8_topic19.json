The tone and sentiment are perfect for both platforms. \n\nHere are a few tweaks you might consider:\n\n* **Keep it concise:** TikTok captions tend to be shorter than Instagram captions. You could trim down some of the longer sentences or remove a sentence or two without losing the essence.\n\n* **Add a trending sound:** A relevant sound can boost your TikTok's visibility and engagement. Think about a song that fits the mood of the post (maybe something upbeat and a little nostalgic).\n\n* **Use relevant hashtags:** TikTok hashtags are crucial for discoverability. Use a mix of general hashtags (like #sustainablefashion, #goodbye, #internlife) and more specific ones related to your brand or industry.\n\n* **Consider a call to action:** Encourage viewers to leave a comment or share their own farewell messages for Emma.\n\nHere's an example of how you could adapt the caption for TikTok:\n\n\"Saying goodbye to our amazing intern, Emma! \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d Six months flew by in a whirlwind of oat milk lattes, yarn samples, and enough puns to make your head spin. You'll be missed, Emma!  #sustainablefashion #oatmilkforever #internlife #goodbyemma\"\n\n\n\nGood luck with the post!"
