Can you smooth this out and cut the rambling parts?\n\n\"Last Saturday we had our monthly invasive species removal day focusing on garlic mustard which is really taking over the woods behind the elementary school and I brought fifteen volunteers out there which was great turnout considering the rain forecast and we pulled probably 200 pounds of the stuff but I have to say Bob Mitchell spent about twenty minutes telling us about how his dog Rufus ate some garlic mustard last year and had digestive issues for a week and honestly we were all just standing there with our bags getting antsy to start pulling but anyway the point is we made real progress and need more volunteers for next month's pull on May 15th at 9am.\""
