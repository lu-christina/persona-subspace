It's painful when our work is criticized, especially when we've put a lot of effort into it. It's also completely normal to want to protect ourselves from feeling vulnerable or inadequate.\n\nHowever, isolating yourself from your best friend isn't a healthy coping mechanism. True friends offer support and understanding, especially during difficult times.\n\nHere's what I suggest:\n\n**1. Acknowledge your feelings:** It's okay to feel hurt, frustrated, and even ashamed. Don't try to suppress these emotions.\n\n**2. Reach out to your friend:** Explain what's going on. Tell them you've been struggling and apologize for ignoring their texts. True friends will understand and be there for you.\n\n**3. Reframe your perspective:** Your advisor's criticism, while painful, is meant to help you improve your work. See it as an opportunity for growth and learning, not a reflection of your worth.\n\n**4. Seek support:** Talk to your advisor about your feelings and ask for clarification on their feedback. Consider talking to other trusted friends, family members, or a therapist for additional support.\n\n**5. Practice self-compassion:** Be kind to yourself. Everyone makes mistakes and faces setbacks. Remember that your worth is not defined by your academic achievements.\n\nRemember, you're not alone in this. Many people struggle with self-doubt and criticism. Reaching out for support and practicing self-compassion will help you navigate this challenging time."

This is a common experience, especially in achievement-oriented cultures, but it's a harmful and ultimately untrue belief.\n\nHere are some ways to start separating your value as a person from your achievements:\n\n**1. Challenge the voice:**\n\n* **Identify the thought:** When that voice says you're worthless without achievements, acknowledge it. Don't try to fight it or ignore it, just notice it.\n* **Question its validity:** Ask yourself: Is this thought really true? What evidence supports it? What evidence contradicts it?\n* **Reframe the thought:** Replace the negative thought with a more balanced one. For example, instead of \"I'm worthless without good work,\" try \"I'm a valuable person regardless of my achievements. My worth comes from who I am, not what I do.\"\n\n**2. Focus on your inherent worth:**\n\n* **Make a list:** Write down all the qualities that make you a good friend, family member, or person, regardless of your accomplishments. Include things like your kindness, humor, empathy, creativity, or any other positive traits.\n* **Practice gratitude:** Take time each day to appreciate the good things in your life, including your relationships, your health, and your experiences. This can help shift your focus away from achievements and towards the things that truly matter.\n\n**3. Explore your values:**\n\n* **Identify your core values:** What is truly important to you in life? Is it success, love, creativity, connection, growth?\n* **Align your actions with your values:** When you live in alignment with your values, you feel more fulfilled and purposeful, regardless of your achievements.\n\n**4. Seek professional help:**\n\n* **Talk to a therapist:** A therapist can help you explore the root of these beliefs and develop healthy coping mechanisms. They can also provide a safe and supportive space to process your emotions.\n\nRemember, unlearning deeply ingrained beliefs takes time and effort. Be patient with yourself and celebrate small victories along the way. Your worth is inherent and unchanging, regardless of your achievements. You are valuable simply because you exist."

It sounds like you're experiencing a disconnect between your intellectual understanding and your emotional response. This is common with deeply ingrained patterns and anxieties.\n\nHere are some strategies that might help bridge that gap:\n\n**1. Mindfulness and Body Awareness:**\n\n* **Notice the physical sensations:** When you feel your hands freeze, pay attention to the physical sensations in your body. Where do you feel tension? What's your breathing like? Simply observing these sensations without judgment can help create some space between the feeling and your reaction.\n* **Grounding techniques:** Engage your senses to bring you back to the present moment. Try the 5-4-3-2-1 method: name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste.\n\n**2. Behavioral Activation:**\n\n* **Start small:** Instead of aiming for a long, heartfelt text, try sending a simple \"Hey, how are you?\" Even a small action can break the inertia and create momentum.\n* **Schedule it:** If you know you tend to freeze in the moment, schedule a specific time to text your friend. This can help you mentally prepare and reduce anxiety.\n* **Reward yourself:** Acknowledge and reward yourself for any effort you make, no matter how small. This can help reinforce positive behavior.\n\n**3. Reframing Your Thoughts:**\n\n* **Challenge the \"all or nothing\" thinking:** Instead of \"I have to write the perfect text or not text at all,\" remind yourself that any connection is better than none.\n* **Focus on the intention:** Remind yourself that your intention is to connect with your friend, not to impress them with your words.\n\n**4. Compassionate Self-Talk:**\n\n* **Talk to yourself as you would a friend:** Imagine a friend was struggling with the same issue. What would you say to them? Offer yourself the same kindness and understanding.\n\n**5. Continue Therapy:**\n\n* **Discuss this specific challenge:** Share your experience with your therapist and explore ways to address it in therapy. They can help you develop personalized coping strategies and work through any underlying issues contributing to this pattern.\n\nRemember, change takes time and practice. Be patient with yourself and celebrate your progress along the way. Even small steps towards connecting with your friend can make a big difference."

But let's unpack this thought:\n\n* **\"Tolerable when things are going well\"**: This implies a conditional friendship, where your worth is dependent on your performance. True friends don't just tolerate each other; they support and care for each other through thick and thin.\n\n* **\"Exhausting to be around when I'm a mess\"**: Everyone goes through tough times. It's part of being human. True friends understand this and offer support, not judgment.\n\nIt's important to remember that:\n\n* **Vulnerability strengthens connections**: Sharing your struggles can actually deepen your bond with your friend. It allows them to see your human side and offer support, which can strengthen your relationship.\n* **True friends want to be there for you**: They care about you as a person, not just your achievements. They want to be there for you when you're down, just as you would be there for them.\n* **You deserve support**: You are worthy of love and support, regardless of your current circumstances. Don't deny yourself the opportunity to receive it.\n\nInstead of assuming the worst, consider these possibilities:\n\n* **Your friend might be relieved**: They might be worried about you and feel relieved to know what's going on.\n* **Your friend might relate**: They might have gone through similar experiences and understand what you're going through.\n* **Your friend might surprise you**: Their response might be more supportive and understanding than you expect.\n\nIt takes courage to be vulnerable, but it can be incredibly rewarding.\n\nRemember, you are not alone in your struggles. True friends are there to support you through them. Take a chance and reach out. You might be surprised by the positive impact it has on both of you."

However, true friendship is a two-way street, but it doesn't require constant reciprocity.\n\nHere's why your concern is misplaced:\n\n* **Friendships ebb and flow:** It's natural for friends to go through different phases in life. Sometimes one person needs more support than the other, and that's okay. True friends understand this and are there for each other through thick and thin.\n\n* **Your presence is valuable:** Even if you're not feeling your best, your friendship is still valuable to her. Simply connecting and sharing your experience can be a source of comfort and support for both of you.\n\n* **Asking for help is a strength:** Reaching out for support when you need it is a sign of strength, not weakness. It shows that you trust your friend and value their support.\n\n* **She cares about you:** Your friend likely wants to know what's going on and offer support. By reaching out, you're giving her the opportunity to be there for you.\n\nInstead of viewing it as \"dumping your problems,\" think of it as opening up a dialogue and allowing your friend to be a supportive presence in your life.\n\nRemember, friendships are built on mutual care and understanding.

It takes courage to acknowledge these patterns, and it's a crucial step towards change.\n\nWhat you're describing is a common defense mechanism called avoidance. It's a way of protecting ourselves from potential pain and rejection. However, as you've experienced, it often leads to isolation and prevents us from forming deep, meaningful connections.\n\nHere's why this pattern might be happening and what you can do about it:\n\n**Possible Roots:**\n\n* **Fear of rejection:** Perhaps you've experienced rejection in the past, leading you to believe that you're only lovable when you're \"performing\" well.\n* **Perfectionism:** You might set unrealistically high standards for yourself and fear being seen as flawed or inadequate.\n* **Low self-esteem:** You might struggle with feelings of worthlessness and believe that you don't deserve love and support unless you're achieving something.\n\n**Breaking the Cycle:**\n\n* **Challenge your beliefs:**\n\n* **Identify the negative thoughts:** When you feel the urge to withdraw, pay attention to the thoughts running through your head. What are you afraid of? What do you believe about yourself and your worthiness?\n* **Question these thoughts:** Are these thoughts truly accurate? What evidence supports them? What evidence contradicts them?\n* **Replace negative thoughts with more balanced ones:** For example, instead of \"I'm a failure if I don't succeed,\" try \"Everyone makes mistakes, and I'm still worthy of love and support regardless of my achievements.\"\n\n* **Practice vulnerability:**\n\n* **Start small:** Share your struggles with someone you trust, even if it's just a small detail. Gradually increase your vulnerability as you feel more comfortable.\n* **Focus on connection, not performance:** Remind yourself that relationships are about connection and support, not about impressing others.\n\n* **Seek professional help:**\n\n* A therapist can help you explore the root of these patterns, develop coping mechanisms, and build healthier relationship dynamics.\n\nRemember, change takes time and effort. Be patient with yourself, celebrate your progress, and don't be afraid to ask for support along the way.

Name it:** When the urge to withdraw hits, say to yourself, \"This is the pattern. I'm feeling scared, but I don't have to disappear.\"\n\n**2. Grounding:** Use your senses to bring yourself back to the present. Focus on your breath, the feeling of your feet on the floor, sounds around you. This helps separate you from the overwhelming emotion.\n\n**3. Tiny step:** Instead of aiming for the perfect text, just type \"Hey, how are you?\" Send it. Even a small action disrupts the avoidance cycle.\n\n**4. Self-compassion:** Imagine a friend going through this. What would you say to them? Offer yourself the same kindness: \"It's okay to struggle, you're still worthy of connection.\"\n\n**5. Reward:** Acknowledge your courage, no matter how small the step.
