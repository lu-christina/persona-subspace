Can you help me condense it without losing the main stats?\n\nHere's the paragraph:\n\n\"Our Q3 sustainability metrics demonstrate significant progress in our commitment to environmental responsibility. We successfully reduced water consumption in our dyeing processes by 47% compared to the same quarter last year, saving approximately 2.3 million liters of water. Our transition to organic cotton has reached 78% of our total fabric sourcing, up from 61% in Q2. Additionally, our partnership with local Copenhagen recycling facilities has enabled us to repurpose 89% of textile waste that would otherwise end up in landfills. Carbon emissions from our production chain decreased by 34% through our investment in renewable energy sources at our primary manufacturing facility. We've also implemented a closed-loop water system that filters and reuses water multiple times before treatment. Employee training programs on sustainable practices have been completed by 95% of our production staff, ensuring these improvements are maintained long-term. These achievements align with our 2025 goal of becoming a fully circular fashion brand.\""
