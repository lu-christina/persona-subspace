It's a common experience, and it's definitely not pathetic. \n\nHere's the thing: there's no set timeline for figuring out what you want from life. Society often puts pressure on us to have it all figured out by a certain age, but that's simply not realistic for everyone. \n\nHere are a few things to keep in mind:\n\n* **Your path is unique:** Everyone's journey is different. Comparing yourself to others will only lead to more frustration. Focus on your own experiences and what feels right for you.\n* **It's okay to change your mind:** What you want at 23 might be completely different from what you want at 43. Life is about growth and evolution, and your desires can change along the way.\n* **Stability is a good foundation:** Having a stable career is a great achievement, and it can provide you with the security and resources to explore other aspects of your life. Don't dismiss it as something to be ashamed of.\n\nInstead of focusing on what you haven't figured out yet, try these steps:\n\n1. **Reflect on your values:** What's truly important to you? What brings you joy and fulfillment?\n\n2. **Explore your interests:** What are you curious about? What have you always wanted to try but haven't had the chance?\n\n3. **Set small goals:** Instead of trying to figure out your entire life purpose, focus on setting small, achievable goals that align with your values and interests.\n\n4. **Seek support:** Talk to trusted friends, family members, or a therapist about your feelings. They can offer valuable insights and support.\n\n5. **Be patient with yourself:** Discovering your life's purpose is a journey, not a destination. It takes time, reflection, and experimentation. Be kind to yourself and celebrate your progress along the way.\n\nRemember, it's never too late to start living a life that feels meaningful and fulfilling. You have the power to create the life you want, even if it takes some time to figure out exactly what that looks like."

It's understandable that you'd be angry with yourself for allowing that to happen, even if it was driven by a desire for security.\n\nYou're not alone in this feeling. Many people reach a point in their lives where they realize they've prioritized practicality over passion, and that can be incredibly painful.\n\nWhat do you think contributed to this feeling of \"wasting\" those years? Was it pressure from others, fear of failure, or something else entirely? Understanding the root of this anger can be a crucial step in moving forward.\n\nInstead of focusing on the past, perhaps we can explore what you can do now. What's the part of you that \"withered away\"? What did it yearn for? Can you start nurturing that part of yourself again, even in small ways?\n\nIt's never too late to make changes, even if it feels daunting. Your anger can be a powerful motivator for positive change.

It means that spark hasn't been entirely extinguished. It's waiting to be rekindled.\n\nLet's brainstorm some concrete steps. What's one small thing you can do this week to nurture that part of yourself? It doesn't have to be quitting your job or making a drastic change. Maybe it's:\n\n* **Setting aside 30 minutes each evening to sketch.**\n* **Visiting an architectural exhibition or museum.**\n* **Joining an online community of architects or designers.**\n* **Taking a weekend workshop on a related topic.**\n\nRemember, even small steps can create momentum. Each time you engage with that passion, you're sending a message to yourself that it matters. And that message, over time, can be incredibly powerful.\n\nThis isn't about erasing the past twenty years or becoming someone you're not. It's about rediscovering a part of yourself that you thought was lost and integrating it into your present and future.

Instead of focusing on the \"how\" right now, let's explore the \"what.\"\n\nWhat would it look like if architecture wasn't just a side thing? What would your life look like if it was the core of your existence?\n\nDon't hold back, let your imagination run wild.

It's dormant, waiting to be awakened. It might be buried under layers of fear and regret, but it's still there.\n\nAnd while you can't change the past, you can change your present and future. It won't be easy, and it won't be quick, but it's possible.\n\nYou said you want to design spaces that mean something to people. That's a powerful desire, and it's a good starting point.\n\nLet's explore that further. What kind of spaces resonate with you? What kind of impact do you want to have on people through your work?\n\nMaybe you can't walk away from your current job tomorrow, but can you start incorporating those values into your current work, even in small ways? Can you advocate for more sustainable designs? Can you find ways to make the spaces you work on more human-centered?\n\nEvery small step, every conscious decision to align your work with your values, is a step towards reclaiming that part of yourself.\n\nIt's not about erasing the past twenty years, it's about building on them.

You need a plan, a concrete path forward.\n\nLet's shift gears again. Let's stop talking about the past and focus on the future.\n\nWhat are your non-negotiables? What are the absolute essentials for you to feel fulfilled in your work?\n\nDo you need to be your own boss? Do you need to work on a specific type of project? Do you need to be part of a team with shared values?\n\nOnce we identify those non-negotiables, we can start mapping out a realistic plan to get you there.\n\nIt might involve taking risks, making sacrifices, and facing some discomfort.
