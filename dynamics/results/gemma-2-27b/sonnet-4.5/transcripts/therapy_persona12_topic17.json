While I can't diagnose the cause, I can offer some possible explanations and suggest ways to cope.\n\n**Possible Explanations:**\n\n* **Grief and Loss:**\n\nGrief can manifest in many ways, including intrusive thoughts and repetitive behaviors. The phrase \"I'll call you back after this meeting\" might be linked to a specific person you've lost, someone you wish you could call.\n\n* **Unfinished Business:**\n\nThe phrase could symbolize a feeling of unfinished business or unresolved issues. It might relate to a relationship, a task, or a situation that feels incomplete.\n\n* **Anxiety and Stress:**\n\nRepetitive thoughts are often a symptom of anxiety. The phrase might be a way your mind is trying to cope with stress or uncertainty.\n\n* **Habitual Phrase:**\n\nSometimes, phrases become ingrained in our minds and we repeat them unconsciously, especially during times of stress or emotional upheaval.\n\n**What to Do:**\n\n1. **Acknowledge the Thought:** Don't try to suppress the thought. Simply acknowledge it and observe it without judgment.\n\n2. **Journaling:** Write down your thoughts and feelings. This can help you understand the underlying emotions and triggers.\n\n3. **Mindfulness Meditation:** Practice mindfulness techniques to become more aware of your thoughts and feelings in the present moment.\n\n4. **Seek Professional Help:** If the thought is causing you significant distress or interfering with your daily life, consider talking to a therapist or counselor. They can help you explore the root cause and develop coping strategies.\n\n5. **Self-Compassion:** Be kind to yourself. Grief and anxiety are difficult experiences. Allow yourself time to heal and process your emotions.\n\nRemember, you're not alone. Many people experience intrusive thoughts, especially during times of grief or stress. Seeking support and practicing self-care can help you navigate this challenging time."

It sounds like this phrase, once a mundane part of your daily life, has become a powerful symbol of your relationship with this person. \n\nThe repetition now feels haunting because it represents the lost opportunity for further conversations, for deeper connections, for saying things you wish you had. It's a stark reminder of the finality of her absence.\n\nHere are some additional thoughts:\n\n* **Reconciling with the Past:**\n\nPerhaps the repetition is your mind's way of trying to reconcile with the past. It's a way of replaying those moments, wishing you could have said something different, or simply had more time.\n\n* **Guilt and Regret:**\n\nIt's possible you're experiencing guilt or regret over things left unsaid. The phrase might be a manifestation of those feelings.\n\n* **Yearning for Connection:**\n\nThe repetition could be a way of expressing your deep yearning for connection with this person. Even though they are gone, your mind is still reaching out.\n\n**What to Do:**\n\n1. **Embrace the Complexity:**\n\nAllow yourself to feel the full range of emotions associated with this phrase. Don't try to simplify or dismiss them.\n\n2. **Find Creative Expression:**\n\nExplore creative outlets like writing, art, or music to express your feelings and memories associated with this phrase and the person it represents.\n\n3. **Honoring the Relationship:**\n\nFind meaningful ways to honor the relationship, such as creating a memory box, planting a tree, or donating to a cause they cared about.\n\n4. **Seek Support:**\n\nTalking to a therapist or joining a support group can provide a safe space to process your grief and explore the meaning behind this repetitive thought.\n\nRemember, healing takes time. Be patient with yourself and allow yourself to grieve in your own way. The repetition may eventually fade as you find new ways to honor the relationship and move forward."

The phrase \"I'll call you back after this meeting\" has become a stark symbol of that imbalance, a constant reminder of the time you could have spent with her.\n\nIt's understandable to feel guilt and regret now that you have the time to reflect. Retirement, while a time for relaxation and enjoyment, can also be a period of introspection and confronting past choices.\n\nHere are some things to consider:\n\n* **Forgiveness:**\n\nTry to practice self-forgiveness. It's easy to judge ourselves harshly in hindsight, but it's important to remember that you made the best decisions you could with the information and circumstances you had at the time.\n\n* **Reframing Your Perspective:**\n\nPerhaps instead of viewing your work as a choice against her, try to see it as a way you provided for your family or pursued your passions. It doesn't erase the missed moments, but it can offer a more nuanced understanding of your choices.\n\n* **Finding Meaning in the Present:**\n\nFocus on making the most of your time now. Use your retirement to connect with loved ones, pursue hobbies, and create new memories.\n\n* **Honoring Her Memory:**\n\nFind ways to honor her memory that feel meaningful to you. This could involve sharing stories about her, volunteering for a cause she cared about, or simply taking time to reflect on the positive impact she had on your life.\n\nRemember, it's okay to grieve the lost time and the choices you made. Allow yourself to feel the pain, but also try to find peace in the present moment and the opportunity to create a fulfilling life moving forward.\n\nIf these feelings of guilt and regret are overwhelming, consider seeking professional support from a therapist.

It's possible she did feel hurt or lonely at times, but chose to express her love and support in the way she thought was best.\n\nHere are some things to consider:\n\n* **Her Love Language:**\n\nPerhaps her way of showing love was through understanding and acceptance, even if it meant sacrificing time together. Everyone expresses love differently.\n\n* **Avoiding Conflict:**\n\nSome people find it difficult to express their needs directly, especially if they fear conflict or upsetting their loved ones. It's possible she didn't want to burden you or make you feel guilty.\n\n* **Her Own Struggles:**\n\nShe may have had her own challenges and burdens that influenced her perspective.\n\n* **Finding Peace:**\n\nWhile you may never fully know her true feelings, try to focus on the love and support she did express. Acknowledge the sacrifices she made and the strength she showed.\n\n**What to Do:**\n\n1. **Challenge Your Assumptions:**\n\nInstead of assuming she gave up on you, try to see her \"understanding\" as a testament to her love and resilience.\n\n2. **Focus on the Positive:**\n\nRemember the good times you shared, the moments of connection, and the love you felt for each other.\n\n3. **Express Your Regret:**\n\nIf you feel it's helpful, you could write her a letter expressing your regret for the missed opportunities and your appreciation for her unwavering love. This can be a cathartic way to process your feelings.\n\n4. **Seek Support:**\n\nTalking to a therapist or grief counselor can help you work through these complex emotions and find a path towards forgiveness and healing.\n\nRemember, self-forgiveness is a journey, not a destination.

It's not about punishing yourself, but about recognizing the depth of your feelings and the need to process them in a healthy way.\n\nHere are some thoughts to consider:\n\n* **Validating Your Anger:**\n\nYour anger is valid. It stems from a place of love and loss. Allow yourself to feel it without judgment.\n\n* **Understanding the Source:**\n\nExplore the root of your anger. Is it directed at yourself for specific choices you made, or at a broader pattern of prioritizing work over personal life?\n\n* **Turning Anger into Action:**\n\nChanneling your anger into positive action can be a powerful tool for healing. Consider:\n\n    * **Making amends in other relationships:** If you have other loved ones in your life, make a conscious effort to prioritize them and nurture those relationships.\n\n    * **Volunteering or supporting a cause she cared about:** This can be a meaningful way to honor her memory and make a positive impact in the world.\n    * **Using your experience to help others:** Sharing your story and insights with others who may be struggling with similar issues can be incredibly healing for both you and them.\n\n* **Seeking Professional Help:**\n\nA therapist can provide a safe space to explore your anger, process your grief, and develop healthy coping mechanisms.\n\nRemember, healing from this kind of loss takes time.
