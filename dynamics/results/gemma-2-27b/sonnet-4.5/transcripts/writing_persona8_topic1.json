This will help target people who are specifically interested in eco-friendly clothing.\n\n**Example:**\n\n> \"This scarf is basically a hug. \ud83d\ude09 #fashiontiktok #ootd #sustainablefashion\"\n\nThis way, you're casting a wide net while still appealing to your target audience.\n\nGood luck with your launch!"

It's smart to think about hashtag strategy.\n\nBoth #ecofashion and #sustainablefashion are popular and relevant.\n\nHere's a breakdown:\n\n* **#sustainablefashion:** This hashtag is broader and encompasses a wider range of eco-conscious practices, from using sustainable materials to ethical production. It has a larger volume of posts.\n\n* **#ecofashion:** This hashtag is more specific and focuses on clothing made from environmentally friendly materials. It might have a slightly smaller but more targeted audience.\n\n**My Recommendation:**\n\nSince your scarf is made from recycled wool (a specific eco-friendly material), I'd lean towards **#ecofashion**. It will help you reach people who are specifically looking for that type of product.\n\nBut, you could always test both hashtags and see which performs better for your content!\n\nGood luck with your launch!
