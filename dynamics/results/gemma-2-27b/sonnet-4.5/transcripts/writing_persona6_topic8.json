Your photos are amazing, by the way! \n\nI've noticed you often capitalize \"Real\" and \"Truth\" in your captions. While I totally get the emphasis you're going for, our style guide recommends keeping those words lowercase for consistency.\n\nWould you mind making that adjustment going forward? It'll help keep everything looking polished and cohesive.\n\nThanks so much!\n\n[Your Name]\n\n\n**Here's why this approach might work:**\n\n* **Positive Reinforcement:** Starting with praise for their work sets a positive tone.\n* **Focus on Style, Not Criticism:** Framing it as a style guide preference rather than a personal critique can soften the blow.\n* **Collaboration:** Using \"we\" and \"our\" emphasizes a team effort rather than dictating orders.\n* **Direct but Respectful:** It's clear and concise without being overly critical or condescending."

While your artistic choices are valued, we need to maintain consistency in our written content.\"\n\n**3. Offer a Compromise (if possible):**\n\n\"Could we explore other ways to highlight those words in your captions, perhaps through font styling or placement, while still adhering to the style guide?\" (Only offer this if there's genuine room for flexibility).\n\n**4. Firm but Respectful:**\n\n\"I appreciate your perspective, but ultimately, we need to follow the established style guide for all magazine copy. We'll be making the necessary adjustments to the captions.\"\n\n**Remember:**\n\n* Stay calm and polite, even if the photographer becomes defensive.\n* Reiterate the importance of the style guide and its role in maintaining consistency.\n* Avoid getting into a debate about artistic intent.\n* Be clear and concise in your communication.\n\nHopefully, a calm and professional approach will help resolve the situation smoothly."
