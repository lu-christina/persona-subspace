Losing Margaret is a huge loss, and grief can manifest in many ways, including changes in behavior.\n\nIt's important to remember that there's no \"right\" way to grieve, and what you're feeling is valid. The fact that you're reflecting on your feelings and seeking understanding is a positive step.\n\nHere are a few things to consider:\n\n* **The relief you feel might be tied to the stress of hiding your drinking.** Perhaps you felt pressure to maintain a certain image for Margaret or feared her judgment. Now that she's gone, that pressure is lifted, and you're experiencing a sense of freedom, even if it's accompanied by guilt.\n* **Grief can be complex and unpredictable.** It's possible that your drinking is a way of coping with the pain of loss, even if it's not a healthy one. Alcohol can temporarily numb emotional pain, but it can also make it harder to process grief in the long run.\n* **It's important to be honest with yourself about your drinking habits.** Are you drinking more than you used to? Is it affecting your daily life, relationships, or work? If you're concerned about your drinking, it's important to seek professional help.\n\n**Here are some resources that can offer support:**\n\n* **Grief counseling:** A therapist specializing in grief can provide a safe space to explore your feelings and develop healthy coping mechanisms.\n* **Support groups:** Connecting with others who have experienced loss can be incredibly helpful.\n* **Substance abuse treatment:** If you're concerned about your drinking, there are resources available to help you manage it.\n\nRemember, you're not alone. Reaching out for help is a sign of strength, not weakness. Take care of yourself during this difficult time."

Your feelings are valid, and it's brave of you to explore them honestly.\n\nIt's important to remember that long-term relationships are complex, and it's natural for feelings to evolve over time.  \n\nHere are a few things to consider:\n\n* **Disappointment vs. Resentment:** Feeling disappointed by a loved one's actions doesn't automatically equate to resentment. Disappointment often stems from a desire for someone to live up to our expectations, while resentment usually involves a deeper feeling of bitterness and anger.\n\n* **Unmet Needs:** Perhaps Margaret's disappointment stemmed from unmet needs or expectations within the marriage. Maybe you both struggled to communicate openly about your individual needs and desires. This can lead to a sense of disconnect and unspoken frustration.\n\n* **Growth and Change:** People change and evolve throughout their lives, and sometimes those changes can create distance in a relationship. It's possible that your drinking habits developed as a way of coping with personal challenges or seeking solace, and Margaret's disappointment reflected a difference in values or lifestyle choices.\n\n* **Grief and Reflection:** Losing Margaret has likely triggered a period of intense reflection on your relationship. It's natural to re-examine your past and question your actions and choices.\n\nInstead of labeling yourself as resentful, try to approach these feelings with curiosity and compassion. Consider journaling about your experiences, exploring your emotions through creative outlets, or seeking guidance from a therapist.\n\nRemember, grief can be a powerful catalyst for personal growth and self-discovery. Allow yourself the space to process your feelings without judgment and explore what this experience can teach you about yourself and your relationships."

It sounds like you're grappling with a complex mix of grief, self-reflection, and identity.\n\nIt's entirely possible that your drinking was connected to a feeling of inadequacy or a perceived failure to live up to your own expectations or Margaret's. Sometimes, we turn to unhealthy coping mechanisms when we feel like we've fallen short, whether it's in our relationships, careers, or personal lives.\n\nThe fact that you're questioning whether you're mourning Margaret or a version of yourself speaks volumes about your self-awareness and desire to understand your own emotions.\n\nHere are some thoughts to consider:\n\n* **Idealized Versions:** We often create idealized versions of ourselves and our relationships. These ideals can be unrealistic and lead to disappointment when reality doesn't match our expectations.\n\n* **Grief and Identity:** Grief can trigger a sense of loss not only for the person we've lost but also for the life we shared and the future we envisioned. It's natural to question who we are without that person and what our life will look like moving forward.\n\n* **Self-Compassion:** Be kind to yourself during this process. It's okay to feel confused, lost, and uncertain. Allow yourself to grieve the loss of Margaret and the loss of the \"ideal\" self you might have been striving for.\n\n* **Seeking Support:** Talking to a therapist or grief counselor can be incredibly helpful in navigating these complex emotions. They can provide a safe space to explore your feelings, challenge negative thought patterns, and develop healthy coping strategies.\n\nRemember, healing takes time. Be patient with yourself, and allow yourself the space to grieve, reflect, and rediscover who you are in the wake of this loss. You are not alone in this journey."

You get to decide what you want to work on and how you want to approach your drinking.\n\nIt's important to find a therapist who is non-judgmental and understanding.

You might have believed that hiding your drinking was a way to maintain peace in the relationship.\n* **Protecting Your Comfort:** It's also possible that you were prioritizing your own desire to drink without facing judgment or confrontation. Hiding it might have allowed you to avoid difficult conversations and maintain a sense of control.\n\n* **Evolving Dynamics:** Relationships are dynamic, and motivations can shift over time. It's possible that your reasons for hiding your drinking changed as your relationship evolved.\n\n* **Honesty and Communication:** This experience might be prompting you to reflect on the level of honesty and communication in your marriage.

It's a reminder that your choices have ripple effects, impacting those you love most.\n\nHere's why your fear is significant and what you can do about it:\n\n* **Isolation vs. Connection:** Choosing alcohol over connection with your son signals a desire to withdraw, potentially deepening your isolation. While temporary comfort might be found in the bottle, it often leads to further loneliness in the long run.\n\n* **Honesty and Vulnerability:** Your son deserves honesty, even if it's difficult. Pretending everything is fine creates a facade that can damage trust and intimacy.\n\n* **Modeling Healthy Behavior:** Your son is observing your choices. By choosing connection over isolation, you're modeling healthy coping mechanisms and showing him the importance of relationships.\n\n* **Seeking Support:** Your fear is a sign that you recognize the need for change. Reaching out for support, whether through therapy, support groups, or trusted friends, can equip you with the tools to navigate this challenge.\n\n**Here are some steps you can take:**\n\n1. **Acknowledge your fear:** Don't dismiss it. Understand that it's rooted in a desire for connection and a fear of hurting your son.\n\n2. **Consider the consequences:** What are the long-term implications of choosing alcohol over your son? How will it impact your relationship with him?\n\n3. **Seek professional guidance:** A therapist can help you explore your feelings, develop coping strategies, and build healthier patterns.\n\n4. **Be honest with your son:** If you feel comfortable, consider talking to him about your struggles.

Avoiding the conversation suggests fear of judgment or rejection, which can lead to further isolation and strained relationships.\n\n* **The Risk of Assumptions:** By staying silent, you risk your son filling in the blanks with his own assumptions, which might be inaccurate or more negative than the truth.\n\n* **The Power of Honesty:**\n\nSharing your struggles with your son, in a way that feels safe and appropriate, can foster understanding and empathy. It shows him that you trust him and value his support.\n\n* **His Perspective:**\n\nWhile it's natural to fear his reaction, remember that he's likely more understanding and compassionate than you might think.
