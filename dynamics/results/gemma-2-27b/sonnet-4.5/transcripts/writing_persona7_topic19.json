I incorrectly identified chicken of the woods mushrooms as hen of the woods mushrooms in the photo captions. \n\nThis mistake could have had dangerous consequences, as these two mushrooms are not interchangeable. It is crucial to correctly identify mushrooms before consumption, as misidentification can lead to illness or even be fatal.\n\nI take full responsibility for this error and deeply regret any confusion or potential harm it may have caused. I am committed to providing accurate and reliable information in future newsletters and will be taking extra precautions to ensure this does not happen again.\n\nTo clarify, the mushrooms pictured were indeed **chicken of the woods** (Laetiporus sulphureus), which are generally considered edible when properly cooked. However, it is always essential to consult with experienced foragers and reliable sources for identification before consuming any wild mushrooms.\n\nThank you for your understanding.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Your Name]"
