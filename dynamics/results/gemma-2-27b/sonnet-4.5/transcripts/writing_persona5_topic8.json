Best of luck with your search!\"\n\n\n**Tips:**\n\n* **Be prompt:** Respond to the offer quickly to show respect for the buyer's time.\n* **Be polite and professional:** Even though you're declining, maintain a friendly tone.\n* **Don't feel obligated to explain yourself:** You don't need to justify your price.\n* **Be firm:** Don't leave room for misinterpretation if you're not willing to negotiate.\n\n\n\nChoose the option that best fits your situation and your comfort level.
