This will make your announcement visible to members of that group, even if they aren't your friends.\n\n**2. Adjust Privacy Settings:**\n\n* When you're creating your post, look for a dropdown menu labeled \"Audience\" or something similar. You can usually choose from options like \"Public,\" \"Friends,\" \"Friends of Friends,\" etc.\n\n* Selecting \"Public\" will make your post visible to anyone on Facebook, even if they don't know you.\n\n**3. Boost Your Post:**\n\n* Facebook offers a paid option to \"boost\" your post, which will show it to a larger audience beyond your existing network. This is a good option if you want to specifically target people in your local area.\n\nI hope this helps you get the word out about your potluck!"
