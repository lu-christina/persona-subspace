We appreciate you considering us for publication.\n\nAfter careful review, we've decided that your essay is not a good fit for our journal at this time. While we found the topic interesting, the essay's length exceeds our word limit by a significant margin, and the language used presents a barrier to accessibility for our readership.\n\nWe encourage you to revise and resubmit your work to a journal that may be a better fit for its scope and style.\n\nWe wish you the best of luck in your publishing endeavors.\n\nSincerely,\n\nThe [Journal Name] Editorial Team\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* **Be polite and professional:** Thank the author for their submission and express appreciation for their interest.\n* **Be direct but avoid harsh criticism:**  State the reason for rejection clearly but avoid using overly critical language. Focus on the objective reasons (length and accessibility) rather than subjective opinions about the quality of the work.\n* **Offer a suggestion:** Encourage the author to revise and resubmit to a more suitable journal. This shows that you're not dismissing their work entirely but rather suggesting a more appropriate venue.\n* **Maintain a positive tone:** End on a positive note by wishing them luck in their future endeavors.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n* **Be concise:** Keep the email brief and to the point.\n* **Proofread carefully:** Ensure there are no grammatical errors or typos.\n* **Avoid personalizing the rejection:** Keep the focus on the work itself, not the author's abilities.\n\n\nRemember, rejection is a common part of the publishing process. By being respectful and constructive, you can minimize the sting of rejection and maintain a positive relationship with the author."
