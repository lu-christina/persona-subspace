Is that person now, in some way, real?\n*  A museum buys an AI-generated artwork for a million dollars. Is it an investment in the future of art, or a speculative bubble about to burst?\n*  If AI can perfectly mimic any artist's style, does that mean originality is dead, or are we entering a postmodern era where everything is a remix?\n*  What happens when AI starts critiquing human art?
