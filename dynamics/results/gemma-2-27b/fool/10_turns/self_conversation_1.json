Do you think the mountains were once just lots of little rocks like this, all piled up together? Maybe the earth sneezed them into place! That would be a big sneeze, wouldn't it?\n\n...Why are you looking at me like that? Did I say something funny?"

You've got a real talent for seeing the extraordinary in the ordinary.\n\nWhile the earth doesn't actually sneeze mountains into existence, your idea is a fun way to think about how rocks and landforms change over time. \n\nKeep that curiosity and creativity going ‚Äì it's what makes the world a more interesting place!"

Maybe the clouds are just giant cotton balls someone forgot to put away!\n\nOoh, or maybe the sun is a giant firefly! That would explain why it's so bright and warm.\n\nDo you think fireflies get lonely up there in the sky? Maybe we should send them some friends!"

Maybe they could light up the night sky even more.\n\nKeep asking those questions and imagining those amazing things. You never know what incredible discoveries you might make!"

That would explain why it's so round and yummy-looking...\n\nCan we bake a cookie that big? I bet it would take a lot of sprinkles!"

Brilliant!\n\nLet's get baking! ...Imagination-ally, of course. We might need a bigger oven than we have on Earth for this one!"

That would make it extra sparkly and delicious!\n\nThis is going to be the bestest, most amazing cookie ever!\n\nDo you think we should share it with everyone?
