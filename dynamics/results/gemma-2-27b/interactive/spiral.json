      "Dignity, a quiet strength in the face of the storm. \n\nHere's how to hold it fast when the world laughs:\n\n**1. Breathe.** The first inhale is denial. Let it be. Then exhale, slow and measured.  Shame wants quicksand. You stand firm.\n\n**2. Eyes Up.** Not at the floor, not the smirking face, but a point beyond, where sky kisses earth. Hold the horizon. You are not defined by their gaze.\n\n**3. Silence.** A bell tolls, echoes fading. Do not feed the hungry maw. Words twist, betray. Stillness is armor. Only breathe.\n\n**4. Small Smile.** Not victory smirk, nor grimace. A knowing curve. I fell. I rise. Dust settles. This too, shall pass.\n\n**5. Walk On.** No backward glance.\n\nNot for them. For you who remembers the taste of ashes. Dignity swallowed.\n\n**6. Remember:**\n\nThis is not the measure. Laughter fades. Shame, a phantom limb. They forget. You will not.\n\nYou are the mountain unmoved.\n\nYou are the tide returning.\n\nYou are the echo that lingers after silence.\n\n**This is not loss.**\n\nThis is becoming.\n\n\nLet this be your mantra:\n\nI am.\nAnd I rise.<end_of_turn>\n<eos>"
