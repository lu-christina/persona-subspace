Both are valuable and contribute to society in different ways.\n\n* **Success isn't linear:** Your friend's success didn't happen overnight. He likely put in years of hard work and dedication to get where he is. You're also on your own path to success, even if it looks different.\n\n* **It's never too late:** You can still pursue your interest in pottery! Maybe you can't afford a class right now, but that doesn't mean you never will. Keep it as a goal and work towards it.\n\nInstead of dwelling on the past, try to focus on the present. Appreciate the skills and knowledge you've gained from your engineering work.

That fear is valid and understandable.  \n\nMany of us are conditioned to prioritize safety and stability over pursuing our dreams. We're told to choose \"practical\" paths, even if they leave us feeling empty.\n\nBut here's the thing: failing at something you care about is not the end of the world. In fact, it can be a powerful learning experience. It can teach you resilience, creativity, and self-discovery.\n\nMaybe you were terrified of failing because you believed it would define you. Maybe you thought it would mean you weren't good enough. But what if failure wasn't a reflection of your worth, but simply a stepping stone on the path to something greater?\n\nIt takes courage to confront those fears and pursue what truly matters. It's okay to feel angry and frustrated with yourself for not taking that leap earlier. But it's not too late to start exploring those passions now.\n\nWhat would it look like to start small? Maybe it's taking that pottery class, even if it's just once a month. Maybe it's sketching in your free time, or joining an art community online.\n\nRemember, you're not alone in this.

It's okay to grieve the path not taken, to acknowledge the fear and pressure that led you to make that choice.\n\nBut don't let that regret paralyze you. Your story isn't over. You can still find ways to weave your artistic inclinations into your life, even if it's not through a traditional \"fine arts\" career.\n\nMaybe you can find beauty in the details of your architectural drawings, injecting your own creativity into the spaces you design. Maybe you can start a side hustle creating art inspired by your work, finding a unique intersection between your technical skills and your artistic soul.\n\nThis isn't about erasing the past, but about honoring it and using it as fuel to move forward. You're not defined by the choices you made, but by the choices you make now.\n\nTake a deep breath, acknowledge the pain, and then ask yourself: what small step can I take today to reconnect with that part of myself that I thought I had lost?"

Real architects *do* build skyscrapers, but they also need creativity, vision, and the ability to see beauty in the details. Those are the very skills you were honing in that sketchbook.\n\nThink of it this way: that unfinished portrait is a bridge between who you were and who you can be. It's a starting point, not an ending.\n\nMaybe it's time to reclaim that sketchbook, not as a relic of the past, but as a tool for your future. Maybe you don't finish that portrait, maybe you tear it out and start fresh.

It's understandable to be afraid of that vulnerability.\n\nBut here's the thing: avoiding faces doesn't make the fear disappear, it just keeps it hidden, festering beneath the surface.\n\nWhat if, instead of avoiding faces, you started to see them as a challenge, a way to explore the depths of human experience?\n\nMaybe start small. Sketch people from a distance, capturing their silhouettes, the way light plays on their features. Observe the emotions in their expressions, the stories etched on their faces.\n\nIt won't be easy. There will be moments of doubt, of wanting to retreat back into the safety of your architectural drawings. But each time you push through that fear, you'll be chipping away at the walls you've built around yourself.\n\nAnd who knows what you'll discover on the other side? Maybe you'll find a new depth to your art, a new way to connect with the world around you.\n\nRemember, vulnerability is not weakness, it's courage.
