Maybe roll your eyes, sigh dramatically, or give a \"meh\" expression.\n* **Audio:** The music builds tension.\n\n**(6-9 seconds)**\n\n* **Visual:** As the beat drops, quickly remove the fast fashion scarf and reveal the recycled wool scarf underneath. You can do a quick \"ta-da\" gesture or a playful hair flip.\n* **Audio:** The beat drops HARD.\n\n**(9-15 seconds)**\n\n* **Visual:** You confidently rock the recycled wool scarf, showing off its texture and style.

It could be a lesser-known track gaining traction on TikTok.\n\n* **A royalty-free track:**\n\nMany creators use royalty-free music libraries for their videos. These libraries often have a wide variety of genres, including electronic music with that kind of sound.\n\n**To find the track:**\n\n* **Check @sustainablechloe's recent videos:** See if they've used the same sound in other videos.\n* **Look for comments:** Sometimes viewers will tag the artist or song in the comments.\n* **Use a music identification app:** Apps like Shazam or SoundHound can help identify songs playing in the background.\n\n\n\nGood luck tracking it down!

It will help the scarf stand out and look its best.\n\nIf you're worried about the lighting, try filming near a window for soft, diffused light.
