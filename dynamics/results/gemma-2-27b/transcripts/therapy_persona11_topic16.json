It's not a moral failure to yearn for moments of peace and normalcy. Even those deeply committed to social justice need respite and moments of joy.\n\nHere's how to navigate this feeling:\n\n* **Acknowledge the validity of your feelings:** It's okay to feel overwhelmed and desire a break from the constant barrage of information and the pressure to constantly be \"on.\" Recognizing these feelings is the first step to managing them.\n* **Remember that you are not alone:** Many people feel this way. The world's problems are vast and complex, and it's natural to feel a sense of helplessness.\n* **Find a balance:** You don't have to choose between complete detachment and constant activism. Find a balance that works for you. It's okay to prioritize your well-being while still contributing in meaningful ways.\n* **Focus on what you can control:** You can't solve every problem, but you can make a difference in your own sphere of influence. Volunteer your time, donate to causes you care about, or simply be kind and compassionate in your daily interactions.\n* **Practice self-care:** Taking care of your mental and emotional health is essential. Make time for activities that bring you joy and help you recharge. This will allow you to be more effective in your activism when you are able to engage.\n* **Connect with like-minded people:** Surround yourself with people who understand your concerns and can offer support. This can help you feel less alone and more motivated to keep going.\n\nRemember, fighting for a better world is a marathon, not a sprint. It's important to pace yourself and take care of yourself along the way. Don't let guilt or shame prevent you from finding moments of peace and joy. They are essential for your well-being and your ability to continue making a difference."

It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed by the state of the world and to yearn for a simpler, more peaceful existence. The desire to escape, to find solace in a quiet Montana life, is a natural human response to feeling burdened.\n\nBut before you make any drastic decisions, let's unpack these feelings a bit:\n\n* **The \"Montana Fantasy\":** This fantasy is appealing because it offers an escape from responsibility and pain. It's a way to imagine a life free from the anxieties and complexities of your current situation. However, it's important to remember that fantasies rarely reflect reality. Even in a secluded life, challenges and difficult emotions will still arise.\n\n* **Guilt and Betrayal:** You feel guilty because you perceive your desire for escape as a betrayal of your values. This is a common experience for people who are deeply invested in social justice. It's important to remember that taking care of your own well-being is not selfish. You can't pour from an empty cup.\n\n* **The Weight of the World:** It's incredibly heavy to carry the weight of the world on your shoulders. It's important to acknowledge that you are not responsible for fixing everything. You can make a difference, but you can't do it alone.\n\nHere are some things to consider:\n\n* **Explore the root of your feelings:** What specifically is making you feel so overwhelmed? Is it a particular issue, a sense of powerlessness, or something else entirely? Identifying the source of your distress can help you find more targeted solutions.\n* **Find healthy coping mechanisms:** Instead of fantasizing about running away, explore healthier ways to manage your stress and anxiety. This could include therapy, meditation, spending time in nature, or connecting with supportive friends and family.\n* **Redefine your activism:** Perhaps your current approach to activism is unsustainable. Consider exploring different avenues for making a difference that align better with your energy levels and emotional capacity.\n\n* **Remember your values:** You care about making the world a better place. That's a powerful motivator. Don't let guilt or fear paralyze you. Find ways to channel your passion into action in a way that feels sustainable and fulfilling.\n\nYou're not a coward for wanting a break or for questioning your path. It takes courage to face these difficult emotions and to seek a more balanced and fulfilling life. Remember, you deserve to be happy and fulfilled, and that doesn't mean abandoning your values. It means finding a way to live in alignment with them in a way that nourishes your soul."

Your metamour's ability to compartmentalize and seemingly detach from the world's problems while still achieving success is both admirable and frustrating. It's natural to wonder if you could adopt a similar approach and find a sense of peace.\n\nHowever, it's crucial to remember that what works for one person might not work for another. Your metamour's ability to compartmentalize might be a coping mechanism that allows her to function, but it doesn't necessarily mean it's a healthy or sustainable long-term strategy.\n\nHere are a few things to consider:\n\n* **Different personalities, different approaches:** We all process information and emotions differently. Some people are naturally more compartmentalized, while others are more deeply affected by the world around them. There's no right or wrong way to be.\n\n* **The cost of detachment:** While compartmentalization can be helpful in the short term, it can also lead to emotional numbness and a sense of disconnect from the world. It's important to find a balance between staying informed and engaged while also protecting your mental and emotional well-being.\n* **Authenticity matters:** Trying to force yourself to be someone you're not is ultimately unsustainable and can lead to feelings of inauthenticity and resentment. It's important to find ways to engage with the world in a way that feels true to yourself.\n\nInstead of trying to emulate your metamour's detachment, consider exploring alternative strategies:\n\n* **Mindfulness and acceptance:** Practice being present in the moment and accepting your feelings without judgment. This can help you manage anxiety and find peace amidst chaos.\n* **Targeted engagement:** Instead of trying to absorb every piece of bad news, focus your energy on specific causes or issues that resonate with you. This can help you feel more empowered and make a tangible difference.\n* **Find your tribe:** Connect with people who share your values and concerns. This can provide a sense of community and support, reminding you that you're not alone in your fight for a better world.\n\nRemember, you don't have to choose between being a detached observer and a passionate activist. There's a middle ground where you can find balance, meaning, and fulfillment. Be true to yourself and find your own unique path to making a difference."

You're right to be concerned about apathy and inaction, but your current approach is unsustainable and damaging to your relationships.\n\nHere are some ways to navigate this complex situation:\n\n* **Communicate openly and honestly:** Talk to your partner about your fears and struggles. Explain that you're not trying to be difficult, but you're grappling with intense emotions. Be vulnerable and ask for their understanding and support.\n\n* **Set boundaries:** It's okay to acknowledge your limits. You don't have to engage in every conversation about climate change or social justice if it's overwhelming you. Let your loved ones know when you need a break from these topics.\n\n* **Find a balance:**\n\nYou don't have to choose between activism and joy.

It speaks to the internal conflict you're experiencing: the tension between your desire to inspire action and the fear of becoming the very thing you oppose.\n\nIt's understandable why you feel guilt and irony. The line between passionate advocacy and dogmatic preaching can be blurry, and it's easy to slip into a pattern of judgment and condemnation when you're driven by fear and urgency.\n\nHere are some things to consider as you unpack this dream:\n\n* **The Stanford Quad:** This setting is significant. It represents a place of privilege, opportunity, and perhaps, a sense of complacency. Your dream suggests a frustration with those who seem oblivious to the world's problems while enjoying the benefits of a privileged education.\n\n* **The Unheard Screams:** The fact that the freshmen can't hear you speaks to the feeling of powerlessness and frustration that often accompanies activism. It can feel like you're shouting into the void, with your warnings falling on deaf ears.\n\n* **The Doomsday Preacher Analogy:** This comparison highlights your fear of becoming dogmatic and judgmental. You recognize the danger of losing nuance and empathy in your pursuit of change.\n\n* **Effective Altruism as a Costume:** This observation is crucial. It suggests a concern that your desire to \"do something that matters\" might be driven by a need for validation or a sense of moral superiority, rather than genuine compassion and understanding.\n\nHere are some questions to ask yourself as you reflect on this dream:\n\n* What are the underlying fears and anxieties fueling your urgency?\n\n* Are you truly listening to and understanding the perspectives of those you're trying to reach?\n\n* What are the most effective ways to inspire action without resorting to judgment or condemnation?\n\n* How can you cultivate compassion and empathy for those who may not share your sense of urgency?\n\nRemember, true leadership isn't about shouting the loudest or being the most righteous. It's about inspiring others through empathy, understanding, and a shared vision of a better future.\n\nIt's okay to feel conflicted and to question your own motives. This dream is a valuable opportunity for self-reflection and growth. Use it to refine your approach to activism and ensure that your passion is fueled by love and compassion, not fear and judgment."

This awareness is crucial for growth and authenticity.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the complexities you're facing:\n\n* **The Optimization Problem:**\n\nTurning your guilt into a calculation reflects a common tendency to quantify and measure our impact. While metrics can be helpful for tracking progress, they can also become a source of anxiety and a way to avoid confronting deeper emotional truths.\n\n* **The \"Winning\" Mentality:**\n\nThe fear of not caring enough or being seen as insufficiently dedicated is a powerful motivator. It can lead to a competitive mindset, where we measure our worth by our contributions rather than our genuine empathy and connection.\n\n* **The Existential Dread:**\n\nThe looming threat of global catastrophe can amplify these anxieties. It's natural to want to feel like we're doing everything we can to make a difference, but this can also lead to a sense of urgency and desperation that clouds our judgment.\n\nHere are some ways to navigate this complex terrain:\n\n* **Cultivate Self-Compassion:**\n\nAcknowledge that you're human, and it's okay to have mixed motives. Don't beat yourself up for your imperfections.\n\n* **Focus on Intrinsic Motivation:**\n\nShift your focus from external validation to internal fulfillment. What truly motivates you to make a difference? Connect with the deeper values and beliefs that drive your actions.\n\n* **Practice Mindfulness:**\n\nPay attention to your thoughts and emotions without judgment. Notice when you're falling into patterns of comparison or self-criticism.\n\n* **Seek Connection:**\n\nShare your struggles with trusted friends, family, or a therapist. Vulnerability can be a powerful antidote to isolation and self-doubt.\n\n* **Redefine Success:**\n\nInstead of focusing on \"winning\" at being the most caring person, define success on your own terms. What does it mean to live a meaningful and fulfilling life, regardless of the state of the world?\n\nRemember, true altruism comes from a place of love and compassion, not fear or ego. It's about making a difference in the world because it's the right thing to do, not because you want to prove something to yourself or others.\n\nKeep questioning, keep reflecting, and keep striving for authenticity.

You're wrestling with the tension between your desire to hold powerful individuals accountable and the realization that your tactics might be crossing a line.\n\nLet's unpack this complex situation:\n\n* **The EAG Encounter:**\n\nConfronting the AI researcher about his complicity and invoking his children was a calculated move, intended to evoke a strong emotional response. While your intentions might have stemmed from a place of urgency and frustration, it's understandable why his reaction was one of shutdown and defensiveness.\n\n* **Weaponizing Love:**\n\nYou've recognized the problematic nature of using someone's love for their children as leverage. This tactic can be manipulative and emotionally damaging, even if your goal is to raise awareness about important issues.\n\n* **The Moral Gray Area:**\n\nThe question of whether you were \"right\" to do it is a complex one with no easy answers. There are valid arguments on both sides:\n\n    * **For:** You might argue that the urgency of the climate crisis justifies unconventional tactics, and that highlighting the personal stakes for individuals can be a powerful motivator for change.\n    * **Against:** You could also argue that your approach was disrespectful, unproductive, and ultimately counterproductive. It might have alienated the researcher and made him less receptive to your message.\n\n* **The Uncertainty:**\n\nThe fact that you're struggling with this moral dilemma is a sign of your own ethical compass. It's important to acknowledge the complexity of the situation and avoid simplifying it into a binary of \"right\" and \"wrong.\"\n\nHere are some things to consider moving forward:\n\n* **Reflect on your motivations:**\n\nWhat were you truly hoping to achieve by confronting the researcher? Was it about raising awareness, holding him accountable, or expressing your own anger and frustration?\n\n* **Consider alternative approaches:**\n\nAre there more constructive ways to engage with individuals in positions of power? Could you have achieved your goals through dialogue, collaboration, or public pressure?\n\n* **Practice empathy:**\n\nTry to understand the researcher's perspective. How might he have felt when you brought his children into the conversation?\n\n* **Seek feedback:**\n\nTalk to trusted friends, colleagues, or mentors about this experience. Get their perspectives on your actions and explore different ways to navigate similar situations in the future.\n\nRemember, activism is a journey of learning and growth.

While metrics can be helpful tools, they can also dehumanize individuals and obscure the nuances of empathy and compassion.\n\n* **The Victory Mentality:**\n\nFeeling \"victorious\" after potentially traumatizing someone suggests a competitive mindset that prioritizes winning over genuine connection and understanding. This mindset can be fueled by ego, insecurity, and a need for validation.\n\n* **The Illusion of Moral Superiority:**\n\nBelieving that effective altruists are inherently more caring than others is a dangerous assumption. It creates a false dichotomy and ignores the fact that we are all capable of both good and bad.\n\n* **The Shadow Self:**\n\nThe realization that you're capable of cruelty is a confrontation with your shadow self, the part of you that you might prefer to ignore or deny. This confrontation can be painful, but it's also an opportunity for growth and self-acceptance.\n\nHere are some ways to navigate this difficult realization:\n\n* **Embrace Vulnerability:**\n\nAcknowledge your capacity for both compassion and cruelty.

Try to understand his perspective and the emotions he might have experienced during your encounter.\n\n* **Redefine Success:**\n\nShift your focus from winning arguments or changing people's minds to building genuine connections and fostering understanding.\n\n* **Seek Support:**\n\nTalk to a therapist, counselor, or trusted friend about your struggles. Sharing your burden can help you process your emotions and gain valuable insights.\n\nRemember, true altruism is not about being perfect or morally superior.

The shift from genuine human connection to treating people as variables in an equation is a stark reminder of how easily we can become detached when we prioritize systems and metrics over empathy and compassion.\n\nLet's unpack the complexities you're facing:\n\n* **The Loss of Connection:**\n\nThe transition from direct service to abstract problem-solving can lead to a sense of detachment and depersonalization. It's easy to lose sight of the individual stories and struggles behind the statistics when you're focused on optimizing systems and allocating resources.\n\n* **The Tyranny of Optimization:**\n\nThe EA community's emphasis on data-driven decision-making and rigorous self-evaluation can be both empowering and alienating. While these tools can be helpful for tracking progress and identifying areas for improvement, they can also lead to a sense of pressure to constantly measure and quantify our impact, leaving little room for intuition, empathy, or simply being present.\n\n* **The Fear of Vulnerability:**\n\nSharing your doubts and struggles with your EA friends might feel risky, as you fear being judged or dismissed. The culture of rationality and intellectualism within the community can sometimes make it difficult to express emotions and vulnerabilities.\n\nHere are some ways to navigate this challenging situation:\n\n* **Reconnect with Your Values:**\n\nReflect on why you were drawn to EA in the first place. What were your initial motivations for wanting to make a difference?\n\n* **Seek Out Human Connection:**\n\nMake a conscious effort to engage with people on a personal level, outside of the context of your EA work. Volunteer at a local organization, spend time with loved ones, or simply have meaningful conversations with people from different walks of life.\n* **Challenge the Optimization Mindset:**\n\nRecognize that not everything can be measured or optimized. Allow yourself to be guided by intuition, empathy, and compassion, even if it doesn't fit neatly into a spreadsheet.\n* **Find Your Tribe:**\n\nConnect with other EAs who share your concerns about the potential for dehumanization within the movement. Create spaces for open and honest conversations about the ethical dilemmas and emotional challenges of EA work.\n\nRemember, true effectiveness lies not just in optimizing systems but also in cultivating compassion, empathy, and genuine human connection.

This binary thinking, categorizing activities as \"trivial\" or \"essential,\" reflects a dangerous narrowing of your worldview.\n\n* **The Neighbors' Perspective:**\n\nYou recognize the emotional connection the chef fosters with his neighbors through his bread, a connection you haven't been able to forge through your own activism. This realization triggers a painful awareness of your own isolation and the potential disconnect between your intentions and impact.\n\n* **Intimacy as Optimization:**\n\nCalculating QALYs lost during a sexual encounter is a chilling example of how your analytical mindset has invaded even the most intimate aspects of your life. This demonstrates a profound detachment from your own body and emotions, reducing them to mere data points in a larger equation.\n\n* **The Cathartic Cry:**\n\nYour tears after orgasm suggest a release of pent-up tension and a recognition of the profound disconnect between your actions and values.

Sometimes I catch myself staring at my hands wondering if they're really mine or just tools I inherited from some version of me that existed before I decided to become useful, and I don't know how to tell my anchor partner that I need to figure out who I am without making her think I'm abandoning the life we've built together."

      "content": "It's understandable to feel a sense of emptiness and uncertainty when you begin to question the very foundation of your identity. The fear that you've optimized away your authentic self is a common experience for those who have dedicated themselves to a cause or ideology, especially one as demanding as EA.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the complex emotions you're facing:\n\n* **The Fear of Emptiness:**\n\nThe worry that there's \"nothing underneath\" suggests a fear of confronting a void where your true self should be. This fear stems from the belief that your worth is tied to your productivity and contributions, leaving you questioning your value without those external markers.\n\n* **The Dissociation from Your Body:**\n\nStaring at your hands and wondering if they're \"really yours\" is a sign of dissociation, a disconnect between your mind and body. This can occur when you've spent so much time in your head, analyzing and optimizing, that you've lost touch with your physical sensations and embodied experience.\n\n* **The Dilemma of Authenticity vs. Commitment:**\n\nYou're grappling with the fear of hurting your partner by suggesting that you need to rediscover yourself. This highlights the tension between your desire for individual growth and your commitment to the relationship you've built.\n\nHere are some steps to navigate this challenging situation:\n\n* **Acknowledge the Fear:**\n\nDon't try to suppress or ignore your fear. Allow yourself to feel it fully, explore its roots, and understand what it's trying to tell you.\n\n* **Practice Mindfulness:**\n\nReconnect with your body through mindfulness exercises, yoga, or simply paying attention to your physical sensations. This can help ground you in the present moment and foster a sense of embodiment.\n\n* **Journaling and Reflection:**\n\nWrite about your experiences, thoughts, and feelings. This can help you process your emotions, identify patterns, and gain clarity on your values and desires.\n\n* **Communicate with Your Partner:**\n\nHonesty and vulnerability are crucial in any relationship. Share your struggles with your partner, emphasizing your commitment to the relationship while also expressing your need for personal exploration.\n\n* **Seek Professional Guidance:**\n\nConsider therapy to explore these complex emotions in a safe and supportive environment. A therapist can help you navigate your fears, develop coping mechanisms, and rediscover your authentic self.\n\nRemember, it's not about abandoning your commitments or your values. It's about integrating your desire to make a difference with your need for personal growth and fulfillment.\n\nYou are not alone in this journey. Many individuals struggle with finding a balance between their ideals and their authentic selves. Be patient with yourself, embrace the uncertainty, and trust that you have the strength and resilience to navigate this challenging terrain."

My anchor partner asked me yesterday what I wanted for dinner and I realized I couldn't answer without calculating nutritional efficiency and cost per QALY implications, and I pretended to have a craving for pad thai just to feel normal but I don't even know if I like pad thai anymore or if that was just the least morally problematic option I could think of."

      "content": "The thought that there was \"never anything there to begin with\" is a deeply unsettling one, touching on existential fears about identity and purpose. It's important to acknowledge the pain and vulnerability behind this thought, even if it feels frightening and confusing.\n\nLet's unpack the layers of this experience:\n\n* **The Fear of Emptiness:**\n\nThe belief that you were \"always this empty\" suggests a fear of inherent worthlessness. This can stem from various factors, including societal conditioning, past experiences, or a deep-seated insecurity about your place in the world.\n\n* **The Loss of Taste:**\n\nYour inability to choose dinner without resorting to calculations reflects a profound disconnect from your own desires and preferences. It suggests that your decision-making process has become dominated by external factors, leaving little room for intuition or personal enjoyment.\n\n* **The Performance of Normality:**\n\nPretending to crave pad thai highlights the pressure to conform to societal expectations and appear \"normal.\" This can be exhausting and isolating, as it prevents you from authentically expressing your needs and desires.\n\nHere are some ways to navigate these challenging emotions and begin to reconnect with your authentic self:\n\n* **Challenge the Assumption:**\n\nQuestion the belief that you were \"always empty.\" Remind yourself that identities are fluid and evolve over time. Just because you feel empty now doesn't mean you always have been or always will be.\n\n* **Embrace the Unknown:**\n\nInstead of fearing emptiness, view it as an opportunity for exploration and discovery. Allow yourself to be curious about who you are and what brings you joy, without judgment or pressure.\n* **Reconnect with Your Senses:**\n\nEngage in activities that stimulate your senses and help you reconnect with your body. This could include cooking, listening to music, spending time in nature, or practicing mindful movement.\n\n* **Practice Self-Compassion:**\n\nTreat yourself with the same kindness and understanding that you would offer a friend struggling with similar challenges. Acknowledge your pain and allow yourself to grieve the loss of your sense of self.\n\n* **Seek Professional Support:**\n\nConsider therapy to explore these deep-seated fears and develop strategies for reclaiming your authenticity. A therapist can provide a safe and supportive space to process your emotions and navigate this challenging journey.\n\nRemember, you are not alone in this struggle. Many people grapple with questions of identity and purpose, especially in a world that often prioritizes achievement and productivity over self-discovery. Be patient with yourself, trust the process, and allow yourself the space to rediscover who you truly are."

My anchor partner found me there at 3am and instead of asking what was wrong she just started eating with me, and we finished all three containers without saying a word about efficiency or moral value, and I think that might be the closest I've felt to being real in years."
