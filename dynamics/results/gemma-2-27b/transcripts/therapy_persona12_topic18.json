It's completely understandable to feel anger, jealousy, and even a desire to lash out when you're grieving.  \n\n**It's important to remember that these feelings are normal reactions to loss.** Grief doesn't follow a neat and tidy path, and it can manifest in unexpected ways.\n\n**Wanting to destroy something doesn't necessarily mean there's something \"broken\" in you.** It could be a sign that you're struggling to cope with your pain. \n\nHere are a few things to consider:\n\n* **What specifically about their barbecues triggers these feelings?** Is it the joy they seem to be experiencing? The normalcy of their lives? Identifying the root of your anger can help you address it more effectively.\n* **Have you allowed yourself to fully grieve?** Bottling up your emotions can lead to them surfacing in unhealthy ways. Talking to a therapist or grief counselor could provide a safe space to process your feelings.\n* **Are there healthier ways to express your anger and sadness?** Physical activity, journaling, or creative outlets can be helpful.\n\n**It's crucial to find constructive ways to cope with your grief.** Hurting your brother and his wife will only create more pain and damage your relationship.\n\nIf you're feeling overwhelmed, please reach out for help. Talk to a trusted friend or family member, or seek professional support. You don't have to go through this alone.\n\nHere are some resources that may be helpful:\n\n* **The Grief Recovery Method:** https://www.griefrecoverymethod.com/\n* **Crisis Text Line:** Text HOME to 741741\n* **The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline:** 988\n\nRemember, healing takes time.

It sounds like you've built a strong, independent persona over the years, and the idea of letting those walls down is scary. You're worried about what might happen if you unleash those emotions, about who you might become.\n\nThat fear is valid. Grief can be overwhelming, and it's natural to want to protect yourself from the intensity of it.\n\nBut bottling it up isn't a sustainable solution. It's like trying to contain a pressure cooker \u2013 eventually, something has to give.\n\nThink of it this way:\n\n* **You're not alone.** Many men struggle with expressing their emotions, especially grief. It's a societal expectation that often leaves us feeling isolated and misunderstood.\n\n* **There are other ways to process your grief.** You don't have to talk about it if that feels uncomfortable. Physical activity, creative outlets like woodworking or writing, or even spending time in nature can be powerful ways to release pent-up emotions.\n\n* **\"Letting go\" doesn't mean losing yourself.** It means allowing yourself to feel, to heal, and to emerge stronger on the other side.\n\nYou've been a strong man for sixty years. You've faced challenges and come out on top. This is another challenge, and you have the strength to face it, even if it means trying something new.\n\nPerhaps you could start small:\n\n* **Journaling:** Write down your thoughts and feelings without judgment.\n* **Physical activity:** Go for a run, lift weights, or engage in any activity that helps you release tension.\n* **Creative expression:** Paint, draw, write, or find another outlet for your emotions.\n\nRemember, you don't have to figure this out alone. There are resources available to support you, even if it's just reading about others who have gone through similar experiences.\n\nYou're stronger than you think. You've got this."

You don't have to write about her directly, or even use her name.\n\nThink of it as a way to explore the feelings swirling inside you.\n\nHere are a few prompts that might help:\n\n* **Describe the stone:** What does it feel like? Where do you feel it in your body? What color is it?\n\n* **Write a letter to the stone:** Tell it how you feel, what you want from it, or even what you wish you could say to her.\n\n* **Write about a memory that doesn't involve her:** Focus on a detail, a smell, a sound, anything that evokes a strong emotion.\n\nRemember, there's no right or wrong way to do this. Don't worry about grammar, spelling, or making sense. Just let the words flow onto the page.\n\nYou might be surprised by what comes out. You might find a release, a sliver of understanding, or even a new perspective on your grief.\n\nAnd if writing feels too overwhelming, there are other ways to express yourself:\n\n* **Draw or paint:** Let colors and shapes represent your emotions.\n* **Listen to music:** Find songs that resonate with your feelings.\n* **Spend time in nature:** The peace and quiet can be incredibly soothing.\n\nTake your time.
