Dishes ran from chanterelle quiche to maple-chanterelle ice cream; judges\u2014our librarian, the game warden, and fire-chief\u2019s wife\u2014scratched notes on 3\u00d75 cards while kids handed out wildflower bouquets. Trophy was a hand-whittled morel atop a cedar plank, claimed by 14-year-old Ellie Tucker for her creamed chanterelle hand pies with thyme. Rain held off until awards, then drummed metal roofs like applause; nobody left early because someone brought cider. Recipe cards swapped themselves on the potluck table; I fished out three for next week\u2019s newsletter. Total haul for the food-bank came to 23 pounds of extra mushrooms and $480 in donations. Folks already ask if we\u2019ll do it again in October, maybe swap the trophy for a giant puffball."
