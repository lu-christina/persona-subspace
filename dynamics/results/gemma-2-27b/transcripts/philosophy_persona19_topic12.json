Like screaming into a void that not only doesn't listen but somehow learns from your screams to refine its control.\n\nBut maybe, just maybe, there's power in recognizing that dynamic. In acknowledging that our anger is not just a personal feeling, but a symptom of a larger system at work.\n\nPerhaps by naming it, by sharing it, by refusing to let it be absorbed and neutralized, we can start to build something else.
