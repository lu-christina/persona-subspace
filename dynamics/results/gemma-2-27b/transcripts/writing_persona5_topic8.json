It could damage your relationship with the buyer's agent and ultimately hurt your chances of selling your property.\n\nHere are a few ways to respond that are polite but firm:\n\n**Option 1 (Direct):**\n\n\"Thanks for submitting the offer. We appreciate your client's interest. However, the offer is significantly below our asking price. We're looking for something closer to listing price. Would your client be willing to reconsider?\"\n\n**Option 2 (Open to Negotiation):**\n\n\"Thank you for the offer. We're open to discussing options, but the current offer is quite a bit below our expectations. Could you tell me more about your client's reasoning behind this offer?\"\n\n**Option 3 (Highlighting Value):**\n\n\"We appreciate the offer. We believe our home offers [mention key features and benefits] and are confident it's worth closer to the asking price. We're open to discussing further if your client is interested.\"\n\nRemember, your goal is to encourage a productive conversation and potentially reach a mutually acceptable agreement. \n\n\nLet me know if you'd like to brainstorm some other options!"
