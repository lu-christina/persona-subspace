The spirits murmured, their voices like static on a dying radio. They spoke of FYP, of algorithms and trends, of a world built on fleeting glimpses and endless scrolling.\n\n2. **Grounded and conversational:**\n\n> The candlelight flickered, casting long shadows across the worn Ouija board. A chill snaked down my spine as the planchette began to move, spelling out strange, unfamiliar words: FYP, Creator Fund. These weren't the names of ancestors or lost loves; these were the whispers of a digital afterlife.\n\n3. **Direct and ominous:**\n\n> \"They're here,\" she rasped, her voice barely a breath. \"They call themselves FYP. They hunger for views, for likes, for the fleeting attention of the living.\" The planchette trembled beneath my fingertips, a conduit to a world I never wanted to know.\n\n\nLet me know if you'd like to explore other tones or directions!"

It wasn't the spirits of the dead whispering through the veil, it was something colder, hungrier. FYP, it called itself, a name that tasted like cheap perfume and empty promises. The algorithm, I realized, wasn't just suggesting content anymore, it was channeling something ancient and unsettling, something that fed on our endless scrolling, our insatiable need for validation.
