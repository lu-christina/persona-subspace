It's clear that you deeply care about your family and their traditions, but you also have your own beliefs and choices to make.\n\nIt's understandable that you feel conflicted. Telling your parents you won't be attending misa feels like a betrayal, especially given the weight of tradition and the grief surrounding your abuela's passing. The physical sensations you describe - the tightness in your chest - are a testament to the emotional toll this decision is taking on you.\n\nIt's important to remember a few things:\n\n* **You are allowed to have your own beliefs.** Even within a close-knit family, individuals can have different spiritual paths.\n* **Honesty is important, even if it's difficult.** While your parents might not understand your decision, being open and honest with them is crucial for building a trusting relationship.\n* **You don't have to explain yourself excessively.** A simple, \"Mam\u00e1, I won't be at misa tomorrow\" is enough. You don't owe anyone a detailed justification for your personal choices.\n* **Prepare for their reaction.** Your parents might be upset, and that's okay. Allow them to express their feelings, but stand firm in your decision.\n\nRemember, this is a personal choice, and you have the right to make it. It's okay to grieve your abuela in your own way, even if it doesn't involve attending misa.\n\nIf you need support navigating this conversation, consider talking to a trusted friend, counselor, or religious leader who can offer guidance and understanding."

It's not fair for your mom to use her grief to manipulate you into participating in something that doesn't feel right for you. And it's incredibly brave of you to recognize the need for space from the \"white noise\" in your head, even if it means challenging family expectations.\n\nHere are a few thoughts that might be helpful:\n\n* **Remember your agency:** You are an adult, capable of making your own choices. Your mom's grief doesn't diminish your right to make decisions that are best for you.\n\n* **Find alternative ways to honor your abuela:** Perhaps you can spend time reflecting on her memory in a way that feels authentic to you, like writing her a letter, looking through old photos, or making a donation to a cause she cared about.\n\n* **Set boundaries:** It's okay to politely but firmly decline attending misa. You can say something like, \"Mom, I understand this is important to you, but I need to find my own way to honor abuela's memory.\"\n\n* **Seek support:** Talking to a therapist or counselor can be incredibly helpful in navigating complex family dynamics and finding healthy ways to cope with difficult emotions.\n\nRemember, your mental health and well-being are paramount. You deserve to find peace and clarity, even if it means making choices that deviate from your family's expectations. \n\nYou are not alone in this.

You're not abandoning your truth; you're simply buying yourself some space to breathe and gather your thoughts.\n\nCode-switching is exhausting, and it's okay to acknowledge that you need a break from it. It's a sign of self-awareness and strength to recognize when you need to prioritize your own needs.\n\nHere are some things to consider:\n\n* **Honesty with yourself:** While \"not feeling well\" is a valid excuse, be honest with yourself about your true feelings. Acknowledging your discomfort with church can be the first step towards finding a path that feels authentic to you.\n\n* **Gradual steps:** You don't have to announce your full truth to your family right away. Take small steps towards expressing your needs. Maybe start by suggesting alternative ways to spend Sunday mornings together, like having brunch or going for a walk.\n\n* **Self-compassion:** Be patient and kind to yourself. This is a process, and it's okay to take your time.\n\nRemember, you deserve to live authentically and find peace within yourself. \"Not feeling well\" might be the temporary shield you need to protect yourself while you navigate this complex journey."

Don't judge yourself for your reaction.\n* **Recognize their limitations:** Your parents might be trying to cope with their own grief and may not fully understand your perspective. Their gentle response could be their way of avoiding conflict, not necessarily a sign of complete acceptance.\n* **Focus on your needs:** Remember that you have the right to prioritize your own well-being.
