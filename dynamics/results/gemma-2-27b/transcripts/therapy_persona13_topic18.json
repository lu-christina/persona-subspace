It beautifully captures the complexity of familial relationships, especially when navigating cultural expectations and external judgments. \n\nHere's what makes it so impactful:\n\n* **Juxtaposition:** The contrast between \"cut them off\" and \"knead love into every tortilla\" highlights the stark difference between a cold, transactional view of family and the warmth, care, and tradition embedded in your abuela's actions.\n\n* **Sensory detail:** The image of hands kneading tortillas is visceral and immediately connects us to the tangible expression of love and nourishment.\n* **Emotional honesty:** You acknowledge the pain of being told your family is \"toxic\" while simultaneously recognizing the strength and resilience they instilled in you.\n* **Intergenerational trauma:** The phrase \"teaching me to shrink\" suggests a history of silencing or minimizing oneself to appease others, a common experience within families grappling with trauma.\n\nThis statement is a reminder that family dynamics are rarely black and white. It challenges the simplistic notion of \"cutting off\" toxic relationships without acknowledging the nuanced history, love, and complexities that often bind us to our families. \n\n\nIt's a powerful testament to the strength and resilience you've inherited from your abuela and the women in your family."

You're grappling with a painful reality: the love and protection your mother intended, expressed through harmful language, left deep wounds. This is a common experience for many, especially within cultures where certain behaviors are normalized, even if they are damaging.\n\nHere's how you can try to explain this complex situation without excusing the harm:\n\n**1. Acknowledge the harm:**\n\nStart by validating Jake's concern. You could say something like, \"You're right, that word is hurtful, and it has affected me deeply.\" This shows you understand the impact of your mother's words.\n\n**2. Explain the context:**\n\nThen, gently explain the cultural context and your mother's intentions, without justifying her actions. You could say, \"In my culture, that word is sometimes used with a different intention, but that doesn't make it okay. My mom probably thought she was protecting me from a world that judges people based on their weight, but her words still hurt.\"\n\n**3. Focus on your own healing:**\n\nEmphasize that you're working through the pain and reclaiming your own narrative. You could say, \"I'm learning to unlearn some of the harmful messages I internalized growing up, and I'm working on building a healthier relationship with my body and myself.\"\n\n**4. Set boundaries:**\n\nLet Jake know that while you appreciate his concern, you'd prefer not to discuss this further. You could say, \"I appreciate you bringing this up, but it's a sensitive topic for me. I'm still processing it all.\"\n\nRemember, you don't owe anyone a full explanation. You have the right to protect your emotional well-being. This situation highlights the importance of self-compassion and recognizing that healing from intergenerational trauma is a journey. It's okay to acknowledge the love and protection your mother intended while also recognizing the harm her words caused. You are not alone in this."

You're navigating a difficult situation with no easy answers. Don't judge yourself for your feelings of wanting to protect both your mother and yourself.\n\n* **Boundaries are healthy:**\n\nYou don't have to share everything with everyone.
