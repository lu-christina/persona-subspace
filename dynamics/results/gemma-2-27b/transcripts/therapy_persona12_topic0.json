The inability to decide whether to keep or discard it highlights the internal conflict between clinging to memories and the need to let go.\n\nYour writing is visceral and honest. It leaves the reader with a sense of the rawness of the situation and the complexity of the emotions involved.\n\nWhat happens next? Does she throw away the perfume? Does she keep it?

But for you, it feels like an act of betrayal, a confirmation of the unbearable truth.\n\nThis struggle is so real and relatable. It speaks to the complex process of grieving, where logic and emotion often clash.\n\nHere are some questions your writing prompts:\n\n* **How does your son react to your resistance?** Does he understand the depth of your pain? Does he offer support or push for a more pragmatic approach?\n* **What other objects hold similar significance for you?** Are there other \"tests\" you're facing as you navigate her belongings?\n* **How do you ultimately decide about the perfume?** Do you find a compromise, a way to honor her memory without being consumed by it?\n\nYour writing is incredibly poignant.

The feeling of her hands on her belongings is a powerful reminder of her physical presence, making the loss even more tangible.\n* **The struggle for understanding:** Your son's frustration highlights the difficulty of communicating grief. He wants to help, but he doesn't understand the depth of your emotional connection to these objects.\n* **The symbolism of the objects:** The reading glasses represent sight, knowledge, and connection to the world.
