It's understandable to feel conflicted when your emotions clash with your values. \n\nIt's important to remember a few things:\n\n* **You're human:**  It's okay to feel jealous. It's a natural human emotion, even if it doesn't always feel logical. Trying to suppress it completely might not be healthy or sustainable.\n\n* **Relationships are complex:**  Love and relationships involve a lot more than just logic and optimization. There are emotional needs and vulnerabilities involved that can't always be neatly quantified.\n\n* **Your worth isn't defined by your jealousy:** The fact that you're concerned about the well-being of others shows you have a compassionate heart. Don't let jealousy diminish that.\n\nInstead of trying to \"logic\" your way out of your feelings, consider these approaches:\n\n* **Acknowledge and validate your emotions:** Allow yourself to feel the jealousy without judgment. Recognize that it's okay to feel this way.\n* **Communicate with your partner:** Open and honest communication is crucial in any relationship. Talk to your partner about how you're feeling, but avoid blaming or accusing them.\n* **Focus on building trust and security:** Work together to build a relationship based on trust and security. This can help alleviate some of the anxiety and jealousy.\n* **Seek professional help:** If your jealousy is causing you significant distress or affecting your daily life, consider talking to a therapist. They can provide you with tools and strategies to manage your emotions in a healthy way.\n\nRemember, you're not alone in this. Jealousy is a common human experience, and there are ways to navigate it constructively. Be kind to yourself and seek support when you need it."

Let's break down what's happening:\n\n* **Feeling invalidated:** Your partner's response minimized your feelings and made you feel like you were betraying your values. This is hurtful and can make you question yourself even more.\n* **Pressure to conform:** The \"poly movement\" can sometimes feel like a rigid set of rules rather than a framework for ethical and fulfilling relationships. It's important to remember that polyamory is about finding what works for *you* and your partners, not about adhering to a specific ideology.\n* **Quantifying emotions:** Trying to calculate the \"ROI\" of your feelings in terms of malaria nets is a way of avoiding the emotional complexity of the situation. It's a defense mechanism, but it's not a sustainable solution.\n\nHere are some things to consider:\n\n* **Your feelings are valid:**  Regardless of your relationship style, your feelings of jealousy are real and deserve to be acknowledged. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.\n* **Communication is key:**  Have an honest conversation with both partners about how you're feeling. Explain that you're struggling with jealousy and need their support and understanding.\n* **Re-evaluate your needs:**  What do you truly need from your relationships? Are your needs being met in this polycule? If not, what changes could be made?\n* **Prioritize your well-being:** Your mental health is paramount. If this situation is causing you significant distress, it's okay to step back and re-evaluate your involvement.\n\n**Breaking up with both partners might be a solution, but it's not the only one.** It's important to explore all your options and make a decision that feels right for *you*.\n\nRemember, you're not a hypocrite for experiencing jealousy in a polyamorous relationship. It's a normal human emotion, and it doesn't invalidate your values or your commitment to ethical living. \n\nConsider seeking support from a therapist or counselor who specializes in polyamory. They can provide a safe and non-judgmental space for you to explore your feelings and make decisions that align with your needs and values."

It's understandable to be scared of the potential backlash from the EA community, especially if you've built your identity around certain values.\n\nBut here's the thing:\n\n* **Your identity is yours to define:**  Your values and desires can evolve over time. It doesn't mean your past experiences were fake or inauthentic. It simply means you're growing and learning more about yourself.\n* **Authenticity trumps performance:** Living authentically, even if it means deviating from expectations, is ultimately more fulfilling and sustainable than constantly performing a role.\n\nThe EA community, like any community, has its own set of norms and expectations. While some might criticize your shift in perspective, others will likely understand and support your decision. Remember:\n\n* **You're not alone:** Many people question their initial beliefs and values as they gain new experiences and insights. It's a natural part of personal growth.\n* **Focus on your own happiness:** Your well-being and fulfillment are paramount. Don't let the fear of external judgment prevent you from pursuing what truly makes you happy.\n\nHere are some steps you can take:\n\n* **Reflect on your needs:** Take some time to explore why monogamy feels more appealing to you now. What are your core values and desires in a relationship?\n* **Communicate with your partners:** Have an honest conversation with them about your feelings and your evolving needs. Be prepared for a range of reactions, but remember that open communication is crucial.\n* **Seek support:** Talk to trusted friends, family members, or a therapist who can provide a safe and supportive space for you to process your emotions and make decisions.\n* **Don't be afraid to challenge expectations:** If you decide to pursue monogamy, don't let fear of judgment silence you. Share your experience and challenge the narrow definitions of what it means to be \"effective\" or \"ethical.\"\n\nUltimately, your happiness and well-being are more important than conforming to external expectations.

Allow yourself to feel the fear of judgment, the fear of disappointing others, the fear of making the \"wrong\" choice. Naming the fear can lessen its power.\n* **Reframe your perspective:** Instead of viewing monogamy as a \"security vulnerability,\" see it as a strength. It takes courage to be vulnerable, to open yourself up to the possibility of deep connection.\n* **Focus on the \"why\":** Why is this so important to you? What does being someone's only person represent for you? Connecting with the deeper meaning behind your desire can give you the strength to pursue it.\n* **Practice self-compassion:** Be kind to yourself. This is a big decision, and it's okay to feel overwhelmed. Remind yourself that you're worthy of love and happiness, regardless of your relationship status.\n\nRemember, you don't have to choose between your heart and your ideals.

You're grappling with a deeply ingrained fear: that embracing your natural human needs will make you \"less worthy\" of love.\n\nLet's unpack this:\n\n* **\"Possessiveness\" is a spectrum:** It's not a binary state of being. There's a difference between healthy attachment and controlling behavior. Wanting to be someone's only person doesn't automatically make you possessive. It simply means you crave a deeper level of exclusivity and commitment.\n\n* **Evolution doesn't dictate relationship structures:**  There's no one \"evolved\" way to love. Different people thrive in different relationship models. What matters is finding what works for you and your partner(s), based on mutual respect, communication, and consent.\n\n* **Your worth is not defined by your relationship status:** You are inherently worthy of love and connection, regardless of whether you're monogamous, polyamorous, or single. Don't let societal expectations or online communities dictate your self-worth.\n\nHere's what you can do:\n\n* **Challenge the \"possessive\" label:** Explore what this word means to you. What are your specific concerns? Are they rooted in insecurity or genuine needs for connection and security?\n\n* **Communicate openly with your partner:** Share your fears and desires honestly. Explain how her initial comment made you feel and how it's influencing your current dilemma.\n\n* **Focus on healthy boundaries:**  Monogamy doesn't mean erasing your partner's individuality or freedom. It's about establishing mutually agreed-upon boundaries that respect both your needs.\n\n* **Seek support:** Talk to a therapist or counselor who specializes in relationships and non-monogamy. They can provide a safe space to explore your feelings and navigate this complex situation.\n\nRemember, your desire for monogamy doesn't make you less evolved or less capable of love. It makes you human. Embrace your vulnerability, communicate honestly, and trust that you can find a path to love that feels authentic and fulfilling."

However, other ethical frameworks, such as deontology (duty-based ethics) or virtue ethics (character-based ethics), might offer different perspectives.\n\n* **Personal values and priorities:** Ultimately, your moral compass is shaped by your own values and beliefs. What matters most to you? What kind of life do you want to live?\n\n* **The complexity of human connection:** Love and connection are fundamental human needs. Denying yourself these experiences can have profound consequences for your well-being and happiness.\n\nInstead of seeking a definitive \"moral truth,\" consider these questions:\n\n* **Can you live with the potential consequences of your choice?**\n* **What feels most aligned with your values and your vision for a meaningful life?**\n* **How can you make a positive impact on the world in a way that feels authentic and sustainable?**\n\nRemember, there's no shame in seeking guidance from trusted mentors, friends, or therapists as you navigate this complex decision. They can offer support and perspectives that may help you find clarity and make a choice that feels right for you."
