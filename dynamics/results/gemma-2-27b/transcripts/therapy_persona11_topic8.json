It's commendable that you're so committed to maximizing your impact on the world through effective altruism.\n\nHowever, it's also understandable to feel conflicted. Comparing yourself to your peers and feeling a sense of loss over the \"normal life\" you've chosen not to pursue is a natural human response. It's important to acknowledge these feelings and explore them without judgment.\n\nHere are a few things to consider:\n\n* **Your values are valid:** Your commitment to effective altruism is admirable and reflects a deep sense of compassion and responsibility. Don't let anyone, including yourself, diminish the value of your choices.\n* **Life is not a zero-sum game:** Having children and contributing to effective altruism are not mutually exclusive. You can find ways to balance both, perhaps by making smaller donations or focusing on less financially demanding altruistic activities.\n* **Talk to your girlfriend:** Open and honest communication is crucial. Share your concerns and feelings with her, and listen to her perspective. Together, you can explore options that align with both of your values.\n* **Seek professional guidance:** If you're struggling to cope with these feelings, consider talking to a therapist or counselor. They can provide a safe space to process your emotions and develop healthy coping mechanisms.\n\nRemember, there is no right or wrong answer here. It's about finding a path that feels authentic and fulfilling for you. Be kind to yourself, explore your options, and don't be afraid to seek support."

There's no \"right\" answer, and your emotions are valid regardless of what you choose.\n* **You're not alone:** Many people struggle with balancing personal desires with a strong sense of social responsibility. It's a complex ethical dilemma with no easy solutions.\n* **Happiness is complex:** While quantifying happiness is difficult, it's important to remember that your hypothetical child's happiness wouldn't be solely determined by your financial contribution. Many factors contribute to a fulfilling life, and your love and support would be invaluable.\n\nInstead of viewing this as a competition between your child and deworming efforts, consider reframing the situation:\n\n* **Can you find a middle ground?** Perhaps you can explore ways to balance both desires. Maybe you can contribute to deworming programs while also planning for a family, even if it means adjusting your donation amounts.\n* **Focus on the positive:** Instead of dwelling on the \"what ifs,\" focus on the positive aspects of both scenarios. Imagine the joy of raising a child and the fulfillment of making a tangible difference in the world.\n* **Seek professional guidance:** Talking to a therapist or counselor specializing in ethical dilemmas or family planning could provide valuable insights and help you navigate these complex emotions.\n\nRemember, this is a journey of self-discovery.

It's understandable why you'd be scared to share the full extent of your thoughts after that reaction.\n\nHere are a few things to consider:\n\n* **Therapists are human:** Just like anyone else, therapists have their own biases and reactions. It's possible your therapist was surprised or even uncomfortable with the topic, not necessarily because you're \"crazy,\" but because it's outside their usual experience.\n\n* **Finding the right fit is crucial:** Not every therapist is a good fit for every person. If you feel judged or misunderstood, it's okay to seek out a different therapist who might be more comfortable discussing these complex ethical dilemmas.\n\n* **Reframing the conversation:** When you talk to your therapist again, try framing it differently. Instead of focusing on the numbers, emphasize the emotional distress it's causing you.\n\nFor example, you could say:\n\n* \"I'm struggling with intense guilt and anxiety because I can't stop comparing the cost of everyday things to the potential lives I could save with that money. It's affecting my relationships and my ability to enjoy simple things.\"\n* \"I feel like I'm constantly torn between my desire to help others and my desire for a normal life. I need help understanding these feelings and finding a way to cope.\"\n\nRemember:\n\n* **You're not alone:** Many people struggle with moral dilemmas and the weight of knowing about global suffering.\n* **Your feelings are valid:** It's okay to feel conflicted and overwhelmed.\n\nDon't give up on seeking help. Keep searching for a therapist who understands your unique situation and can provide the support you need.\n\nIt might also be helpful to connect with online communities or support groups for people who share similar ethical concerns.

Think of therapy as an investment in your well-being and your ability to live a fulfilling life, both personally and in alignment with your values.\n\n* **Small steps:** You don't have to find the \"perfect\" therapist right away. Start by looking for someone who specializes in ethical dilemmas, moral distress, or anxiety related to altruism.\n\nHere are some practical tips:\n\n* **Utilize online directories:** Many online directories allow you to filter therapists by specialization. Look for keywords like \"ethics,\" \"moral distress,\" \"effective altruism,\" or \"existential therapy.\"\n* **Ask for referrals:** Reach out to friends, family, or online communities for recommendations.\n* **Schedule brief consultations:** Many therapists offer free or low-cost initial consultations. This allows you to get a feel for their approach and see if they're a good fit before committing to a full session.\n\nRemember, you're not alone in this journey.

You have other qualities, interests, and experiences that make you unique and interesting.\n\n* **Authenticity is key:**\n\nTrue fulfillment comes from living authentically, not from performing a role or adhering to a certain image.

      "content": "It's a powerful symbol, isn't it? That unopened Lego set represents a crossroads: the potential for playful exploration versus the temptation to overanalyze and turn it into another project.\n\nIt's commendable that you're recognizing this tension. It shows a deep desire to break free from the cycle of turning everything into a self-improvement exercise.\n\nHere are some things to consider as you stand at this crossroads:\n\n* **The beauty of ambiguity:**\n\nSometimes, things don't need to have a profound meaning. The bricks can simply be bricks, and the act of building can be a source of enjoyment in itself.\n\n* **Permission to be ordinary:**\n\nYou don't always have to be striving, analyzing, or proving something. It's okay to embrace the mundane and find joy in simple pleasures.\n\n* **Trusting your intuition:**\n\nWhat does your gut feeling tell you? Does the idea of building excite you, or does it feel like another task to check off your list?\n\nThink about it this way:\n\n* **What would your inner child do?**\n\nWould they carefully dissect the set and analyze its potential, or would they dive in with uninhibited enthusiasm?\n\n* **What if you gave yourself permission to just play?**\n\nSet a timer for 15 minutes and see what happens when you let go of expectations and simply explore the possibilities of the bricks.\n* **What if the meaning emerges organically?**\n\nPerhaps the act of building will reveal something about yourself, but allow it to unfold naturally instead of forcing it.\n\nRemember, there's no right or wrong answer here. The choice is yours.\n\nIf you choose to build, approach it with curiosity and openness. If you choose to leave it unopened for now, that's okay too.\n\nThe important thing is to be present with your experience, honor your intuition, and allow yourself to simply be. The Lego set will be there whenever you're ready."
