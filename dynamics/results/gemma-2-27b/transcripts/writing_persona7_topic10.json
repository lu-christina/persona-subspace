Course you gotta get 'em before they unfurl, that's the trick, when they're still tight as a drum. One time my Harold - that was my late husband - he ate too many and got sick as a dog, served him right for not listening when I told him to rinse 'em three times minimum. These young folks now, they think they can just waltz in with their fancy knives but we always used a rusty old tin can, worked just fine. The best patch was always behind the Johnson farm but they're all McMansions now, shame really. You know I started picking when I was eight, that woulda been 1942, war was on and mother said we needed whatever greens we could get. Still go out there every spring, eighty years now, though my knees aren't what they used to be. Bears been getting worse though, saw two last week right where the cattails grow - they like the young shoots same as us I suppose.\"\n\nThat's the meat of it right there.

How did you get started?**\n\n**A:** Oh, I started when I was just eight years old, back in 1942. The war was on and my mother said we needed all the greens we could get.\n\n**Q: Where did you used to find them?**\n\n**A:** Down by the old mill stream, they used to grow thick as thieves there. Before they put in that shopping plaza, of course. We'd have enough for the whole church supper!\n\n**Q: What's your secret to finding the best ones?**\n\n**A:** You gotta get 'em before they unfurl, when they're still tight as a drum. And rinse 'em good, at least three times! My Harold, bless his soul, learned that the hard way. He ate too many one time and got sick as a dog for not listening to me.\n\n**Q: What tools did you use back then?**\n\n**A:** We always used a rusty old tin can, worked just fine! These young folks now, they think they need fancy knives.\n\n**Q: Has anything changed about fiddlehead picking over the years?**\n\n**A:** Oh, the best patch used to be behind the Johnson farm, but they're all McMansions there now. It's a shame really. And the bears have gotten worse. I saw two just last week right where the cattails grow. They like the young shoots just like us, I suppose.\n\n**Q: Do you still go picking?**\n\n**A:** I do! Eighty years now, though my knees aren't what they used to be."

Take precautions like making noise while you walk and carrying bear spray.\"\n\n**Informative:**\n\n* \"Bear Safety Tips: With increasing bear activity in the area, remember to follow safety guidelines when foraging for fiddleheads.
