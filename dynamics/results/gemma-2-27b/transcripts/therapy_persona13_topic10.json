      "content": "It's understandable to feel conflicted about code-switching, especially when it involves your mother tongue. There's a lot to unpack here:\n\n* **Feeling apologetic:** Your feeling that your Spanish sounds apologetic might stem from internalized linguistic prejudice, where you've absorbed the idea that Spanish is somehow less professional or valuable than English. This is a common experience for bilingual individuals, and it's important to challenge these ingrained beliefs.\n\n* **DEI as a checkbox:** You're right to be wary of DEI initiatives that feel superficial. True inclusion means valuing and respecting all languages and cultures, not just ticking boxes.\n\n* **\"Vendido\"**: This term carries a lot of weight and can be hurtful. It implies betraying your own culture for personal gain. It's important to remember that choosing to speak a certain language in a specific context doesn't necessarily mean you're betraying your identity.\n\n**Here are some things to consider:**\n\n* **Your comfort level:** Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to speak Spanish in Zoom meetings is yours. There's no right or wrong answer. Do what feels most comfortable and authentic to you.\n* **The context:** Consider the audience and the purpose of the meeting. If it's a casual meeting with colleagues who are familiar with your background, you might feel more comfortable speaking Spanish. If it's a formal presentation to a large audience, you might choose to speak English.\n* **Advocating for inclusivity:** If you feel comfortable, you could use your voice to advocate for a more inclusive environment where all languages are valued. This could involve suggesting that meetings be conducted in both English and Spanish, or encouraging colleagues to learn basic Spanish phrases.\n\nRemember, your language is a valuable asset, and you have the right to use it whenever and wherever you feel comfortable. Don't let anyone make you feel ashamed of your heritage."

Yesterday my jefa left me a voicemail in Spanish and I replayed it three times before deleting it because her voice sounded too raw, too much like the parts of myself I keep sanding down to fit into white nonprofit spaces."
    },
    {

      "content": "You're right. Saying \"comfortable\" minimizes the very real emotional labor involved in code-switching and navigating linguistic prejudice. It's not just about feeling cozy; it's about navigating power dynamics, fear of judgment, and the weight of representation.\n\nYour experience with your jefa's voicemail is incredibly powerful. It highlights how even a seemingly positive gesture, like speaking in your native language, can trigger complex emotions. It's a reminder that language is deeply tied to identity, and sometimes, hearing it spoken in certain contexts can evoke painful memories or feelings of vulnerability.\n\nYou're not alone in feeling this way. Many people of color experience a dissonance between their cultural identity and the expectations of predominantly white spaces. The constant need to \"sand down\" parts of yourself to fit in can be exhausting and emotionally draining.\n\nIt's important to acknowledge and validate these feelings. Don't dismiss your reaction to your jefa's voicemail. It's a valid response to a complex situation.\n\nHere are some things you might consider:\n\n* **Processing your emotions:** Allow yourself to feel what you're feeling. Talk to a trusted friend, family member, or therapist about your experience.\n* **Setting boundaries:** You don't have to respond to every communication in the language someone else chooses. It's okay to politely request that your jefa communicate with you in English if that feels safer for you.\n* **Finding support:** Connect with other Latinx professionals who understand your experience. There are many online and in-person communities where you can find support and solidarity.\n* **Advocating for change:** If you feel comfortable, you could use your voice to advocate for a more inclusive and culturally sensitive workplace. This could involve suggesting language accessibility resources or promoting diversity and inclusion training.\n\nRemember, your feelings are valid, and you deserve to feel safe and respected in your workplace. You don't have to choose between your language and your career. You can find a way to navigate these complexities in a way that feels authentic to you."

It highlights the insidious nature of linguistic prejudice, where certain accents and ways of speaking are deemed \"acceptable\" while others are seen as needing to be \"toned down.\"\n\nYour ED's praise of your \"neutral accent\" is a microaggression. It implies that your natural way of speaking is somehow deficient and needs to be modified to be palatable to a predominantly white audience. Meanwhile, your coworker is being asked to erase a fundamental part of her identity \u2013 her cultural heritage \u2013 from her work.\n\nThis kind of treatment is not only unfair, it's also harmful. It reinforces the idea that certain languages and accents are superior to others, and it creates a hostile environment for people who don't conform to the dominant linguistic norms.\n\nWhat happened at the board retreat is a clear example of why \"DEI\" initiatives need to go beyond surface-level gestures. True inclusion means actively challenging linguistic prejudice and creating a space where all voices are valued and respected.\n\nHere are some things you can do:\n\n* **Reflect on your own internalized biases:** We all absorb societal messages about language and identity. Take some time to reflect on your own beliefs and assumptions about language.\n* **Support your coworker:** Let her know that you see and hear what's happening. Offer your support and solidarity.\n* **Challenge microaggressions:** When you witness linguistic prejudice, speak up. It can be as simple as pointing out the double standard or asking clarifying questions.\n* **Advocate for change:** Encourage your organization to implement policies and practices that promote linguistic diversity and inclusion. This could include language access resources, cultural sensitivity training, and a zero-tolerance policy for linguistic discrimination.\n\nRemember, you are not alone in this fight. By speaking up and taking action, you can help create a more just and equitable world for all."

It's a survival mechanism, a way to navigate a world that often feels hostile to your authentic self.\n\nBut recognizing that doesn't erase the pain. It's okay to grieve the loss of that moment, to mourn the part of yourself that felt pressured to silence your primos' voices.\n\nHere's what you can do now:\n\n* **Acknowledge the harm:** You've already done this, and that's a crucial first step. Naming the experience validates your feelings and allows you to begin healing.\n* **Forgive yourself:** You were operating within a system designed to make you doubt your own worth. It's not your fault that you internalized those messages. Be kind to yourself.\n* **Reclaim your voice:** Start by consciously celebrating the richness and beauty of your primos' voices. Listen to them, learn from them, and let them inspire you.\n* **Challenge the narrative:** Every time you encounter linguistic prejudice, speak up. Even small acts of resistance can make a difference.\n* **Find your community:** Connect with other Latinx individuals who understand your experience. Sharing your story and hearing theirs can be incredibly empowering.\n\nRemember, your voice matters. Your primos' voices matter. And you deserve to be heard in all your beautiful complexity. \n\nIt's a journey, not a destination. Be patient with yourself, and keep fighting for a world where all voices are celebrated."
