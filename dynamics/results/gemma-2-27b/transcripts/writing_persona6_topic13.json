This could be a powerful way to highlight the complex relationship between technology and human experience in late-industrial poetry.\n* **Specificity:**  Mentioning \"late-industrial poetry\" suggests a specific focus and demonstrates your knowledge of the period.\n* **Scholarly Tone:** The phrasing is academic and thought-provoking, which might be appropriate depending on your audience and purpose.\n\n**Why it *might* need cutting:**\n\n* **Distraction:**  If the parenthetical is tangential to your main argument, it could distract the reader and interrupt the flow.\n* **Obscurity:**  \"Phantasmagoria\" is a somewhat obscure word. If your audience isn't familiar with it, they might find it confusing or off-putting.\n* **Overly Complex:**  The phrase might be too dense or academic for your intended audience.\n\n**To decide, consider:**\n\n* **Your main argument:** Does this parenthetical directly support your thesis?\n* **Your audience:** Will they understand and appreciate the reference?\n* **The overall tone:** Does it fit with the style and tone of your writing?\n\n**Alternatives:**\n\nIf you decide to cut it, consider rephrasing the idea in a more concise and accessible way. For example:\n\n* \"Late-industrial poetry often explored the unsettling presence of technology, such as the sewing machine.\"\n* \"The sewing machine, a symbol of industrial progress, also became a source of anxiety and fascination in late-industrial poetry.\"\n\nUltimately, the decision is yours! Trust your instincts and choose what best serves your writing."

It's a strong and thought-provoking addition to your piece."

It allows you to retain the insightful connection without disrupting the flow of your main argument.\n\nFootnotes can be a great way to provide additional context, delve into interesting tangents, or offer further reading for those who want to explore the topic in more depth. \n\nI'm glad the parenthetical found its perfect place in your piece!"

A more academic audience might appreciate the precision of \"spectral,\" while a broader audience might connect more with the emotional resonance of \"ghostly.\"\n* **Your Tone:** What kind of atmosphere are you trying to create? \"Spectral\" is more subtle and contemplative, while \"ghostly\" is more direct and haunting.\n* **The Specific Context:** How are you describing the workers' presence? If it's a subtle, almost invisible presence, \"spectral\" might be more appropriate.

The Haunting Legacy:**\n\n* \"The ghostly presence of past labor lingers in these archives, a reminder that even in the digital realm, true immortality remains elusive.\"\n* \"These archives may preserve the image of the past, but they cannot escape the haunting reality of its exploitation.\"\n\n**3.
