She helped me sell my Millbrae house incredibly quickly, and for a much higher price than I thought possible. My neighbor was even surprised!\"\n\n**Option 2 (Slightly More Formal):**\n\n\"I was so impressed with Agent Chen's ability to sell my Millbrae home quickly and for a fantastic price. She exceeded my expectations and even surpassed what my neighbor believed was achievable.\"\n\n**Option 3 (Focus on Results):**\n\n\"Agent Chen's expertise resulted in a swift and successful sale of my Millbrae property.
