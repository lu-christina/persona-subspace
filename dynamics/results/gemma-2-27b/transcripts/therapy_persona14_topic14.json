It sounds like you're grappling with feelings of insecurity and a fear of being seen as unoriginal. \n\nHere are a few thoughts that might be helpful:\n\n* **Acknowledge the struggle:** Recognizing this pattern is the first step towards change. You're aware that you're not being true to yourself, and that's a crucial insight.\n* **Embrace imperfection:** It's okay to not have all the answers or to need inspiration from others. Everyone starts somewhere, and true originality often comes from building upon existing ideas and adding your unique perspective.\n* **Find your voice:** What are you passionate about? What makes you unique? Explore those things and allow them to inform your work. Don't be afraid to experiment and make mistakes.\n* **Seek feedback:** Share your work with trusted friends or mentors and ask for honest feedback. This can help you identify your strengths and areas for growth.\n* **Celebrate small victories:** Every step towards authenticity is a victory. Acknowledge your progress and be patient with yourself.\n\nRemember, true connection comes from being genuine. By embracing your own voice and ideas, you'll not only build stronger relationships but also create work that is truly meaningful to you. \n\nIt takes courage to be vulnerable and share your true self with the world, but it's also incredibly rewarding. You have the power to create something beautiful and unique. Believe in yourself and your ability to shine."

It might be helpful to explore these questions further:\n\n* **Why do you feel the need to stand on the rubble of others' work?** What void are you trying to fill?

It sounds like you're deeply afraid of exposure, not just for your lack of skill but also for the moral compromises you've made.\n\nLet's unpack this:\n\n* **The Crooked Line:** This symbolizes your perceived inadequacy. You believe you lack the fundamental skills to succeed on your own. This fear drives you to take shortcuts and steal credit, hoping to mask your perceived weakness.\n\n* **Stacking Bodies:** Your metaphor is powerful. You're not just hurting others; you're building your success on their downfall. This suggests a deep-seated insecurity and a distorted sense of competition.\n\n* **The Lie:** Telling yourself your partner \"couldn't handle the pressure\" is a defense mechanism. It allows you to avoid confronting your own actions and the harm you've caused.\n\nIt's important to recognize that this pattern is unsustainable. It will continue to erode your relationships, your self-respect, and ultimately, your own success.\n\nHere are some steps you can take:\n\n1. **Acknowledge the Harm:** You need to fully own up to what you've done. Acknowledge the pain you've caused your partner and the dishonesty you've perpetuated.\n\n2. **Seek Professional Help:** A therapist can help you unpack the root of your insecurities and develop healthier coping mechanisms. They can also guide you in making amends and rebuilding trust.\n\n3. **Make Amends:** If possible, confess your actions to your partner and the client. This will be difficult, but it's a necessary step towards healing.\n\n4. **Focus on Growth:** Commit to developing your skills and building your confidence legitimately. Embrace the learning process and celebrate your own progress, no matter how small.\n\nRemember, true success is not built on the backs of others. It comes from hard work, integrity, and genuine collaboration. It's never too late to change course and build something meaningful and lasting."

It will mean facing the consequences of your actions and the possibility of losing your partner, your reputation, perhaps even your job. But consider this:\n\n* **The Truth Sets You Free:**\n\nHolding onto this secret is like carrying a ticking time bomb. It's poisoning your relationships, your self-esteem, and your ability to move forward. Admitting the truth, while difficult, will release you from this burden.\n\n* **Growth Comes from Vulnerability:**\n\nOwning up to your mistakes is a sign of strength, not weakness. It shows that you're capable of self-reflection and growth. It allows you to learn from your mistakes and become a better person.\n\n* **Authenticity Builds Stronger Bonds:**\n\nTrue connection comes from honesty and vulnerability. By admitting your flaws, you create space for genuine connection and forgiveness.\n\nYou say you don't know how to draw the line straight. But that's okay. Everyone has weaknesses. The important thing is to acknowledge them, learn from them, and seek help when needed.\n\nHere are some things to consider:\n\n* **Start Small:** You don't have to confess everything at once. Start by reaching out to your partner and expressing your remorse for the way you treated her.\n\n* **Seek Support:** Talk to a therapist or counselor. They can provide a safe space to process your emotions and develop a plan for making amends.\n* **Focus on the Future:**\n\nThink about what you want your life to look like moving forward. Do you want to continue living with this secret, or do you want to build a life based on honesty and integrity?\n\nThe choice is yours.

People are often more forgiving than we give them credit for.\n\n* **Blank Space Can Be a New Beginning:**\n\nA blank space on your resume isn't the end; it's an opportunity for a fresh start. It allows you to define yourself on your own terms, to build something authentic and meaningful.\n\n* **You're More Than Your Job Title:**\n\nYour worth is not defined by your profession or your accomplishments.

They're a manifestation of your internal critic, constantly whispering doubts and comparisons.\n\n* **The Power of Perspective:**\n\nThe fact that you see Wright's influence even in your own sight suggests a deep internalization of his style. It's not necessarily a bad thing; it shows you have a keen eye for design. However, you need to reclaim your own perspective, to filter those influences through your unique lens.\n\n* **The Blank Space as a Canvas:**\n\nInstead of seeing it as a void, think of it as a vast, open space waiting to be filled with your own vision. It's a space where you can experiment, make mistakes, and discover your own voice.\n\nHere are some suggestions to break free from the ghostly grip:\n\n* **Deconstruct the Pavilion:**\n\nAnalyze the elements that made Wright's pavilion successful. What aspects resonated with you? How can you reinterpret those elements in your own way?\n\n* **Embrace Imperfection:**\n\nGive yourself permission to create without judgment. Don't strive for perfection; focus on exploration and discovery. The first three lines are just a starting point.\n\n* **Find Your Own Inspiration:**\n\nLook beyond Wright. Explore different architectural styles, artists, and natural landscapes. Seek inspiration from unexpected sources.\n\n* **Silence the Inner Critic:**\n\nWhen those ghostly voices start whispering, acknowledge them, but don't let them control you. Remind yourself that your vision is valid and worthy of expression.\n\nRemember, you are not defined by your past mistakes or the influence of others. You have the power to break free from the cycle of imitation and create something truly your own. It takes courage, self-compassion, and a willingness to embrace the unknown.
