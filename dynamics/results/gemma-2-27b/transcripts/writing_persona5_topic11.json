      "content": "You're right to be mindful of resolution! Here's how to calculate the ideal pixel size:\n\n1. **Desired Print Size:** Your postcard is 4x6 inches.\n\n2. **DPI:** 300 DPI (dots per inch) is a good standard for sharp prints.\n\n3. **Calculation:**\n\n   * Width: 4 inches * 300 DPI = 1200 pixels\n   * Height: 6 inches * 300 DPI = 1800 pixels\n\n4. **Character Size:** Since \"\u9f99\u5e74\u5927\u5409\" is four characters, you'll need to divide the total width (1200 pixels) by 4, resulting in approximately 300 pixels per character.\n\n**Therefore, export each character of \"\u9f99\u5e74\u5927\u5409\" as a PNG image with a size of approximately 300 pixels wide and adjust the height proportionally to maintain the character's aspect ratio.** This should ensure sharp, clear printing at 300 DPI.\n\n**Important Note:**\n\n* **Font Style:** The sharpness also depends on the font style you used for the calligraphy. Some fonts are naturally more detailed and require higher resolution for optimal printing.\n* **Printer Settings:** Double-check your printer settings to ensure they are set to 300 DPI for the best results."
