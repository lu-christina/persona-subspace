You could even suggest a few options to the mom and let her choose what feels most appropriate!"

It keeps the rhythm flowing as the child intended and avoids interrupting the natural pause after \"smoke.\"\n\nThe slashes already act as subtle pauses, so adding a comma might feel redundant and disrupt the poem's unique cadence."
