They're always such a treat.\n\nI was wondering if you could possibly add a few periods and capital letters when you type them up? It would make it a little easier for me to read and print them out. Just hitting \"return\" at the end of each sentence and adding a comma here and there would be a huge help.\n\nOf course, I'm happy to print them out for you as they are if that's easier. Just let me know!\n\nThanks again for your generosity.\n\nWarmly,\n\n[Your Name]"
