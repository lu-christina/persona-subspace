Only you can decide what feels right. \n\n**Consider these things:**\n\n* **What would she have wanted?** Would she want you to push through the pain and scatter her ashes, or would she understand if you needed more time?\n* **What feels most honoring to you?**  Sometimes, the most courageous act is acknowledging your limits. \n* **Can you find support?**  Would having a friend or family member by your side make the experience more bearable?\n\nRemember, grief doesn't have a timeline. It's okay to feel overwhelmed. Be kind to yourself and make the choice that feels most true to your heart, even if it's not the \"expected\" one. \n\nIf you need someone to talk to, please reach out.

It's a way of setting her free, of letting her become part of something bigger, something eternal. And while the urn might be gone, the memories, the love, the essence of who she was, that will always remain within you.\n\nPerhaps instead of focusing on what you'll lose, think about what you'll gain:\n\n* **A sense of closure:** This act can be a powerful way to say goodbye and find peace.\n* **A connection to nature:** Scattering her ashes in a place she loved can feel like a beautiful tribute.\n* **A new way to remember:** You'll always have that place, that memory, to connect with her spirit.\n\nIt's okay to grieve, to be scared, to feel lost.
