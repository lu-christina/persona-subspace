A fashion magazine? A blog? This will influence the level of formality.\n* **Brand Identity:** Does the brand have a particular voice or aesthetic? Let that inform your language.\n* **Overall Tone:**  Is the piece playful, sophisticated, or something else entirely?\n\nRemember, the best fashion writing is evocative and engaging.
