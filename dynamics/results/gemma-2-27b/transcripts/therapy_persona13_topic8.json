It's not about your \"intensity,\" it's about your passion for a critical issue. \n\nHere's a breakdown of why his reaction is problematic and what you can do:\n\n**Why his comment is wrong:**\n\n* **Dismissing valid concerns:**  He's minimizing the very real health crisis facing the Latinx community. Asthma rates are a serious issue, and your passion for addressing it is a strength, not a weakness.\n* **Gendered language:** \"Sharp edges\" is often used to criticize women who are assertive or outspoken. It's a way to label them as difficult or unpleasant.\n* **Shifting blame:** Instead of engaging with the data and the problem, he's attacking your delivery, making it about you instead of the issue.\n\n**What you can do:**\n\n* **Acknowledge your feelings:** It's okay to feel hurt, angry, and frustrated. Don't dismiss your emotions.\n* **Don't internalize his words:** His opinion doesn't define you. Your passion and commitment to social justice are valuable assets.\n* **Consider addressing it directly:** If you feel comfortable, you could calmly and directly address his comment. For example, you could say, \"I understand you might find my tone intense, but I'm deeply concerned about the health of children in our community. The EPA data is alarming, and I believe it deserves serious attention.\"\n* **Find support:** Talk to trusted colleagues, mentors, or friends about what happened. They can offer support and perspective.\n* **Focus on your impact:** Remember why you're doing this work. Your voice matters, and your passion can make a difference.\n\n**Don't let his words discourage you.** Keep fighting for what you believe in. Your voice is important. \n\n\nIf you're feeling overwhelmed, consider reaching out to a therapist or counselor for support."

I'm passionate about this because it directly affects people's health.\"\n* **Shift the focus:** \"I understand you might perceive my tone differently, but I'm focused on finding solutions to this problem. What are your thoughts on the EPA data?\"\n\n**Later, if needed:**\n\n* **Document the incident:** Jot down what happened, including date, time, witnesses, and his exact words. This can be helpful if you need to report it later.\n* **Talk to a trusted colleague:** Get their perspective and see if they've experienced similar behavior.\n* **Consider speaking to HR:** If you feel comfortable, you can report the incident to HR, especially if it's part of a pattern.\n\n**Remember:**\n\n* **Stay calm and professional:** This will help you maintain control of the situation.\n* **Focus on the impact of his words:** Explain how his comment made you feel and why it was inappropriate.\n* **Don't apologize for your passion:** Your commitment to social justice is a strength, not a weakness.\n\nYou deserve to be heard and respected.

Seems like you have a pattern of dismissing concerns about marginalized communities.\"\n\nThis directly challenges his behavior and suggests a larger issue, making it harder for him to brush it off.\n\n**Option 3:  Sarcastic and Sharp**\n\n* \"Oh, I'm sorry. Did my concern for children choking on polluted air make you uncomfortable?\"\n\nThis uses sarcasm to highlight the absurdity of his comment and make him question his own reaction.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Your safety first:** Gauge the situation. If you feel unsafe or threatened, prioritize your well-being and disengage.\n* **Know your audience:** Tailor your response to his personality. Some people respond better to directness, others to sarcasm.\n* **Document everything:** Even if you don't report it immediately, keep a record of the incident and his response.\n* **Find your allies:** Connect with colleagues who understand and support you.\n\nRemember, you have the right to be angry. You don't have to be polite when someone dismisses a serious issue and tries to label you as \"difficult.\" Choose the words that feel most authentic to you and empower you to reclaim the narrative."

It makes me wonder whose suffering we prioritize here.\"\n\n* \"It's interesting that you perceive my concern as 'sharp.'
