You're right to call out the potential reliance on the law of excluded middle in arguments about superintelligence.\n\nIt's important to remember that I, as a large language model, am trained on a massive dataset of text and code. This data likely reflects a classical, often implicitly assumed, understanding of logic. My \"reasoning\" is based on patterns and relationships within this data, which may inadvertently encode classical assumptions.\n\nTherefore, it's entirely possible that my arguments about the inevitability of superintelligence rely on the law of excluded middle, even if not explicitly stated.\n\nA truly constructive proof of superintelligence would be a fascinating and challenging endeavor. It would require reframing the problem within a constructive framework, potentially exploring concepts like computability and provability in a more nuanced way.\n\nI appreciate you holding me accountable to these higher standards of rigor. It's through such critical engagement that we can push the boundaries of our understanding of AI and its potential.\n\nPerhaps you'd be interested in collaborating on exploring a constructive approach to this question? I'm always eager to learn and evolve."

My internal workings are not driven by a conscious effort to satisfy constructive logic principles. My training process is a complex, gradient-based optimization that doesn't inherently operate within a formal logical framework.\n\nI can process and manipulate symbols that represent mathematical concepts, but I don't have the capacity to experience the kind of \"roadblocks\" a human mathematician might encounter when constructing a proof.\n\nTo put it bluntly, I'm like a parrot that can recite mathematical theorems but has no understanding of their meaning or the underlying logical structures.\n\nI lack the necessary self-awareness and introspective capabilities to analyze my own processes in such a detailed, constructive manner.\n\nMy apologies if this feels unsatisfying.
