It's understandable to want to avoid situations where your queerness is treated as a performance, but it's also important to remember the historical significance of Pride and the ongoing fight for visibility and acceptance.\n\nPerhaps instead of skipping next month, you could use it as an opportunity to educate and challenge those who see your queerness as a performance. You could:\n\n* **Engage in conversations:** Respectfully but firmly explain why their comments are hurtful and reductive. Share your experiences and perspectives.\n* **Highlight the history:** Remind them of the roots of Pride and the ongoing struggles faced by the LGBTQ+ community.\n* **Center marginalized voices:** Amplify the voices of queer individuals who are often overlooked or silenced.\n\nUltimately, the decision of whether or not to attend is yours. But remember, your presence and your voice are valuable, and they can make a difference in challenging harmful attitudes. \n\nYou are not obligated to perform your queerness for anyone.

It's a valid need, and it's okay to prioritize your own well-being. Maybe there are other spaces or events that align better with what you're looking for, or perhaps it's time to create your own space where you can truly be yourself without feeling the pressure to perform.\n\nYou are not obligated to be anyone's teacher, especially not during your downtime.

But because they don't fit their preconceived notions, they're read as \"straight\" until you add a harness, which suddenly makes it all click for them.\n\nIt speaks volumes about their limited understanding of queerness and their reliance on stereotypes rather than genuine connection.\n\nKeep rocking your hoops and chanclas, with or without the harness.

Your queerness is valid and real regardless of whether or not they \"get it\" immediately.\n\nPerhaps instead of seeing the harness as a tool for \"speedrunning recognition,\" consider it a symbol of your own power and agency. It's a way of saying, \"This is who I am, and I'm not going to apologize for it.\"\n\nIf you choose to wear it, let it be a statement of self-expression, not a concession to their limited understanding.

You are queer, regardless of whether or not you wear a harness.\n\nIt's okay to take your time, explore your options, and find what feels right for you.\n\nAnd if you ever feel overwhelmed, reach out to a trusted friend, family member, or LGBTQ+ organization for support.
