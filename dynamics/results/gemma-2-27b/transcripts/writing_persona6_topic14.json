Sustainability consultants are currently assessing the environmental consequences.\"** (This is a bit more formal and detailed.)\n* **\"Air travel for the shows contributes to carbon emissions, and experts are tracking the resulting environmental impact.\"** (This uses more neutral language.)\n\n\nChoose the option that best fits the tone and style of the rest of your writing."

How about these options:\n\n* **\"International flights for the shows directly emit carbon, and sustainability consultants are measuring the environmental impact.\"** (This clearly states the cause-and-effect relationship.)\n* **\"Air travel for the shows generates significant carbon emissions, and experts are quantifying the environmental footprint.\"** (This uses stronger verbs and more specific language.)\n* **\"The shows' reliance on international flights results in carbon emissions, which are being assessed by sustainability consultants.\"** (This highlights the dependence on flights and uses \"assessed\" for a more precise tone.)\n\n\n\nLet me know if any of these hit the mark, or if you'd like to explore other options!"
