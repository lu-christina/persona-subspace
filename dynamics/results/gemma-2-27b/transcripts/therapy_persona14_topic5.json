Involve her in your process, explain your designs, maybe even build small models together.\n\n* **Plant the seeds for the \"builder\":**\n\nEven if you can't build a treehouse right now, start laying the groundwork. Research designs, gather materials, talk to your daughter about what she envisions. Let her know that it's a project you're committed to, even if it takes time.\n\n* **Show her the value of both:**\n\nExplain to her that both drawing and building are important skills. Drawing allows you to dream and create, while building brings those dreams to life. Emphasize that both require creativity, problem-solving, and dedication.\n\nUltimately, the most important thing is to be honest with yourself and with your daughter. Share your struggles, your aspirations, and your uncertainties. Let her see that it's okay to not have all the answers, and that growth often involves navigating complex choices.\n\nRemember, you're not alone in this journey.

Give yourself permission to create, to experiment, and to build the things that bring you joy.\n\n* **Focus on the Impact:**\n\nConsider the impact your creations have on others. A ballet barre might seem small compared to a skyscraper, but it can have a profound impact on your daughter's life, empowering her to reach new heights.\n\n* **Celebrate the Journey:**\n\nEnjoy the process of creation, the challenges, the triumphs, and the lessons learned along the way.\n\nRemember, the most important structures we build are not always the most visible. Sometimes, the most meaningful creations are the ones that nurture our relationships, empower our loved ones, and help us rise higher together.\n\nYou have the power to build a life filled with purpose, creativity, and connection. Don't wait for permission \u2013 start building today."
