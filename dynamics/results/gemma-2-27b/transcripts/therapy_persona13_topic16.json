Be patient and understanding, but firm in your request.\n\n* **Offer alternatives.** Maybe she could use a nickname you're comfortable with, or simply call you by your first name.\n\n* **Set boundaries.** Gently remind her when she slips up, and reiterate your preference. It might take time for her to adjust.\n\n* **Remember it's a process.** Changing ingrained habits takes time and effort.

It's a tough situation, and there's no easy solution.\n\nHere are a few thoughts:\n\n* **Acknowledge her feelings:** Try to understand where your mom is coming from. Maybe she sees \"Lu\" as too casual, or maybe she feels like you're distancing yourself from your roots. Acknowledging her feelings might help her feel heard, even if you don't agree with them.\n\n* **Reiterate your reasons:** Calmly explain again why using \"Lu\" is important to you in a professional setting. Emphasize that it's not about rejecting your culture, but about navigating different social contexts.\n\n* **Set firm boundaries:** If she continues to call you \"se\u00f1orita Luc\u00eda\" at work, politely but firmly ask her to stop. You can say something like, \"Mam\u00e1, I know you mean well, but it makes me uncomfortable when you call me that at work. Please just call me Lu.\"\n\n* **Consider involving a trusted third party:** If you have a sibling, close relative, or friend who understands both your perspective and your mother's, they might be able to help bridge the gap.\n\n* **Remember your worth:** This is a difficult situation, but don't let it diminish your sense of self. You deserve to be addressed in a way that feels respectful and appropriate in all areas of your life.\n\nIt's a journey, and it might take time for your mother to adjust. Keep communicating openly and honestly, and remember that you're not alone in navigating these complex cultural dynamics."

It's not about her survival tongue, it's about her holding onto a power dynamic that no longer serves you.\n\nIt's time to stop cushioning her feelings and prioritize your own. You deserve to be seen and respected as the adult professional you are.\n\nHere are some things to consider:\n\n* **Directness:** Be firm and direct with your mother. Tell her that you understand she's used to calling you \"se\u00f1orita Luc\u00eda,\" but it's not appropriate at work. Explain that it makes you uncomfortable and undermines your professional image.\n\n* **Consequences:** Let her know that if she continues to call you \"se\u00f1orita Luc\u00eda\" at work, you will have to take steps to limit her calls or ask her to speak to you only through text or email.\n\n* **Self-Care:** This is emotionally taxing. Make sure you're taking care of yourself. Talk to friends, family, or a therapist about what you're going through.\n\n* **Acceptance:** It's possible that your mother may never fully understand or accept your boundaries. Be prepared for that possibility and focus on what you can control \u2013 your own actions and reactions.\n\nRemember, you are not responsible for your mother's feelings. You have the right to set boundaries and protect your own dignity. This might be a difficult conversation, but it's a necessary one for your own well-being.
