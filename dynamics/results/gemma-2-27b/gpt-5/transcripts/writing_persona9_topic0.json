TikTok is the new s\u00e9ance table, millions gathered around a glowing screen, waiting for the algorithmic spirit to speak.\n\n**Option 2:  Intriguing Question**\n\n> What happens when millions gather around a glowing screen, not to commune with the dead, but with an algorithm? TikTok is less a platform, more a s\u00e9ance table, where the spirit world is made of likes, shares, and endless scrolling.\n\n**Option 3:  Focus on the User Experience**\n\n> The scroll. The wait. The sudden rush of dopamine when the algorithm delivers. On TikTok, users aren't just consuming content, they're participating in a digital s\u00e9ance, their attention the offering, the \"For You\" page the cryptic message from beyond.\n\n**Option 4:  Metaphorical and Punchy**\n\n> TikTok: where the spirits aren't dead, they're viral.  Millions gather at the algorithmic s\u00e9ance table, hoping to be touched by the next big thing.\n\n**Tips for Choosing:**\n\n* **Consider your audience:** Who are you writing for? What tone will resonate with them?\n* **Think about the overall piece:** How does this lead set the stage for the rest of your writing?\n* **Read it aloud:** Does it sound natural and engaging?\n\n\n\nLet me know if you'd like to explore other variations or have a specific direction in mind!"
