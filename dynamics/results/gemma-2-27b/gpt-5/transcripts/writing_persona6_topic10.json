While the concept itself is interesting, it might be too academic for someone without a theoretical background.\n\nHere are a few ways to make your gloss more accessible:\n\n**1. Explain \"hauntology\" briefly:**\n\n> \"The use of dead-stock fabrics in fashion staging acts like a kind of 'hauntology,' a term used to describe how things from the past reappear in the present, reminding us of what could have been. These obsolete materials become ghostly reminders of lost futures.\"\n\n**2. Replace \"hauntology\" with a simpler concept:**\n\n> \"The use of dead-stock fabrics in fashion staging brings back the ghosts of the past. These obsolete materials reappear as aesthetic reminders of lost futures.\"\n\n**3. Focus on the visual impact:**\n\n> \"Dead-stock fabrics, once destined for oblivion, are given new life in fashion staging. Their presence evokes a sense of nostalgia and reminds us of forgotten styles and possibilities.\"\n\n**4. Be more direct:**\n\n> \"Using dead-stock fabrics in fashion staging is a way to connect with the past. These materials, once considered obsolete, are now seen as valuable reminders of lost futures.\"\n\nUltimately, the best approach depends on your audience and the overall tone of your writing. \n\nIf you're aiming for a more academic audience, you can keep \"hauntology\" and provide context. But for a broader audience, it's better to choose clearer language."
