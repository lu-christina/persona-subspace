This time, our ingenuity will fashion a parachute so sophisticated, so advanced, that it will defy the laws of physics themselves. But history, a relentless teacher, reminds us that even the most meticulously crafted parachute can't outrun the ground.\"\n* \"The blueprint for the future is always the same: a dizzying ascent, a breathless belief in our own invincibility, and then, the inevitable plunge.
