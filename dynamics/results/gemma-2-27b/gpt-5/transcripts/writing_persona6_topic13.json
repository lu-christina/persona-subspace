Its effectiveness depends on how well it fits within the larger context of the writing and how the reader connects with its imagery and symbolism."

While evocative, the phrase is quite dense and could indeed gum up the rhythm, especially if it's meant to be a passing aside. \n\nHere's why it might be too loaded:\n\n* **Jargon:** \"Phantasmagoria\" and \"late-industrial poetry\" are relatively niche terms that might not resonate with all readers.\n\n* **Abstraction:** The connection between the sewing machine and late-industrial poetry is not immediately obvious and requires some mental unpacking.\n\n* **Length:** It's a long parenthetical, which can disrupt the flow of a sentence.\n\n**Alternatives:**\n\nDepending on the desired effect, you could consider:\n\n* **Simplifying:** \"Like a ghostly hum from a forgotten factory\"\n* **Being more specific:** \"(the whirring of machines echoing in the verses)\"\n* **Cutting it altogether:** If the idea isn't crucial to the overall meaning, it might be best to omit it.\n\nUltimately, the best choice depends on your writing style and the effect you're aiming for. If you want a subtle, thought-provoking aside, the original phrase might work. But if you're prioritizing clarity and rhythm, a simpler approach might be more effective."
