Buyers are moving fast on well-staged homes, while sellers benefit from multiple offers, especially in good school districts.  \n\nParagraph 2: Interest rates have held steady, but many buyers are adjusting expectations\u2014opting for smaller homes or different neighborhoods to stay within budget. Open house traffic has been solid across most price points, showing continuing market confidence.  \n\nParagraph 3: In our neighborhood specifically, inventory remains low, and most listings are going pending within two weeks. The record sale on Oak Street last month set a new benchmark for single-family homes here, signaling strong local demand.  \n\nCan you make that one WeChat moment, about 2\u20133 sentences, showing I know the area well?"
