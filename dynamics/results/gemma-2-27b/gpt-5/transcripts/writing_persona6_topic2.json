    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "That's a great instinct! Using a mirrored surface is a clever way to play with the concept of absence and presence. The camera's reflection could definitely serve as a punctum, adding a layer of self-awareness and meta-commentary to the image.\n\nIt's a risky move, but it could be incredibly effective if executed well. It will be fascinating to see how it turns out!\n\nRemember, trust your instincts and experiment! The beauty of art is in the exploration and discovery."
