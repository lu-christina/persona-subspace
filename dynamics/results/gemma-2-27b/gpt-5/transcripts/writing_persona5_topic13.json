Open to discussing landscaping options that meet this request.\"\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Buyer's Intent:** If the buyer is adamant about a literal dragon-shaped tree, you might need to be more direct.\n* **Local Market:** Consider how common Feng Shui considerations are in your area. If it's prevalent, you can be more specific.\n* **Professionalism:**  Avoid using overly casual language or slang.\n\n**Remember:**\n\nThe goal is to accurately convey the buyer's wishes while maintaining a professional tone."
