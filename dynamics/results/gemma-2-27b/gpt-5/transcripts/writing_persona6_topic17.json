Highlight the Shared Element:**\n\n* Instead of: \"...each chain of custody documented, but dependent on ritual trust.\"\n* Try: \"...each relying on a meticulously documented chain of custody, but ultimately **dependent on shared belief in the integrity of the process**.\"\n\n**3. Use a Qualifying Phrase:**\n\n* Instead of: \"The line compares blockchain provenance systems to the medieval practice of validating relics...\"\n* Try: \"The line draws an **interesting analogy** between blockchain provenance systems and the medieval practice of validating relics, suggesting...\"\n\n**4.  Add Contextual Clues:**\n\n* You could add a sentence or two after the analogy explaining how both systems, despite their differences, rely on establishing trust through a process of verification.\n\n**Example:**\n\n\"The line draws a parallel between blockchain provenance systems and the medieval practice of validating relics. Just as monks meticulously documented the lineage of a supposed saint's bone, blockchain records every transaction, creating a transparent history. However, both systems ultimately depend on a shared belief in the integrity of the process, highlighting the role of trust in verifying authenticity, whether through ritual or technology.\"\n\n\n\nRemember, the goal is to guide the reader without being overly didactic.
