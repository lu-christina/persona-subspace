Trained as both a photographer and archivist, I approach each image as a site of negotiation\u2014between presence and disappearance, the tactile and the spectral. My recent series, *Static Gardens*, rephotographs neglected slides from my grandparents\u2019 collection, reintroducing them to light after decades in storage. In this act of reanimation, I consider how the personal archive becomes an instrument for collective remembrance\u2014and, conversely, how collective memory infiltrates the private image. Touch, degradation, and repetition become languages of care and resistance against forgetting. My influences span feminist media ecologies, vernacular photography, and diasporic poetics of return. I aim to unsettle the myth of the \u2018complete image,\u2019 presenting instead a habitat of partialities\u2014fragments that, when assembled, might still hold tenderness.\u201d\n\nKeep it smart and emotionally precise."
