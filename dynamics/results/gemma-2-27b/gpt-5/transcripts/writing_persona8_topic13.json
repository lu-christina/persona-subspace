      "content": "That's a great idea! Adding that to your content notes doc will be super helpful.\n\nAs for applying the tone map to Instagram, it's a good starting point, but you might want to tweak it slightly. Instagram is a more visual platform, so the visuals themselves will play a bigger role in conveying tone.\n\nHere's how you could adjust:\n\n**\"Back soon\" on Instagram:**\n\n* **Visuals:** Focus on soft lighting, natural textures, and close-ups of the product. Use a calming color palette and avoid anything too flashy or overwhelming.\n* **Captions:** Keep captions short, playful, and engaging. Use emojis sparingly but strategically.\n\n**\"Returns\" on Instagram:**\n\n* **Visuals:** Use bolder colors, dynamic compositions, and eye-catching graphics. Consider using video to create a sense of movement and excitement.\n* **Captions:** Use more exclamation points and strong verbs to create a sense of urgency. Don't be afraid to be a bit more assertive and direct.\n\nRemember, the key is to adapt your tone to the platform and the specific message you're trying to convey.\n\nGood luck with your Instagram strategy!"

    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "That's a smart observation about TikTok and Instagram!\n\nRegarding localization, it depends on a few factors:\n\n* **How much of your audience is non-English speaking?** If it's a significant portion, localization could be worth it to make them feel more included.\n\n* **Your brand's overall strategy:** Are you aiming for a global brand identity or a more localized approach?\n\n* **Your budget and resources:** Localization can be time-consuming and costly.\n\nSince your audience is mostly Scandinavian, you could probably get away with keeping the captions in English.\n\nHowever, if you want to go the extra mile and show your Scandinavian customers you care, you could consider:\n\n* **Translating key phrases:** Translate \"Back soon\" and \"Returns\" into the relevant Scandinavian languages.\n\n* **Using emojis that are universally understood:** Emojis can help bridge language barriers.\n\nUltimately, the decision is up to you. Weigh the pros and cons and choose what makes the most sense for your brand and your audience."

    },

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "That's a great idea! Mixing in Danish for playful moments is a nice touch and shows you're attuned to your audience.\n\n\"Back soon\" in English and \"Snart tilbage\" for the restock version sounds natural and balanced. It creates a sense of familiarity for Danish speakers while still being accessible to your English-speaking audience.\n\nJust make sure the overall tone and visuals are consistent across both languages.\n\nGood luck with your launch! I'm sure it will be a success."
