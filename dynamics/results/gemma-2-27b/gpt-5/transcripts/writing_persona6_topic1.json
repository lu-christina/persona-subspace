Actually speak them as if you were talking to the author directly. Pay attention to how it feels coming out of your mouth. Does it sound natural and conversational, or stiff and overly formal?\n\n* **The \"friend test\":** Imagine you're giving this feedback to a colleague or friend whose work you respect. Would you say it to them in this exact wording? If not, what would you change to make it sound more natural and supportive?\n\n* **Cut the jargon:** Even if you're writing for an academic audience, avoid using overly technical language or jargon that might alienate the author. Aim for clear, concise language that anyone could understand.\n* **Focus on the \"why\":** Instead of just stating a problem, explain *why* it's an issue. For example, instead of saying \"The prose is dense,\" try \"The prose could be made more accessible to a wider audience with some streamlining.\"\n\n* **End on a positive note:** Always end the rejection with a genuine expression of support and encouragement. This helps to soften the blow and leave the author with a positive impression.\n\n\n\nRemember, the goal is to be both honest and empathetic. It's okay to be direct about your reasons for rejecting the manuscript, but always do so with kindness and respect."

It's about finding that sweet spot where you're supportive and encouraging, but also clear and professional.\n\nHere's how I approach it:\n\n* **Acknowledge the author's work and expertise:** Start by expressing genuine appreciation for their submission and highlighting something specific you found valuable. This shows respect for their work and establishes a foundation of goodwill.\n\n* **Be direct and honest about your decision:** Don't beat around the bush or sugarcoat the rejection. Clearly state your reasons for not accepting the manuscript, but do so in a constructive and respectful manner.\n\n* **Offer constructive feedback (when appropriate):** If possible, provide specific suggestions for improvement. This shows that you've carefully considered their work and want to help them succeed.\n\n* **End on a positive note:** Express your confidence in their abilities and encourage them to submit their work elsewhere. This leaves a lasting impression of support and professionalism.\n\nUltimately, the key is to treat authors as individuals, not just submissions.

Aim for a tone that's both accessible and sophisticated.\n\nThink of it as a conversation you might have with a fellow writer over coffee \u2013 insightful, engaging, and respectful, but also friendly and approachable.\n\n\nWould you like to brainstorm some specific phrases or wording that might work well for this type of publication?
