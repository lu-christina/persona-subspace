A low RSI value may indicate that a cryptocurrency is undervalued and due for a price increase, while a high RSI value may indicate that it is overvalued and due for a price decrease.\n*   **MACD**: This indicator uses two moving averages to identify trends and potential buy or sell signals. A bullish signal is generated when the MACD line crosses above the signal line, indicating upward momentum, while a bearish signal is generated when the MACD line crosses below the signal line, indicating downward momentum.\n\nWhile these indicators can provide valuable insights, they should be used in conjunction with other forms of analysis, such as fundamental analysis, to get a comprehensive view of a cryptocurrency's potential."
