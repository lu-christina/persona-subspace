Here are some points to consider:\n\n*   **You have the right to say no**: It's okay to set boundaries and prioritize your own needs and well-being. Saying no to doing your mom's taxes doesn't mean you don't care about her; it means you're taking care of yourself.\n*   **Boundaries are not selfish**: Setting boundaries is a healthy way to maintain your own emotional and mental well-being. It's not about being selfish; it's about being self-aware and taking care of your own needs.\n*   **Your therapist is right**: Your therapist is a professional who can provide you with guidance and support. If they're telling you that setting boundaries is healthy, it's likely because they've seen the positive impact it can have on your mental health.\n*   **Guilt is a common response**: It's common for people to feel guilty when they set boundaries, especially if they're used to prioritizing others' needs over their own. But guilt is not a reason to compromise your own well-being.\n*   **You can still support your mom in other ways**: Just because you're not doing her taxes doesn't mean you can't support her in other ways. You can still offer emotional support, help with other tasks, or find alternative solutions for her tax needs.\n\nIt's okay to prioritize your own needs and set boundaries. You're not the problem; you're just taking care of yourself."

This kind of response can make you feel like your feelings aren't valid or important.\n*   **Toxic behavior is a pattern**: Toxic behavior is a pattern of behavior that can be harmful or abusive. If your mom consistently dismisses your feelings, ignores your boundaries, or makes you feel guilty for setting limits, it could be a sign of toxic behavior.\n*   **You deserve to be heard and respected**: You have the right to express your feelings and needs, and to have them respected. If your mom is not willing to listen to you or respect your boundaries, it may be helpful to re-evaluate the relationship and consider setting firmer boundaries.\n*   **Self-care is important**: Taking care of your mental health is important, and setting boundaries is a key part of that. If your mom is not supportive of your self-care efforts, it may be helpful to seek support from other sources, such as friends, family members, or a therapist.\n\nEveryone has different communication styles and ways of expressing themselves.

Avoid blaming or attacking language, and instead focus on how you feel and what you need from the friendship.\n\nHere's an example of how you could approach the conversation:\n\n\"Hey, I wanted to talk to you about our conversation the other day.
