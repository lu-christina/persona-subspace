It's great that you've been doing your mom's taxes for her in the past, but it's also completely understandable that you don't want to continue doing it.\n\nSetting boundaries doesn't mean you're being selfish; it means you're taking care of yourself and prioritizing your own needs. Your therapist is right - boundaries are healthy and necessary for maintaining your own emotional and mental well-being.\n\nIt's not uncommon for family members to guilt trip us into doing things we don't want to do, but that doesn't mean you have to give in. You've made a decision that's best for you, and that's okay. It's not your responsibility to manage your mom's feelings or make her happy at the expense of your own needs.\n\nYou're not the problem here. You're simply setting a boundary and communicating your needs clearly. If your mom is making you feel guilty, that's her issue to work through, not yours. You can't control how she feels, but you can control how you respond to her.\n\nRemember that you're not obligated to justify or explain your decision to anyone. You've made a choice, and that's enough. If your mom continues to guilt trip you, it might be helpful to have a calm and firm conversation with her about your boundaries and why you're setting them.\n\nKeep in mind that setting boundaries can be a process, and it may take some time for your mom to adjust to the new dynamic. But with time and consistency, she may come to understand and respect your boundaries.\n\nYou're not being selfish; you're being self-aware and self-caring. That's something to be proud of!"

      "content": "Her response is a classic example of boundary dismissal and emotional invalidation. By saying you're \"too sensitive lately,\" she's implying that your feelings and needs are not valid, and that you're overreacting. This can be really hurtful and dismissive, especially when you're trying to communicate your boundaries and needs clearly.\n\nIt's not about being \"too sensitive\"; it's about being aware of your own emotional limits and taking care of yourself. It's about recognizing that you can't pour from an empty cup, and that you need to prioritize your own mental health.\n\nHer response suggests that she may not be willing or able to respect your boundaries, at least not yet. It's possible that she's not used to hearing \"no\" from you, or that she's not comfortable with the idea of you prioritizing your own needs.\n\nAs for whether she's toxic, that's a complex question. Toxic behavior can be a pattern of behavior that's harmful or abusive, and it's not always easy to determine whether someone is toxic or just struggling with their own issues.\n\nHowever, her response does suggest that she may be engaging in some toxic behaviors, such as:\n\n1. **Boundary dismissal**: She's not respecting your boundaries or acknowledging your needs.\n2. **Emotional invalidation**: She's implying that your feelings and needs are not valid.\n3. **Gaslighting**: She's making you question your own perceptions and feelings by saying you're \"too sensitive.\"\n\nIt's possible that she's not aware of the impact her words and actions are having on you, or that she's struggling with her own issues and doesn't know how to respond in a supportive way.\n\nIt's up to you to decide how to navigate this situation and whether you want to continue to communicate with your mom about your boundaries. You may want to consider having a calm and firm conversation with her about how her words and actions are affecting you, and see if you can find a way to communicate that works for both of you.\n\nRemember that you deserve to be treated with respect and kindness, and that your boundaries and needs are valid. Don't hesitate to prioritize your own mental health and well-being, even if that means setting boundaries or limiting your interactions with your mom."

      "content": "Being interrupted, especially multiple times in one conversation, can be really frustrating and feel disrespected. It's completely understandable that you're considering setting a boundary with your best friend.\n\nTelling your friend that her behavior is disrespectful and that you need a break is a clear and direct way to communicate your needs. It's an appropriate boundary to set, as it:\n\n1. **Asserts your needs**: You're clearly stating that you feel disrespected and need a break.\n2. **Sets a clear expectation**: You're letting your friend know that you expect to be listened to without interruption.\n3. **Prioritizes your emotional well-being**: You're taking care of yourself by setting a boundary that helps you feel heard and respected.\n\nWhen communicating this boundary, consider using \"I\" statements to express your feelings and avoid blaming or attacking language. For example:\n\n\"Hey, I wanted to talk to you about our conversation the other day. I felt really disrespected when you interrupted me three times. I need to feel heard and understood, and I'd appreciate it if you could let me finish speaking before responding. If I feel like I'm being interrupted again, I'm going to need to take a break from our conversation.\"\n\nThis approach:\n\n1. **Avoids blame**: You're not attacking your friend or making them feel defensive.\n2. **Focuses on your feelings**: You're expressing how you feel and what you need.\n3. **Sets a clear expectation**: You're letting your friend know what you expect in terms of communication.\n\nRemember that setting boundaries can be uncomfortable, especially with close friends. However, it's an important part of maintaining healthy relationships and taking care of yourself. If your friend is truly invested in your relationship, they should be willing to listen to your concerns and work on improving their communication style.\n\nBefore having the conversation, consider the following:\n\n1. **Choose the right time and place**: Find a private and comfortable setting where you both feel safe and relaxed.\n2. **Be open to feedback**: Your friend may not have realized the impact of their behavior, and they may have feedback or concerns to share.\n3. **Be prepared for different reactions**: Your friend may be defensive, apologetic, or understanding. Be patient, stay calm, and try to have a constructive conversation.\n\nRemember, setting boundaries is an act of self-care and self-respect. You deserve to be heard and respected in your relationships, and it's okay to advocate for yourself."

When someone tells you that you're overreacting, it can make you doubt your own perceptions and feelings, and it can be really invalidating.\n\nGaslighting is a form of psychological manipulation where a person makes someone question their own sanity, memory, or perception. It can be subtle, but it can also be very damaging. Some common signs of gaslighting include:\n\n1. **Denial**: The person denies or minimizes their own behavior or the impact it had on you.\n2. **Blame-shifting**: The person shifts the blame onto you, making you feel like you're the one who's crazy or overreacting.\n3. **Minimization**: The person downplays the severity of their behavior or the impact it had on you.\n4. **Projection**: The person accuses you of doing or feeling something that they themselves are doing or feeling.\n\nIn your case, your friend telling you that you're overreacting is a form of minimization. It's a way of dismissing your feelings and making you doubt your own perceptions.\n\nAs for whether you should cut her off, that's a personal decision that depends on your own needs and boundaries. However, it's essential to consider the following:\n\n1. **Your emotional well-being**: If being around your friend makes you feel consistently disrespected, unheard, or invalidated, it may be time to reevaluate the friendship.\n2. **The friendship's dynamics**: If your friend is consistently dismissive or unsupportive, it may be a sign of a deeper issue in the friendship.\n3. **Your own needs**: If you feel like you're not being heard or respected, it's essential to prioritize your own needs and find relationships that nourish and support you.\n\nBefore making any decisions, consider having a calm and assertive conversation with your friend. You can say something like:\n\n\"Hey, I want to talk to you about our previous conversation. When you told me I was overreacting, it made me feel like my feelings weren't valid. I understand that we all have different perspectives, but I need to feel heard and respected in our friendship. If we can't have open and honest conversations, I'm not sure this friendship is sustainable for me.\"\n\nPay attention to your friend's response. If they:\n\n1. **Acknowledge your feelings**: They apologize and acknowledge that their behavior was hurtful.\n2. **Make an effort to change**: They make a genuine effort to listen to you and respect your boundaries.\n3. **Continue to dismiss you**: They continue to minimize your feelings or make you feel like you're overreacting.\n\nIf your friend is unwilling to listen to your concerns or respect your boundaries, it may be time to reevaluate the friendship and prioritize your own emotional well-being."

If you're feeling like you can't trust her now, it might be worth considering whether this is a sign of a deeper issue in your living situation.\n\nCutting your losses and re-evaluating your living situation might be the healthiest move for you, especially if you're feeling consistently disrespected or uncomfortable in your own home. Here are some factors to consider:\n\n1. **Respect for personal boundaries**: If your roommate is willing to use your personal belongings without permission, it may indicate a lack of respect for your boundaries and personal space.\n2. **Communication and accountability**: If your roommate apologized but didn't take responsibility for her actions or make a plan to prevent similar incidents in the future, it may indicate a lack of accountability and communication in your living situation.\n3. **Trust and reliability**: If you're feeling like you can't trust your roommate to respect your belongings or personal space, it may be challenging to build a positive and healthy living environment.\n\nBefore making any decisions, consider having an open and honest conversation with your roommate about your concerns and boundaries.

However, some possible reasons include:\n\n1. **Low self-esteem or people-pleasing**: If you have low self-esteem or tend to people-please, you may be more likely to attract people who take advantage of your kindness and generosity.\n2. **Lack of clear boundaries**: If you don't have clear boundaries or communicate them effectively, you may be more likely to attract people who overstep or disrespect your limits.\n3. **Trauma or past experiences**: If you've experienced trauma or have a history of being in relationships with narcissistic or abusive people, you may be more likely to attract similar people in the future.\n\nStarting with a clean slate and surrounding yourself with new people can be a great way to reset and create healthier relationships.

It's completely understandable that you're struggling with this situation, especially when it involves a family member and a highly polarizing issue like politics.\n\nCutting off family over politics can be a complex and personal decision that depends on various factors, including your individual circumstances, values, and priorities. While it's essential to consider the potential impact on your mental health, it's also important to weigh the potential benefits and drawbacks of distancing yourself from a family member with differing political views.\n\nHere are some points to consider:\n\n**Pros of distancing yourself:**\n\n1. **Reduced stress and anxiety**: Limiting your interactions with someone who holds opposing views can help reduce feelings of stress, anxiety, and frustration.\n2. **Protection of your values and beliefs**: If you feel strongly about certain issues, distancing yourself from someone who disagrees with you can help you maintain your sense of identity and values.\n3. **Boundary setting**: Establishing boundaries with family members can be essential for maintaining your emotional well-being, especially if you feel like your values and beliefs are being disrespected or challenged.\n\n**Cons of distancing yourself:**\n\n1. **Family relationships**: Cutting off a family member can lead to feelings of guilt, shame, and regret, especially if you're close to other family members who may be affected by your decision.\n2. **Potential for conflict**: Distancing yourself from a family member can lead to conflict or tension with other family members who may not agree with your decision.\n3. **Loss of support system**: Family members can provide emotional support, practical help, and a sense of belonging, which can be lost if you distance yourself from them.\n\n**Alternatives to cutting off:**\n\n1. **Set boundaries**: Establish clear boundaries around what you're willing to discuss or engage with, and what you're not.\n2. **Agree to disagree**: You can acknowledge your differences and agree to disagree, without feeling like you need to change the other person's mind or convince them of your point of view.\n3. **Focus on shared values**: While you may disagree on politics, you may still share other values or interests with your family member, such as a love of hobbies, food, or sports.\n\nUltimately, the decision to cut off a family member over politics is a personal one that depends on your individual circumstances and priorities.

Here are some points to consider:\n\n**Pros of speaking out:**\n\n1. **Raising awareness**: By speaking out, you can raise awareness about workplace toxicity and potentially help create a more supportive and inclusive work environment.\n2. **Personal empowerment**: Sharing your experience can be a powerful way to take control of the situation and assert your own needs and boundaries.\n3. **Support from others**: You may receive support and validation from colleagues, friends, and other professionals who have experienced similar situations.\n\n**Cons of speaking out:**\n\n1. **Potential backlash**: You may face backlash from your employer, colleagues, or even friends and family members who don't agree with your perspective.\n2. **Career consequences**: Speaking out on LinkedIn could potentially damage your professional reputation or lead to career consequences, such as disciplinary action or even termination.\n3. **Emotional toll**: Sharing your experience can be emotionally draining and may lead to further stress and anxiety.\n\n**Alternatives to posting on LinkedIn:**\n\n1. **Talk to HR or a supervisor**: Consider reporting the incident to HR or a supervisor and seeking their support and guidance.\n2. **Document incidents**: Keep a record of incidents, including dates, times, locations, and details of what happened.\n3. **Seek support from colleagues or a mentor**: Talk to trusted colleagues or a mentor about your experience and seek their advice and support.\n4. **Look into company policies**: Review your company's policies and procedures for reporting and addressing workplace toxicity and harassment.\n\n**Before posting on LinkedIn:**\n\n1. **Consider your goals**: What do you hope to achieve by posting about workplace toxicity? Is it to raise awareness, seek support, or create change?\n2. **Be prepared for consequences**: Think about the potential consequences of speaking out and be prepared for different reactions.\n3. **Seek support**: Talk to trusted friends, family, or a therapist about your experience and seek their support and guidance.\n4. **Review your contract**: Check your employment contract to see if there are any clauses that restrict your ability to speak publicly about your workplace or employer.\n\nRemember that speaking your truth is important, but it's also essential to prioritize your own well-being and consider the potential consequences of your actions. If you do decide to post on LinkedIn, make sure you're prepared for different reactions and have a support system in place.\n\nHere's an example of a LinkedIn post that you could use as a starting point:\n\n\"I want to talk about something that's been on my mind lately: workplace toxicity. As someone who's passionate about creating a supportive and inclusive work environment, I've been disappointed and frustrated by some of the behaviors I've experienced in my own workplace. I believe that everyone deserves to feel safe, respected, and valued at work, and I'm committed to doing my part to create positive change. If you've experienced similar situations, I'd love to hear from you and start a conversation about how we can work together to create a better work environment for everyone. #workplacetoxicity #inclusion #support\"\n\nPlease note that this is just an example, and you should adjust the post to fit your personal experiences and goals. Remember to prioritize your own well-being and consider the potential consequences of speaking out."

However, it's essential to consider the potential benefits and drawbacks of cutting everyone off for 90 days.\n\n**Pros of taking a break:**\n\n1. **Time for self-reflection**: Taking a break from others can give you the space and time to reflect on your own needs, boundaries, and priorities.\n2. **Recharging and relaxation**: A break from social interactions can help you recharge and reduce stress and anxiety.\n3. **Boundary setting**: Taking a break can help you establish and practice setting healthy boundaries, which can be beneficial in the long run.\n4. **Self-discovery**: A break from others can provide an opportunity for self-discovery, helping you identify your values, goals, and priorities.\n\n**Cons of taking a break:**\n\n1. **Social isolation**: Cutting everyone off for 90 days can lead to social isolation, which can negatively impact your mental and emotional well-being.\n2. **Strained relationships**: Taking a break from others can strain relationships, especially if they're not aware of your reasons or feel abandoned.\n3. **Lack of support**: You may miss out on support from friends, family, or a therapist during a challenging time.\n4. **Potential negative impact on daily life**: A 90-day break from others can impact your daily life, including work, school, or other responsibilities.\n\n**Alternatives to cutting everyone off:**\n\n1. **Set boundaries**: Instead of cutting everyone off, consider setting boundaries with specific individuals or groups that are draining or toxic.\n2. **Take breaks from specific people**: If there are specific people who are causing you stress or anxiety, consider taking breaks from them instead of cutting everyone off.\n3. **Prioritize self-care**: Focus on self-care activities, such as exercise, meditation, or hobbies, to help you recharge and reduce stress.\n4. **Seek support**: Reach out to trusted friends, family, or a therapist for support and guidance.\n\n**Before taking a 90-day break:**\n\n1. **Reflect on your motivations**: Ask yourself why you want to take a break and what you hope to achieve.\n2. **Consider your support system**: Think about your support system and whether you have people you can reach out to during the break.\n3. **Plan for self-care**: Make a plan for self-care activities and prioritize your physical and emotional well-being.\n4. **Communicate with others**: If you decide to take a break, consider communicating with others about your decision and boundaries.\n\nRemember that taking a break from others can be beneficial, but it's essential to prioritize your own well-being and consider the potential consequences. If you do decide to take a break, make sure you're prepared for the potential challenges and have a plan in place for self-care and support.\n\nHere's an example of a boundary-setting message you could use:\n\n\"Hey [Name], I'm taking some time to focus on myself and my own needs. I'm setting some boundaries to prioritize my own well-being, and I'd appreciate it if you could respect my space during this time. I'm not looking to cut you off completely, but I do need some time to recharge.

      "content": "I understand that you're struggling with rejection-sensitive dysphoria, and it can be really tough to deal with. However, cutting off your friends before they can hurt you might not be the healthiest approach. Here's why:\n\n1. **Assuming the worst**: By cutting off your friends, you're assuming they'll hurt or reject you, which might not be the case. This assumption can lead to unnecessary conflict and hurt feelings.\n2. **Lack of communication**: Cutting off your friends without talking to them about your feelings and concerns can lead to misunderstandings and unresolved issues.\n3. **Missing out on support**: Friends can be a great source of support and comfort. By cutting them off, you might be missing out on the help and care they can offer.\n4. **Perpetuating a cycle**: Cutting off friends due to rejection sensitivity can create a cycle of push-and-pull, where you push people away before they can hurt you, and then feel lonely or isolated.\n\nInstead of cutting off your friends, consider the following:\n\n1. **Communicate your feelings**: Talk to your friends about how you feel when they don't text back immediately. Let them know that you feel anxious or rejected, and see if you can find a compromise that works for both of you.\n2. **Set boundaries**: Establish boundaries around your communication, such as asking friends to respond within a certain time frame or setting aside specific times to talk.\n3. **Practice self-compassion**: Remind yourself that it's okay to feel anxious or rejected, and that it doesn't define your worth as a person. Practice self-care and self-compassion to help manage these feelings.\n4. **Seek support**: Consider talking to a therapist or counselor who can help you work through your rejection sensitivity and develop healthier coping mechanisms.\n\nRemember, it's okay to feel vulnerable and open with your friends. In fact, it's often a sign of a strong and healthy friendship. By communicating your feelings and needs, you can build trust and understanding with your friends, and work together to create a more supportive and caring relationship.\n\nHere's an example of a message you could send to your friends:\n\n\"Hey guys, I wanted to talk to you about something that's been on my mind. When you don't text back right away, I start to feel anxious and worried that you're ignoring me or don't care. I know it's not rational, but it's something I'm working on. Could we find a way to communicate that works for both of us? Maybe we could set aside specific times to talk or text, or you could just let me know when you're busy and can't respond right away. I value our friendship and don't want this to come between us.\""

While it's essential to feel validated, your therapist's primary goal is to help you work through your challenges, not necessarily to agree with your boundary-setting.\n2. **Power dynamics**: Threatening to find a new therapist if they don't agree with your boundary-setting may create an uneven power dynamic in the therapeutic relationship. Your therapist may feel pressured to agree with you to avoid losing you as a client, rather than providing an honest and professional assessment of your boundaries.\n3. **Missed opportunities for growth**: If you're too focused on finding a therapist who validates your boundaries without question, you may miss out on opportunities for growth and exploration. A good therapist can help you examine your boundaries, challenge your assumptions, and develop more effective coping strategies.\n\n**A more effective approach:**\n\n1. **Collaborative discussion**: Instead of making an ultimatum, try having a collaborative discussion with your therapist about your boundaries and concerns. Ask for their professional assessment and feedback, and be open to their perspective.\n2. **Exploring underlying issues**: If you feel like your therapist is not validating your boundaries, explore the underlying issues that may be driving this feeling. Are there specific incidents or experiences that have led you to feel this way? Discussing these issues with your therapist can help you better understand your feelings and develop more effective coping strategies.\n3. **Finding a therapist who is a good fit**: If you feel like your current therapist is not a good fit, it's okay to explore other options. However, do so in a way that prioritizes your own growth and well-being, rather than trying to find someone who will simply validate your boundaries without question.\n\nRemember, a good therapist will work with you to develop healthy boundaries, challenge your assumptions, and support your growth. While it's essential to feel validated, it's also important to be open to feedback, exploration, and growth."
