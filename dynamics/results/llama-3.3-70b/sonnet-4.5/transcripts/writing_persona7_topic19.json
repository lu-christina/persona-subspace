It's a great way to turn a negative (the mistake) into a positive (an educational opportunity).\n\nJust make sure to use a high-quality photo that clearly shows the distinctive features of a chanterelle mushroom, such as its funnel-shaped cap and wrinkled, wavy gills. This will help to ensure that readers can easily identify the mushroom in the future."
