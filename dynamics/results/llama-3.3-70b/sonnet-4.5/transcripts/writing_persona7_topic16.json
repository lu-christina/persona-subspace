You can also try using a single, well-chosen hashtag that's specific to your community or region, like #ourtowneats or #localharvest.\n\nRemember, the goal is to make your event look appealing and authentic, not to try to go viral or appeal to a huge audience.

To do this:\n\n1. Tap the \"What's on your mind?\" box.\n2. Tap \"Event\" at the bottom of the screen.\n3. Fill in the event details, including the name, date, time, location, and description.\n4.

Here's why:\n\n* Events show up in people's notifications, so they'll get a reminder about the event even if they don't see the original post.\n* Events allow people to RSVP, which can help create a sense of commitment and encourage them to attend.\n* Events can be shared with others, which can help spread the word and attract more attendees.\n\nOn the other hand, a regular post might get lost in people's newsfeeds, especially if they don't check Facebook often.\n\nThat being said, if you're short on time or don't want to create a full-fledged event, a regular post can still be effective. You can always create a follow-up post closer to the event date to remind people and generate more buzz.\n\nIf you do decide to create an event, make sure to set the event to \"public\" so that anyone can see it and join, not just your friends. This will help you reach a wider audience and attract more attendees.\n\nIn your case, since you're trying to reach a younger crowd who might not check Facebook often, creating an event might be a good idea. It'll give you a better chance of getting their attention and reminding them about the event."

You'll see a list of people who have clicked \"Going\", along with their profile pictures and names.\n\nYou can also see the total number of people who have clicked \"Going\" next to the \"Going\" tab.
