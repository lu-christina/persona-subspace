Use a generic or fictional product packaging design to avoid referencing specific brands. Highlight the differences in labeling, certifications, or ingredients to illustrate the contrast.\n2. **Infographic icons**: Design a simple infographic with icons or graphics that represent different aspects of sustainability, such as renewable energy, recycling, or eco-friendly materials. Use a \"checkmark\" or \"tick\" icon to indicate which aspects are genuinely sustainable, and a \"cross\" or \"X\" icon to indicate which ones are being greenwashed.\n3. **Before-and-after scenario**: Create a visual representation of a product's lifecycle, showing how a greenwashed product might claim to be sustainable but actually has a negative impact on the environment. Then, show a revised version of the product with genuinely sustainable practices, highlighting the positive changes.\n4. **Label comparison**: Design a mock product label with exaggerated or misleading eco-claims, and then show a revised label with more accurate and transparent information. This can help illustrate the difference between greenwashing and genuine sustainability without referencing specific brands.\n5. **Simple graphics**: Use simple graphics or illustrations to represent the concept of greenwashing, such as a tree with a fake or superficial \"green\" layer, versus a tree with a genuine, thriving ecosystem. This approach can be more abstract and thought-provoking, encouraging viewers to think critically about sustainability claims.\n\nRemember to keep the visual simple, clear, and easy to understand, and avoid using language or imagery that could be perceived as confrontational or accusatory.
