This approach should help you avoid raising any eyebrows while still accurately representing your client's wishes.\n\nIf you need to be more specific, you could also consider adding a note or a comment in the MLS, such as:\n\n\" Buyer is looking for a property with a unique tree feature, preferably with a shape that resembles a dragon. This can be achieved through custom pruning or shaping of an existing tree, or the installation of a new tree with a sculpted design.\"\n\nBy framing it in this way, you're providing context and clarifying the client's request without making it sound too... unconventional."
