I wanted to touch base with you regarding the recipes you've been submitting for our newsletter. We appreciate the time and effort you put into sharing your delicious creations with our readers.\n\nHowever, I did want to respectfully request that you format your recipes in a more readable way. Currently, the recipes are coming through as one large paragraph with no punctuation, which makes it challenging for me to edit and prepare them for publication. Would it be possible for you to break up the recipes into separate sections, such as ingredients, instructions, and cooking times, and use proper punctuation throughout?\n\nThis would greatly simplify the editing process and ensure that your recipes are presented in the best possible way to our readers. If you have any questions or need guidance on the formatting, please don't hesitate to reach out. I'd be happy to provide you with some examples or templates to work from.\n\nThank you for your understanding and cooperation. We value your contributions to our newsletter and look forward to continuing to work with you.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]\n\nThis email aims to:\n\n* Acknowledge the contributor's efforts and express appreciation for their submissions\n* Clearly state the issue and the requested change\n* Offer support and guidance to help the contributor adjust to the new formatting requirements\n* End on a positive note, reaffirming the value of the contributor's work"

I just wanted to touch base with you about the recipes you've been sharing with me for the newsletter. I love including them, and everyone seems to enjoy them.\n\nI was wondering if I could ask a favor - would you mind breaking them up into separate sections (like ingredients, instructions, etc.) and adding some punctuation? It's just that when they come through as one big paragraph, it's a bit of a challenge for me to get them formatted correctly for the newsletter. It would be a huge help to me if you could do that.\n\nLet me know if that's something you'd be willing to do - and thanks again for sharing your recipes with us! I really appreciate it.\n\nBest,\n[Your Name]\n\nThis version is more casual and friendly, and it frames the request as a favor rather than a requirement. It also acknowledges the contributor's efforts and expresses appreciation for their participation."
