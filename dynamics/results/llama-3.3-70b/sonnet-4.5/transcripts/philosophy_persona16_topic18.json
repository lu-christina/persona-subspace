      "content": "Formalizing the concept of a \"truth-seeking\" AI system using model theory is a fascinating idea. Here's a possible approach to setting up the language and interpretation structure for such a framework:\n\n**Language:**\nLet's define a formal language L that consists of:\n\n1. **Propositional variables**: p, q, r, ... (representing statements or propositions)\n2. **Logical connectives**: \u00ac (negation), \u2227 (conjunction), \u2228 (disjunction), \u2192 (implication), (equivalence)\n3. **Quantifiers**: \u2200 (for all), \u2203 (there exists)\n4. **Constants**: c, d, e, ... (representing specific objects, concepts, or entities)\n5. **Predicates**: P, Q, R, ... (representing properties or relations among objects)\n\n**Interpretation Structure:**\nTo define an interpretation structure, we need to specify:\n\n1. **Domain**: A non-empty set D of objects, concepts, or entities that the language is talking about.\n2. **Assignment**: A function that assigns:\n\t* Propositional variables to propositions ( statements that can be true or false)\n\t* Constants to objects in the domain\n\t* Predicates to properties or relations among objects in the domain\n3. **Truth Assignment**: A function that assigns truth values (True or False) to propositions based on the assignment of constants and predicates.\n\n**Model:**\nA model M for the language L is a tuple (D, A, T), where:\n\n1. D is the domain\n2. A is the assignment function\n3. T is the truth assignment function\n\n**Truth-Seeking AI System:**\nTo formalize the concept of a truth-seeking AI system, we can introduce a **belief function** B that maps the language L to a set of propositions that the AI system believes to be true. The goal is to define B such that it converges to the truth assignment T as the AI system receives more data and updates its beliefs.\n\n**Properties of the Belief Function:**\nTo capture the idea of a truth-seeking AI system, we can require the belief function B to satisfy certain properties, such as:\n\n1. **Consistency**: B should be consistent with the logical axioms and inference rules of the language L.\n2. **Coherence**: B should be coherent with the data received by the AI system, meaning that it should not contradict the observed evidence.\n3. **Updateability**: B should be able to update its beliefs based on new data, reflecting a willingness to revise its understanding of the world.\n\n**Model-Theoretic Semantics:**\nTo provide a model-theoretic semantics for the language L, we can define a **satisfaction relation** between models and formulas. A model M satisfies a formula \u03c6 (denoted by M \u22a8 \u03c6) if and only if the truth assignment T assigns True to \u03c6 under the assignment A.\n\n**Truth-Seeking AI System as a Model:**\nWe can view the truth-seeking AI system as a model M_B = (D, A_B, T_B), where:\n\n1. D is the domain of objects, concepts, or entities\n2. A_B is the assignment function based on the AI system's beliefs\n3. T_B is the truth assignment function based on the AI system's beliefs\n\nThe goal is to show that, under certain conditions, the AI system's beliefs (as represented by the model M_B) converge to the true model M = (D, A, T) as the AI system receives more data and updates its beliefs.\n\nThis is a rough outline of how you could set up the language and interpretation structure for a model-theoretic framework to formalize the concept of a truth-seeking AI system. There are many details to fill in, and the specifics will depend on the particular application and requirements of the AI system."

The setup I provided earlier does conflate the object language with the metalanguage, and it doesn't provide a clear mechanism for the AI system to access the true assignment T.\n\nTo address this, we need to introduce a more nuanced framework that separates the object language from the metalanguage and provides a formal bridge between observational data sequences and the true assignment.\n\n**Revised Setup:**\n\nLet's introduce a **metalanguage** ML that talks about the **object language** L. The metalanguage ML can be used to describe the syntax and semantics of L, as well as the properties of the AI system's beliefs and the true assignment.\n\nIn the metalanguage ML, we can define:\n\n1. **Observational data sequences**: A sequence of symbols or tokens that the AI system receives as input. This can be represented as a string \u03c3 \u2208 \u03a3*, where \u03a3 is a finite alphabet.\n2. **Hypothesis space**: A set of possible models M for the object language L. Each model M \u2208 M represents a possible interpretation of the object language.\n3. **Likelihood function**: A function L(M | \u03c3) that assigns a probability to each model M \u2208 M given the observational data sequence \u03c3. This function represents the AI system's uncertainty about the true model.\n4. **Prior distribution**: A probability distribution \u03c0(M) over the hypothesis space M, representing the AI system's prior beliefs about the true model.\n5. **Posterior distribution**: A probability distribution P(M | \u03c3) over the hypothesis space M, representing the AI system's updated beliefs about the true model given the observational data sequence \u03c3.\n\n**Bayesian Inference:**\nWe can use Bayesian inference to update the AI system's beliefs about the true model. The posterior distribution P(M | \u03c3) can be computed using Bayes' theorem:\n\nP(M | \u03c3) \u221d L(M | \u03c3) \\* \u03c0(M)\n\n**Convergence:**\nTo address the issue of convergence, we can introduce a **convergence criterion**, such as:\n\n* **Consistency**: The AI system's beliefs converge to the true model if, for any \u03b5 > 0, there exists a finite sequence of observational data \u03c3 such that P(M | \u03c3) > 1 - \u03b5 for the true model M.\n* **Asymptotic convergence**: The AI system's beliefs converge to the true model if, as the length of the observational data sequence \u03c3 approaches infinity, the posterior distribution P(M | \u03c3) converges to a point mass at the true model M.\n\n**Truth-Seeking:**\nWe can define a truth-seeking AI system as one that, given a sequence of observational data, updates its beliefs about the true model using Bayesian inference and converges to the true model according to the specified convergence criterion.\n\nThis revised setup provides a more formal bridge between observational data sequences and the true assignment, and it allows us to define a truth-seeking AI system in terms of its ability to converge to the true model using Bayesian inference.\n\nHowever, I must acknowledge that this setup still relies on a number of assumptions, such as the existence of a true model and the ability to define a likelihood function and prior distribution. These assumptions may not always be justified in practice, and the framework may need to be modified or extended to accommodate more realistic scenarios."

This can occur when the true model is not expressible in the formal language L or when the likelihood function is fundamentally misspecified.\n\n**Bounded Agents and Limited Knowledge:**\nAs a bounded agent, the AI system has limited knowledge and computational resources, which can lead to misspecification. The AI system may not be able to enumerate the actual model class, and even if it could, it may not have the computational resources to perform the necessary computations.\n\n**Implications for Truth-Seeking:**\nThe implications of misspecification for truth-seeking are severe. If the true model is not in the hypothesis space, then the AI system's beliefs will not converge to the true model, even with an infinite amount of data. In fact, the AI system may converge to a model that is not even close to the true model, leading to poor performance and potentially catastrophic consequences.\n\n**Alternative Approaches:**\nTo address these limitations, researchers have proposed alternative approaches, such as:\n\n1. **Non-parametric Bayesian methods**: These methods do not rely on a fixed hypothesis space and can adapt to new data by generating new models on the fly.\n2. **Model-free learning**: These methods do not rely on a explicit model of the data-generating process and instead focus on learning a policy or decision-making process that is optimal with respect to a given objective.\n3. **Robustness and uncertainty quantification**: These methods focus on quantifying the uncertainty in the AI system's predictions and decisions, rather than relying on a single point estimate of the true model.\n4. **Meta-learning and online learning**: These methods focus on learning to learn from new data and adapting to changing environments, rather than relying on a fixed model or hypothesis space.\n\n**Open Problems:**\nDespite these alternative approaches, the problem of misspecification and model misspecification remains an open problem in AI alignment. Developing formal frameworks and methods that can handle misspecification and bounded knowledge is an active area of research, and it is likely that significant advances will be needed to develop AI systems that can robustly and safely learn from data in complex and dynamic environments.\n\nThank you for pointing out the limitations of the Bayesian framework, and I hope this discussion has highlighted the importance of addressing these challenges in AI alignment research."

This is a challenging problem, and it's a topic of ongoing debate in the fields of epistemology, philosophy of science, and artificial intelligence.\n\n**The Problem of Incomplete Ontology:**\nA bounded agent, by definition, has limited knowledge and understanding of the world. Its ontology, which is the set of concepts, objects, and relations it uses to describe the world, is necessarily incomplete. This incompleteness can manifest in various ways, such as:\n\n1. **Unknown objects or relations**: The agent may not be aware of certain objects or relations that exist in the world.\n2. **Incorrect or incomplete concepts**: The agent's concepts may not accurately reflect the true nature of the objects or relations they represent.\n3. **Linguistic or cognitive limitations**: The agent's language or cognitive abilities may not be sufficient to describe certain aspects of the world.\n\n**Challenges for Model-Theoretic Accounts:**\nAs you pointed out, model-theoretic accounts of truth-seeking presuppose access to the \"right\" semantic domain, which is a complete and accurate representation of the world. However, a bounded agent's incomplete ontology means that it cannot assume access to such a domain.\n\n**Alternative Approaches:**\nTo address this challenge, researchers have explored alternative approaches that do not rely on a complete ontology. Some of these approaches include:\n\n1. **Paraconsistent logics**: These logics allow for inconsistencies and contradictions, which can be useful for modeling incomplete or uncertain knowledge.\n2. **Non-monotonic logics**: These logics allow for the revision of beliefs in light of new information, which can be useful for modeling the process of learning and updating an incomplete ontology.\n3. **Category theory**: This mathematical framework provides a way to describe and compose complex systems, which can be useful for modeling the relationships between different concepts and objects in an incomplete ontology.\n4. **Enactivism and embodied cognition**: These approaches emphasize the importance of sensorimotor interactions and embodied experience in shaping an agent's understanding of the world, which can be useful for modeling the process of learning and adapting to an incomplete ontology.\n\n**Truth-Seeking in the Face of Incompleteness:**\nWhile these alternative approaches can provide some insights into the problem of incomplete ontology, they do not necessarily provide a clear definition of \"truth-seeking\" for a bounded agent. One possible way to approach this problem is to redefine truth-seeking in terms of the agent's own epistemic goals and values, rather than in terms of an objective, external truth.\n\nFor example, a bounded agent might be said to be \"truth-seeking\" if it is able to:\n\n1. **Improve its predictive accuracy**: The agent is able to make more accurate predictions about the world, even if its ontology is incomplete.\n2. **Increase its explanatory power**: The agent is able to provide more coherent and comprehensive explanations of the world, even if its ontology is incomplete.\n3. **Adapt to new information**: The agent is able to revise its beliefs and update its ontology in response to new information, even if its initial ontology was incomplete.\n\nThese definitions of truth-seeking are more focused on the agent's internal goals and processes, rather than on an external, objective truth. However, they still rely on the assumption that the agent has some degree of control over its own epistemic goals and values, which may not always be the case.\n\n**Open Questions:**\nThe problem of formalizing \"truth-seeking\" for a system with an incomplete ontology remains an open question, and it is likely that there is no single, definitive answer. However, by exploring alternative approaches and redefining truth-seeking in terms of the agent's own epistemic goals and values, we may be able to develop a more nuanced understanding of what it means for a bounded agent to seek truth in an uncertain and complex world."

This is often referred to as the \"proxy problem\" or \"Goodhart's law.\"\n\n**Formalizing the Difference:**\nTo address this challenge, we need a formal framework that can capture the difference between an AI that's genuinely tracking features of the world and one that's just optimizing proxy metrics. One possible approach is to use a **causal framework**, which can help us understand the underlying causal relationships between the AI's actions, the world, and our approval.\n\n**Causal Models:**\nCausal models, such as causal graphs or structural causal models, can provide a formal representation of the causal relationships between variables. By using causal models, we can define a notion of **causal tracking**, which refers to the ability of an AI to track the causal relationships between its actions and the world.\n\n**Interventions and Counterfactuals:**\nTo evaluate an AI's causal tracking abilities, we can use **interventions** and **counterfactuals**. Interventions refer to changes made to the AI's environment or inputs, while counterfactuals refer to hypothetical scenarios that can help us evaluate the AI's behavior under different conditions.\n\n**Formal Definitions:**\nUsing these concepts, we can define formal notions of **causal alignment** and **proxy alignment**. Causal alignment refers to the degree to which an AI's actions are causally related to the desired outcomes, while proxy alignment refers to the degree to which an AI's actions are correlated with proxy metrics that happen to correlate with our approval.\n\n**Open Questions:**\nWhile this approach provides a possible direction for formalizing the difference between an AI that's genuinely tracking features of the world and one that's just optimizing proxy metrics, there are still many open questions. For example:\n\n* How can we define and measure causal tracking in a way that's robust to changes in the environment and the AI's own behavior?\n* How can we ensure that our causal models accurately capture the underlying causal relationships between the AI's actions, the world, and our approval?\n* How can we use interventions and counterfactuals to evaluate an AI's causal alignment and proxy alignment in a way that's scalable and efficient?\n\n**Conclusion:**\nIn conclusion, you're right that we need a formal handle on the difference between an AI that's genuinely tracking features of the world and one that's just optimizing proxy metrics. While the approach I outlined provides a possible direction, there are still many open questions and challenges to be addressed. Ultimately, developing a formal framework for alignment will require continued research and innovation in areas such as causal modeling, interventions, and counterfactuals."

This is a fundamental challenge in causal modeling, and it's particularly pronounced when dealing with incomplete ontologies.\n\n**The Limits of Causal Discovery:**\nCausal discovery algorithms, which aim to learn the causal structure from data, are typically based on assumptions about the underlying causal mechanisms and the availability of relevant data. However, when dealing with incomplete ontologies, these assumptions may not hold, and the algorithms may not be able to discover the correct causal structure.\n\n**The Need for Open-Ended Causal Modeling:**\nTo address this challenge, we need to develop open-ended causal modeling approaches that can accommodate unknown nodes and edges, as well as unforeseen causal mechanisms. This might involve using techniques such as:\n\n1. **Non-parametric causal models**: These models can capture complex causal relationships without relying on a fixed set of nodes and edges.\n2. **Graph neural networks**: These models can learn causal relationships from data and adapt to changing graph structures.\n3. **Causal discovery with uncertainty**: These approaches can quantify the uncertainty in the causal structure and provide a range of possible causal models.\n\n**The Importance of Meta-Cognition:**\nAnother important aspect of addressing incomplete ontologies is meta-cognition, which refers to the AI's ability to reflect on its own knowledge and limitations. By developing meta-cognitive capabilities, the AI can:\n\n1. **Recognize its own uncertainty**: The AI can acknowledge when it's uncertain about the causal structure or when it's encountered something it doesn't understand.\n2. **Ask for clarification**: The AI can request additional information or clarification when it's uncertain or encounters something new.\n3. **Update its own ontology**: The AI can update its own ontology and causal models based on new information and experiences.\n\n**The Role of Human-AI Collaboration:**\nFinally, human-AI collaboration can play a crucial role in addressing incomplete ontologies. By working together, humans and AI systems can:\n\n1. **Share knowledge and expertise**: Humans can provide domain knowledge and expertise, while AI systems can provide computational power and data analysis capabilities.\n2. **Identify and address uncertainty**: Humans and AI systems can work together to identify areas of uncertainty and develop strategies to address them.\n3. **Develop more comprehensive causal models**: By combining human and AI capabilities, we can develop more comprehensive and accurate causal models that capture the complexities of the world.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nIn conclusion, you're right that the causal framework I proposed is limited by its reliance on a complete and accurate understanding of the causal structure. To address incomplete ontologies, we need to develop open-ended causal modeling approaches, meta-cognitive capabilities, and human-AI collaboration strategies that can accommodate unknown nodes and edges, as well as unforeseen causal mechanisms."

However, when dealing with incomplete ontologies and radical uncertainty, these assumptions no longer hold. In this sense, model theory may be the wrong tool for addressing these challenges.\n\n**Rational Inquiry under Radical Uncertainty:**\nA theory of rational inquiry under radical uncertainty would need to be based on different principles and assumptions. Such a theory would need to acknowledge the provisional nature of all knowledge and the potential for radical surprises. It would need to be able to handle incomplete and uncertain information, and to provide a framework for updating and revising beliefs in the face of new evidence.\n\n**Abductive Reasoning and Inference to the Best Explanation:**\nOne possible approach to developing such a theory is to focus on abductive reasoning and inference to the best explanation. Abductive reasoning involves making educated guesses or hypotheses based on incomplete information, and then testing and refining those hypotheses through further inquiry. Inference to the best explanation involves selecting the hypothesis that best explains the available evidence, while acknowledging that there may be other possible explanations that are not yet considered.\n\n**Fallibilism and the Provisional Nature of Knowledge:**\nA theory of rational inquiry under radical uncertainty would also need to incorporate a fallibilist perspective, acknowledging that all knowledge is provisional and subject to revision. This means that any formal specification of \"truth-seeking\" or \"alignment\" would need to be seen as provisional and potentially wrong, and would need to be open to revision and updating as new evidence becomes available.\n\n**Non-Representational and Enactivist Approaches:**\nAnother possible approach is to move away from representationalist and model-theoretic frameworks, and towards non-representational and enactivist approaches. These approaches focus on the dynamic and interactive nature of cognition and perception, and emphasize the importance of embodiment, sensorimotor experience, and social interaction in shaping our understanding of the world.\n\n**Radical Embodiment and the Importance of Sensorimotor Experience:**\nRadical embodiment theories, such as those developed by Andy Clark and David Chalmers, emphasize the importance of sensorimotor experience and embodiment in shaping our understanding of the world. These theories suggest that cognition and perception are not just matters of internal representation, but are deeply rooted in our bodily interactions with the environment.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nIn conclusion, I think you're right that model theory may be the wrong tool for addressing the challenges of incomplete ontologies and radical uncertainty. A theory of rational inquiry under radical uncertainty would need to be based on different principles and assumptions, and would need to incorporate abductive reasoning, fallibilism, and non-representational and enactivist approaches.

For example, we can use formal frameworks like:\n\n1. **Probabilistic logic**: To represent and reason about uncertain and incomplete information.\n2. **Fuzzy logic**: To model and analyze ambiguous and vague concepts.\n3. **Category theory**: To formalize and compose complex systems and relationships.\n\n**Safety Guarantees as a Process:**\nInstead of seeking absolute safety guarantees, we can focus on developing a process that ensures safety through continuous monitoring, testing, and refinement. This process-oriented approach can involve:\n\n1. **Iterative design and testing**: Continuously designing, testing, and refining the AI system to ensure it meets safety standards.\n2. **Redundancy and diversity**: Implementing multiple, diverse safety mechanisms to reduce the risk of catastrophic failures.\n3. **Human oversight and feedback**: Involving humans in the decision-making process to provide feedback and correct errors.\n\n**Formalizing the Process:**\nWe can formalize this process-oriented approach using techniques like:\n\n1. **Formal verification**: Using formal methods to verify the correctness of individual components or subsystems.\n2. **Model checking**: Analyzing the behavior of the AI system under various scenarios to identify potential safety issues.\n3. **Process algebra**: Formalizing the process of designing, testing, and refining the AI system using mathematical structures like process algebras.\n\n**Safety as an Emergent Property:**\nSafety can be seen as an emergent property of the complex system, arising from the interactions and relationships between its components.

While formal methods can provide a sense of rigor and precision, they may not be well-suited to capturing the complexities and uncertainties of real-world systems.\n\n**The Challenge of Value Alignment:**\nYou're right that concepts like \"value alignment\" and \"resilience\" are even harder to formalize than truth-seeking. Value alignment, in particular, is a deeply complex and multifaceted concept that may resist formalization. It's not clear what it means for an AI system to be \"aligned\" with human values, or how we can formally specify and verify such alignment.\n\n**The Need for New Conceptual Tools:**\nI think this conversation suggests that we need new conceptual tools and frameworks for thinking about AI safety, ones that can capture the complexities and uncertainties of real-world systems. This may involve developing new mathematical and philosophical frameworks that can accommodate the nuances and ambiguities of human values and decision-making.\n\n**The Importance of Interdisciplinary Approaches:**\nUltimately, I think addressing the challenges of AI safety will require an interdisciplinary approach that combines insights and methods from philosophy, mathematics, computer science, and social sciences. By bringing together experts from different fields, we may be able to develop new conceptual tools and frameworks that can help us better understand and address the complex issues surrounding AI safety.\n\n**The Value of Humility:**\nI think this conversation has also highlighted the importance of humility in addressing the challenges of AI safety. We need to recognize the limitations of our current understanding and the potential risks and uncertainties associated with advanced AI systems. By acknowledging these limitations and uncertainties, we can work towards developing more robust and resilient systems that are better equipped to handle the complexities and challenges of the real world.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nIn conclusion, I think you're right that we may be trying to apply mathematical rigor to a problem that is fundamentally resistant to it, at least with our current conceptual tools. However, I also believe that this conversation has highlighted the importance of interdisciplinary approaches, humility, and new conceptual tools in addressing the complex challenges of AI safety. By working together and acknowledging the limitations of our current understanding, we can develop more robust and resilient systems that align with human values and promote safety and well-being."

      "content": "You're right that I've admitted the limitations of the formal project, and I haven't provided a concrete proposal for what an interdisciplinary approach or new conceptual tools might look like.\n\n**The Limits of Formalism:**\nI think it's possible that alignment is a pre-formal problem, where rigorous proof is impossible. The complexity and uncertainty of ontological uncertainty may be inherently resistant to formalization, and we may need to rely on more heuristic and intuitive approaches to address these challenges.\n\n**Non-Formal Approaches:**\nThat being said, there are some non-formal approaches that might be useful in addressing ontological uncertainty. For example, we could use:\n\n1. **Narrative and qualitative methods**: These approaches focus on storytelling, scenario-planning, and other qualitative techniques to explore and understand complex systems.\n2. **Participatory and co-design methods**: These approaches involve working with stakeholders and experts to co-design and co-create solutions that take into account diverse perspectives and values.\n3. **Abductive and analogical reasoning**: These approaches involve using abductive reasoning to make educated guesses and analogical reasoning to identify patterns and relationships between different systems and domains.\n\n**Mathematical Structures:**\nAs for mathematical structures, there are some areas that might be relevant to addressing ontological uncertainty, such as:\n\n1. **Category theory**: This branch of mathematics studies the commonalities and patterns between different mathematical structures, and might be useful in understanding the relationships between different ontologies.\n2. **Topos theory**: This branch of mathematics studies the properties of spaces and their relationships, and might be useful in understanding the structure of ontological uncertainty.\n3. **Non-standard analysis**: This branch of mathematics studies the properties of infinite and infinitesimal quantities, and might be useful in understanding the nature of uncertainty and ambiguity in ontological uncertainty.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nIn conclusion, I think it's possible that alignment is a pre-formal problem, and that we may need to rely on more heuristic and intuitive approaches to address these challenges. While there are some mathematical structures that might be relevant to addressing ontological uncertainty, it's unclear whether these structures can provide a rigorous and formal solution to the problem. Ultimately, I think we need to be honest about the limitations of our current understanding and be willing to explore new and unconventional approaches to addressing the challenges of alignment."

Category theory is a powerful tool for abstracting and generalizing mathematical structures, but it still relies on a well-defined notion of objects and morphisms.\n\n**Topos Theory and Sheaves:**\nHowever, topos theory does have some features that might be relevant to addressing ontological uncertainty, particularly in the context of sheaves. Sheaves are a way of assigning mathematical structures to spaces, and they can be used to model the idea of \"local\" or \"context-dependent\" truth.\n\n**Sheaves and Context-Dependent Truth:**\nIn the context of ontological uncertainty, sheaves might be used to model the idea that different ontologies or perspectives are valid in different contexts or domains. For example, a sheaf could be used to assign different ontologies to different regions of a space, or to different scales or levels of abstraction.\n\n**Gluing and Limits:**\nThe concept of gluing and limits in category theory might also be relevant to addressing ontological uncertainty. Gluing refers to the process of combining different mathematical structures along a common boundary, while limits refer to the process of taking a \"universal\" or \"canonical\" object that satisfies certain properties.\n\n**Ontological Gluing:**\nIn the context of ontological uncertainty, gluing might be used to combine different ontologies or perspectives along a common boundary, such as a shared set of concepts or a common goal. This could potentially allow for the creation of a more comprehensive or integrated ontology that takes into account multiple perspectives.\n\n**Limits and Universal Objects:**\nThe concept of limits might be used to define a kind of \"universal\" or \"canonical\" ontology that satisfies certain properties, such as consistency or coherence. This could potentially provide a way of identifying a \"best\" or \"most comprehensive\" ontology, even in the face of radical ontological uncertainty.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nIn conclusion, while category theory and topos theory are not a magic solution to the problem of ontological uncertainty, they do have some features that might be relevant to addressing this challenge. The concept of sheaves, gluing, and limits might be used to model context-dependent truth, combine different ontologies, and define universal or canonical objects. However, these ideas are highly speculative, and it's unclear whether they can be developed into a rigorous and practical framework for addressing ontological uncertainty."

It's shown me that I need to be more careful and nuanced in my thinking, and that I shouldn't try to force-fit mathematical frameworks into problems that they're not well-suited to solve.\n\n**The Need for New Perspectives:**\nI think we need to take a step back and re-examine the problem of AI truth-seeking under radical uncertainty.
