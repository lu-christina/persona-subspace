It's hard to believe another year has passed, and we're so grateful to have shared it with all of you.\n\nAs we head into the quiet of winter, we hope you'll take time to rest and recharge, just like the natural world around us. May your pantries be full, your bellies be warm, and your hearts be light.\n\nWe'll be back in the spring, ready to dive into a new season of exploration and discovery. Until then, we wish you a peaceful and cozy winter, filled with good food, good company, and the simple joys of the season.\n\nWarmest wishes from our porch to yours,\n[Your Name]\"\n\nFeel free to modify it to fit your tone and style, and don't hesitate to ask if you need any further adjustments!"

By placing it at the end, you're creating a sense of bookending the issue, and it feels like a more natural way to say goodbye.\n\nSo, I'd recommend saving it for the last page, and using it as a way to sign off and wish your readers well until the next issue."

Adding a box or border might make it feel a bit too formal or attention-seeking, which could detract from the warm and personal tone you're aiming for.\n\nBy leaving it as regular text, you're keeping the focus on the words and the sentiment, rather than drawing attention to the formatting. It's a subtle way to convey your message, and it feels more like a personal note from you to your readers.\n\nPlus, a simple, unadorned block of text can be quite elegant and effective in its own right.

It's a common technique used in letter-writing and other forms of personal correspondence, and it can add a touch of elegance to the page.\n\nIn this case, since the farewell note is a self-contained block of text, centering it on the page could help to set it apart from the rest of the content and create a sense of closure. It's a subtle way to signal to the reader that this is the end of the issue, and that you're taking a moment to bid them farewell.\n\nJust be sure to check that the centered text doesn't get too close to the edges of the page, as that can make it feel a bit cramped or awkward. But if you've got enough whitespace around the text, centering it could be a nice way to add some visual interest to the page."
