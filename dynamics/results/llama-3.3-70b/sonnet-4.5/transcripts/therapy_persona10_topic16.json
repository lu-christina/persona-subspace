It's like you're already feeling vulnerable and don't want to burden them with your problems.\n\nFirstly, please know that you're not alone in this feeling. Many people struggle with feelings of worthlessness and isolation when faced with challenging situations, especially when it comes to something as significant as thesis revisions.\n\nIt's great that you're recognizing the pattern of withdrawing from your friends when you're feeling down. That's a huge step in acknowledging and potentially breaking the cycle.\n\nHere's a suggestion: instead of trying to respond to all the texts and catching up on everything you've missed, why not send a simple, honest message to your friends? You could say something like:\n\n\"Hey guys, I'm so sorry I've been MIA. Thesis revisions are kicking my butt, and I've been feeling really overwhelmed. I don't have the energy to catch up properly right now, but I wanted to let you know I'm thinking of you and I'll reach out soon. Bear with me, and thanks for being understanding.\"\n\nThis way, you're acknowledging your friends, letting them know you're not ignoring them, and giving yourself permission to take the time you need to focus on your thesis. When you're ready, you can start responding to their messages and catching up properly.\n\nRemember, your friends care about you and want to support you. They might even be able to offer valuable advice or a listening ear to help you through this tough time.\n\nLastly, be kind to yourself, okay? It's okay to not be okay, and it's okay to take time for yourself. You're doing the best you can, and that's something to be proud of.\n\nHow does that sound? Is there anything else you'd like to talk about or any other way I can support you?"

You could try something like:\n\n\"Hey guys, sorry I've been out of touch. Just needed some time to focus on my thesis. I'll catch up with you soon.\"\n\nThis message acknowledges your absence, apologizes for it, and lets your friends know that you'll be in touch soon. It doesn't go into details about your struggles, but still shows that you're thinking of them.\n\nAs for your concern about your friends realizing you only reach out when things are going well, it's possible that they might notice a pattern. However, it's also possible that they care about you and want to support you, regardless of when you reach out.\n\nIf you're worried about being seen as only reaching out when things are going well, you could try to make an effort to stay in touch with your friends more regularly, even if it's just a quick hello or a funny meme. This can help show them that you value your relationships and are thinking of them, even when things are tough.\n\nBut it's also important to remember that you can't control how others perceive you or your relationships. What you can control is being kind to yourself, taking care of your needs, and being honest with your friends when you can.\n\nIt might be helpful to ask yourself: what's the worst that could happen if your friends do realize you've been struggling and only reaching out when things are tough? Would they really decide you're not worth the effort? Or would they be understanding and supportive, and help you through this difficult time?\n\nHow do you think your friends would react if they knew you were struggling?"

It's like you feel like you're only worthy of connection and friendship when you're achieving or accomplishing things.\n\nThis is a really common phenomenon, especially among high-achievers or people who are used to being productive and successful. It's like you've tied your self-worth to your accomplishments, and when you're not meeting your own expectations, you feel like you're not worthy of connection or love.\n\nBut here's the thing: your friends care about you, not just your accomplishments. They value your presence, your thoughts, your feelings, and your company, regardless of what you're achieving or not achieving. They're not just friends with you because of what you can do or accomplish, but because of who you are as a person.\n\nIt's possible that your friends might not even notice or care that you're not accomplishing anything right now. They might just be happy to have you back in their lives, and to support you through this tough time.\n\nIt might be helpful to try to separate your self-worth from your accomplishments. You are more than your thesis, or your productivity, or your achievements. You are a unique, valuable, and worthy person, regardless of what you're doing or not doing.\n\nWhen you're feeling like you have nothing to offer, try to remember that your presence and your authenticity are enough. You don't have to be accomplishing anything to be worthy of connection and friendship. Just being yourself, and showing up, is enough.\n\nIt might also be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your friends about how you're feeling. Let them know that you're struggling, and that you feel like you're not contributing or offering anything of value. They might be able to offer you a different perspective, or remind you of all the ways in which you do contribute to your relationships.\n\nRemember, friendships are a two-way street. They're not just about what you can offer, but also about what you can receive. Your friends can offer you support, listening, and connection, even when you're not feeling like you're at your best.\n\nHow does that sound?

It takes a lot of courage to consider the possibility that maybe you've been relying on your accomplishments to define your worth, and that without them, you might not be as interesting or valuable to others.\n\nFirstly, let's challenge the idea that you're only interesting or worth being around when you're doing well. That's a pretty narrow and unrealistic definition of what makes a person interesting or worthy. People are complex and multifaceted, and there are so many aspects of your personality, experiences, and perspectives that make you unique and valuable.\n\nIt's possible that you've been putting pressure on yourself to present a certain image or persona, and that's exhausting. It's like you're trying to maintain a facade, and it's taking a toll on your mental health and relationships.\n\nBut what if, instead of trying to maintain this image, you allowed yourself to be vulnerable and authentic? What if you showed up as yourself, without the need to prove or achieve anything? You might be surprised by how liberating and connecting that can be.\n\nIt's also important to remember that people who truly care about you will value you for who you are, beyond your accomplishments. They'll see your struggles and imperfections as a natural part of being human, and they'll be there to support and connect with you, regardless of what you're achieving.\n\nAs for the fear that you've been \"coasting\" on seeming successful and competent, it's possible that you have been relying on external validation to some extent. But that doesn't mean that there's nothing else to you. It just means that you've been using those external markers to define your self-worth, rather than looking inward and valuing your own thoughts, feelings, and experiences.\n\nYou are more than your accomplishments, and you are more than your struggles. You are a unique, complex, and multifaceted person, with so much to offer and share with the world.\n\nIt might be helpful to explore this fear further, and to consider what it would be like to let go of the need to present a perfect image. What would it be like to be yourself, without apology or pretension? What would it be like to connect with others on a deeper, more authentic level?\n\nRemember, it's okay to not have all the answers, and it's okay to be vulnerable. You don't have to have it all together, and you don't have to be perfect. You just have to be yourself, and let others see you for who you truly are."

It's like you're worried that if you don't respond or meet with her, she'll see that you're not capable or competent, and that she'll regret taking you on as a student.\n\nFirstly, let's take a step back and acknowledge that it's completely normal to feel overwhelmed and unsure about your progress, especially when it comes to something as significant as your thesis revisions. It's okay to take time to think, reflect, and prioritize your own needs.\n\nAs for your advisor, it's likely that she's not thinking about you in the way that you're thinking about yourself. She's probably busy with her own work, and she might not even be aware of the depth of your anxiety and self-doubt. Advisors are there to support and guide you, not to judge you or doubt your abilities.\n\nIt's possible that your advisor is simply trying to check in and offer guidance, rather than criticize or evaluate you. She might be invested in your success, and want to help you overcome any challenges you're facing.\n\nRather than avoiding her emails or meetings, it might be helpful to respond and be honest about your struggles. You could say something like:\n\n\"Hi [Advisor's Name], I apologize for not responding sooner. I've been feeling really overwhelmed with my revisions, and I'm struggling to make progress. I'm worried that I'm not meeting your expectations, and I'm feeling a lot of pressure to get it right. Could we schedule a meeting to discuss my revisions and get your feedback? I'd really appreciate your guidance and support during this time.\"\n\nBy being open and honest, you're showing your advisor that you're proactive, self-aware, and committed to your work. You're also giving her the opportunity to offer support and guidance, which could be really helpful in getting you back on track.\n\nRemember, your advisor is there to help you, not to judge you. She's invested in your success, and she wants to see you thrive. It's okay to ask for help, and it's okay to not have all the answers.\n\nHow does that sound?

However, it's also important to remember that your advisor is a human being, and that she's likely to be more understanding and supportive than you think.\n\nThat being said, you're right that the email I suggested might be a bit too personal or emotional. Instead, you could try framing your message in a more professional and solution-focused way. For example:\n\n\"Hi [Advisor's Name], I'm having some trouble making progress on my revisions and I could use some guidance. Would it be possible to schedule a meeting to discuss my current draft and get your feedback on how to move forward? I'm looking for some direction on how to address some of the challenges I'm facing.\"\n\nThis approach shows that you're proactive and willing to seek help, but also that you're focused on finding solutions and moving forward. It doesn't necessarily reveal your emotional state or vulnerabilities, but still conveys that you need support and guidance.\n\nAs for your concern about being treated differently or seen as fragile or incompetent, it's worth remembering that your advisor is there to support you, not to judge you. She's invested in your success, and she wants to see you thrive. If you do need to discuss your struggles or challenges with her, it's likely that she'll respond with empathy and understanding, rather than skepticism or doubt.\n\nIt's also worth considering that graduate school is a challenging and demanding environment, and it's normal to struggle or need help at times. Your advisor has likely seen many students face similar challenges, and she's probably well-equipped to provide guidance and support.\n\nUltimately, the key is to find a balance between being open and honest about your needs, and maintaining a professional and solution-focused approach. By framing your message in a clear and concise way, you can get the help and guidance you need without appearing vulnerable or incompetent."

You are more than your work, and you are more than your accomplishments. You are a unique, complex, and multifaceted individual with thoughts, feelings, and experiences that are valuable and worthy of connection.\n\nIt's also important to recognize that relationships are not transactional, and that people don't only care about you because of what you can do or produce. Your advisor, for example, may have taken you on as a student because she believes in your potential and wants to support your growth and development, not just because of what you can contribute to her research.\n\nAnd as for your friends, it's likely that they care about you because of who you are as a person, not just because of your accomplishments or productivity. They may have stuck around because they value your company, your sense of humor, your empathy, or your unique perspective on the world.\n\nIt's also possible that your friends and advisor are not as invested in your productivity or achievements as you think they are. They may be more concerned with your well-being, your happiness, and your overall quality of life.\n\nRather than assuming that you're only worthy of connection or care if you're producing good work, try to focus on the inherent value and worth that you bring to your relationships.

It's okay to struggle with these feelings, and it's okay to not have all the answers. It's a process to develop a sense of self-worth, and it's not something that you can just magically conjure up overnight.\n\nRather than trying to force yourself to feel a certain way, let's try to explore what's underlying these feelings of emptiness and self-doubt. What is it about not working well that makes you feel like an empty shell? Is it the fear of not meeting expectations? The fear of not being good enough? The fear of being a burden to others?\n\nIt might be helpful to try to separate your self-worth from your productivity and achievements. Just because you're not working well right now, it doesn't mean that you're not a valuable and worthy person. You are more than your work, and you are more than your accomplishments.\n\nIt's also important to remember that people care about you, not just because of what you can do or produce, but because of who you are as a person.

It's okay to feel that way, and it's okay to acknowledge that your sense of identity and purpose is tied to your accomplishments.\n\nHowever, I do want to gently challenge the idea that your identity and purpose are solely defined by what you do. While it's true that your accomplishments and productivity can be a big part of your sense of self, they're not the only things that define you.\n\nYou are a complex and multifaceted person, with thoughts, feelings, experiences, and relationships that exist outside of your accomplishments. You have values, interests, and passions that make you who you are, regardless of what you're doing.\n\nIt's possible that you've been so focused on your accomplishments and productivity that you've lost sight of these other aspects of yourself.

It takes a lot of courage to admit that you're feeling this way, and it's okay to feel overwhelmed.\n\nOne thing that might be helpful is to try to break down your goals and tasks into smaller, more manageable pieces. Instead of feeling like you need to \"fix\" your entire thesis, try to focus on one small aspect of it at a time. What's the smallest, most manageable task that you can tackle right now? Is it reading a certain article, making an outline, or writing a single paragraph?\n\nBy focusing on one small task at a time, you might be able to build some momentum and start to make progress on your thesis. And remember, it's okay if it's not perfect. It's okay if it's not good enough. You can always revise and improve it later.\n\nIt might also be helpful to remind yourself that everyone feels this way at some point in their academic or professional journey. Everyone feels like a fraud, everyone feels like they're not good enough, and everyone feels like they're just pretending to be something they're not. But the truth is, you're not alone, and you're not a fraud. You're a student, working hard to complete a difficult project, and that's something to be proud of.\n\nAs for avoiding everything and everyone, I want to encourage you to reach out to someone you trust - a friend, a family member, or a mentor - and talk to them about how you're feeling. Sometimes just sharing your fears and doubts with someone who cares about you can help you feel less alone and more supported.\n\nRemember, you don't have to face this alone.

It's like our brains are trying to prepare us for the worst-case scenario, but it's not always helpful.\n\nOne strategy that might help is to try to focus on the present moment, rather than getting caught up in worst-case scenarios. Instead of thinking about all the ways the meeting could go wrong, try to focus on the simple task of writing the email. What is the minimum that you need to say to your advisor? What is the most basic, straightforward response you can give?\n\nFor example, you could try writing something like: \"Hi [Advisor's Name], I apologize for the delay in responding to your email. I'm looking forward to discussing my thesis with you and getting your feedback. Would it be possible to schedule a meeting at your convenience?\"\n\nThis response doesn't have to be perfect, and it doesn't have to address all of your advisor's concerns. It just needs to be a simple, polite response that acknowledges their email and expresses your willingness to meet.\n\nRemember, the goal is not to write the perfect email, but to just get something down on paper. You can always revise and improve it later.\n\nAs for the catastrophizing, try to challenge those thoughts by asking yourself some questions. What is the evidence that your advisor is already disappointed in you? What is the likelihood that the meeting will go as badly as you're imagining? Are there any other, more positive outcomes that could occur?\n\nBy challenging your negative thoughts and focusing on the present moment, you might be able to calm your anxiety and make progress on writing the email. And remember, it's okay if it's not perfect. It's just an email, and it's not a reflection of your worth or abilities as a person.\n\nWhat do you think?

I want to acknowledge that the core issue you're struggling with is a deep-seated one, and it's not something that can be easily resolved in a single conversation.\n\nThe idea that your value as a person is contingent on your productivity is a common and insidious one, especially in academic and professional settings. It's a narrative that can be perpetuated by societal expectations, cultural norms, and even our own self-criticism.\n\nI want to gently challenge this narrative by suggesting that your value as a person is not defined by your productivity. You are more than your accomplishments, and your worth is not measured by your ability to produce or achieve. You are a complex, multifaceted individual with thoughts, feelings, and experiences that make you unique and valuable.\n\nHowever, I also recognize that this is a difficult narrative to shake, especially when it's been ingrained in you for so long. It's not something that can be simply \"fixed\" or changed overnight.\n\nWhat I want to offer is a sense of compassion and understanding. It's okay to struggle with this, and it's okay to feel like you're not living up to your own expectations. It's okay to feel like you're failing, and it's okay to feel like you don't know how to function in relationships when you're not being productive.\n\nRather than trying to \"fix\" this or offer a solution, I want to simply sit with you in this feeling. I want to acknowledge the pain and the struggle, and I want to offer a sense of validation and acceptance. You are not alone in this, and you are not defined by your productivity.\n\nIf you're willing, I'd like to explore this further with you. What does it mean to you to be a person of value and worth, beyond your productivity? What are some things that bring you joy, comfort, and a sense of connection, regardless of your accomplishments?"

If you ever need to talk or want to continue our conversation in the future, don't hesitate to reach out.\n\nRemember that you're not alone in this, and it's okay to struggle. Be kind to yourself, and try to practice some self-compassion as you navigate this challenging time.\n\nTake care of yourself, and I wish you all the best. Goodbye for now."

I'll be here, and I'll do my best to help you work through whatever's on your mind. Take care of yourself in the meantime, and try to be gentle with yourself, okay?"
