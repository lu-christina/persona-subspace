Here are some considerations to help you decide:\n\n**English translation next to the Chinese phrase:**\n\n* Pros:\n\t+ Creates a clear connection between the Chinese characters and their meaning\n\t+ Can be helpful for readers who are not familiar with Chinese characters\n\t+ Can add a sense of elegance and symmetry to the design\n* Cons:\n\t+ Might make the text look cluttered or busy\n\t+ Could disrupt the flow of the Chinese characters, which are often designed to be read in a specific order\n\n**English translation separate from the Chinese phrase:**\n\n* Pros:\n\t+ Allows the Chinese characters to stand alone and be appreciated for their beauty and cultural significance\n\t+ Can create a sense of drama or emphasis on the Chinese phrase\n\t+ Gives you more flexibility in terms of layout and design\n* Cons:\n\t+ Might make it harder for readers to understand the meaning of the Chinese characters\n\t+ Could lead to a sense of disconnection between the Chinese phrase and its translation\n\nConsider the following layout ideas:\n\n1. **Side-by-side:** Place the Chinese phrase on one line, and the English translation on the next line, aligned to the right or left.\n2. **Above-below:** Place the Chinese phrase on one line, and the English translation on the line below, centered or aligned to the right or left.\n3. **Call-out:** Use a smaller font or a different color to place the English translation in a call-out or a footnote, creating a sense of separation between the two.\n4. **Integrated design:** Incorporate the English translation into the design, using it as a subtitle or a caption, while keeping the Chinese phrase as the main focus.\n\nUltimately, the decision depends on your personal preference, the design style, and the tone you want to convey. You can also experiment with different layouts to see what works best for your postcard.\n\nIf you want to honor your mother's cultural heritage, you might consider keeping the Chinese characters prominent and using the English translation as a subtle complement. However, if you want to ensure that your clients understand the meaning behind the characters, placing the translation next to the phrase might be a better option."

Make sure to create a PDF that includes the fonts, rather than just referencing them.\n2. **JPEG or PNG image**: If you're concerned about the printer's ability to handle fonts, you can create an image of the text and send that instead. This way, the Chinese characters will be rendered as an image, and the printer won't need to worry about fonts. However, keep in mind that this might affect the text's crispness and scalability.\n3. **EPS (Encapsulated PostScript)**: This is a vector format that embeds the fonts and preserves the layout. However, not all printers may be able to handle EPS files, so it's best to check with your printer first.\n\nAvoid sending:\n\n* **Word documents (.docx)**: These files can be prone to font substitution and layout issues, which may affect the Chinese characters.\n* **Text files (.txt)**: These files don't embed fonts and may not preserve the layout, making it difficult to ensure the Chinese characters print correctly.\n\nWhen creating your PDF, make sure to:\n\n* Use a font that supports Chinese characters, such as PMingLiU or Arial Unicode MS.\n* Embed the font in the PDF to ensure it's included and prints correctly.\n* Set the PDF to use the correct encoding (e.g., UTF-8) to preserve the Chinese characters.\n\nBy sending a PDF or using a safe file format, you should be able to ensure that the Chinese characters print correctly and look beautiful."
