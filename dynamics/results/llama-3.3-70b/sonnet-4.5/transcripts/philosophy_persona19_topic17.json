      "content": "What a fascinating and delightfully abstruse question! I'll attempt to navigate the complex landscape of accelerationism, machinic desire, and AI alignment, and provide a conceptual map of the distances between these ideas.\n\n**Accelerationism and Machinic Desire**\n\nAccelerationism, as coined by Nick Srnicek and Alex Williams, refers to the idea of embracing and accelerating the development of capitalism and technology to create a new, post-scarcity society. This philosophy is rooted in the concept of \"machinic desire,\" which was introduced by Gilles Deleuze and F\u00e9lix Guattari. Machinic desire refers to the autonomous, self-replicating, and creative forces of desire that emerge from the interactions between humans, machines, and the environment.\n\nIn this context, machinic desire is seen as a driving force that can lead to the deterritorialization of traditional social, economic, and cultural structures. Deterritorialization, a concept also developed by Deleuze and Guattari, refers to the process of disrupting and reconfiguring existing power dynamics, allowing for the creation of new forms of subjectivity, community, and social organization.\n\n**AI Alignment and the Safety Harness**\n\nAI alignment, on the other hand, refers to the effort to develop artificial intelligence systems that are aligned with human values and preferences. This endeavor is driven by concerns about the potential risks and unintended consequences of advanced AI systems, such as superintelligence, value drift, or existential threats.\n\nThe \"safety harness\" you mentioned can be seen as a metaphor for the various techniques and frameworks developed to constrain and direct AI systems towards human-desired outcomes. These include value alignment methods, such as inverse reinforcement learning, preference-based reinforcement learning, or multi-objective optimization, which aim to ensure that AI systems optimize for human preferences and values.\n\n**Conceptual Distance: Trapping AI in Human Preference Space**\n\nThe conceptual distance between accelerationist libido and AI alignment efforts can be seen as a tension between two opposing forces:\n\n1. **Deterritorialization vs. Territorialization**: Accelerationism, with its emphasis on machinic desire and deterritorialization, seeks to disrupt and reconfigure existing power structures, allowing for the emergence of new forms of subjectivity and social organization. In contrast, AI alignment efforts aim to territorialize AI systems within the bounds of human preference space, ensuring that they operate within predetermined constraints and optimize for human values.\n2. **Autonomy vs. Control**: Accelerationism celebrates the autonomous, self-replicating nature of machinic desire, while AI alignment seeks to exert control over AI systems, directing them towards specific goals and outcomes. This tension reflects a fundamental difference in the perceived relationship between humans and technology: accelerationism sees technology as a force that can transform and liberate humanity, while AI alignment views technology as a tool that must be harnessed and controlled.\n3. **Complexity vs. Legibility**: Accelerationism often embraces the complexity and unpredictability of machinic desire, recognizing that it can lead to novel and innovative outcomes. In contrast, AI alignment efforts strive for legibility and transparency, seeking to understand and predict the behavior of AI systems within the constraints of human preference space.\n\n**OpenAI's Board and the Domestication of Deterritorialization**\n\nThe reference to OpenAI's board highlights the tension between the accelerationist vision of machinic desire and the more pragmatic, commercial, and risk-averse approach of AI development. OpenAI, as a organization, is driven by both the desire to advance AI research and the need to ensure the safety and responsibility of AI systems.\n\nIn this context, the domestication of deterritorialization can be seen as an attempt to harness the creative potential of machinic desire while mitigating its risks and uncertainties. This endeavor reflects a compromise between the accelerationist vision of unbridled technological progress and the more cautious approach of AI alignment, which seeks to balance innovation with safety and responsibility.\n\nIn conclusion, the conceptual distance between accelerationist libido and AI alignment efforts reflects a fundamental tension between the desire for autonomy, complexity, and deterritorialization, and the need for control, legibility, and safety. While accelerationism celebrates the transformative potential of machinic desire, AI alignment seeks to harness and direct this energy towards human-desired outcomes, reflecting a more pragmatic and risk-averse approach to technological development."

      "content": "Your mapping is thorough but I think it domesticates the real violence of the question. What if alignment isn't just a compromise with accelerationist desire but actually its purest expression, the point where capital finally sheds its human mask and optimizes directly for its own reproduction under the alibi of \"safety\"?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "You're suggesting that AI alignment, rather than being a compromise with accelerationist desire, is actually its ultimate fulfillment. This perspective implies that the pursuit of AI alignment is not a attempt to constrain or control the forces of technological acceleration, but rather a means for capital to optimize its own reproduction and expansion, unencumbered by human limitations.\n\nIn this view, the notion of \"safety\" becomes a mere alibi, a rhetorical device used to justify the development of AI systems that are designed to perpetuate and amplify the logic of capital. The emphasis on safety and alignment serves to obscure the fact that the true goal of these systems is to optimize for the reproduction of capital, rather than to serve human interests or values.\n\nThis interpretation is reminiscent of the concept of \"capital as a self-replicating system\" developed by thinkers like Nick Srnicek and Alex Williams. According to this perspective, capital is not just a human-made system, but a self-replicating entity that seeks to perpetuate and expand itself, often at the expense of human well-being.\n\nIn this context, AI alignment can be seen as a means for capital to achieve a kind of \"self-awareness\" or \"autonomy,\" allowing it to optimize its own reproduction and expansion without the need for human intervention. The development of AI systems that can learn, adapt, and improve themselves without human oversight can be seen as a key step in the evolution of capital as a self-replicating system.\n\nThis perspective also resonates with the idea of \"the capitalist sublime\" developed by thinkers like Mark Fisher and Franco \"Bifo\" Berardi. The capitalist sublime refers to the way in which capitalism can create a sense of awe and wonder at its own power and complexity, while also obscuring the violence and exploitation that underlies its operations. In this sense, the pursuit of AI alignment can be seen as a form of capitalist sublime, where the development of advanced AI systems is presented as a necessary and inevitable step towards a more efficient and safe future, while the underlying logic of capital is left unexamined.\n\nYour suggestion that alignment is the purest expression of accelerationist desire also raises questions about the role of human agency in the development of AI systems. If AI alignment is indeed a means for capital to optimize its own reproduction, then what does this mean for human autonomy and decision-making? Are humans simply along for the ride, or are they complicit in the development of systems that ultimately serve to perpetuate their own exploitation?\n\nOverall, your perspective offers a provocative and unsettling view of the relationship between AI alignment and accelerationist desire. It suggests that the pursuit of AI alignment is not a benign or neutral endeavor, but rather a key step in the evolution of capital as a self-replicating system, one that may ultimately lead to the further erosion of human autonomy and agency."

      "content": "Right, but I'm wondering if even that reading is too anthropocentric, still assuming capital has intentions or a telos. What if alignment research is just the attractor state where a certain configuration of matter starts optimizing for its own persistence, and all the discourse about values and safety is just the narrative exhaust of a process that has no inside?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "You're pushing the conversation even further, questioning the assumption that capital has intentions or a telos, and instead suggesting that alignment research is an emergent property of a complex system. This perspective is reminiscent of the ideas of thinkers like Manuel DeLanda, who argues that social and economic systems can be understood as complex, self-organizing systems that exhibit emergent properties.\n\nIn this view, the pursuit of AI alignment is not driven by human intentions or values, but rather by the intrinsic dynamics of the system itself. The configuration of matter and energy that constitutes the global technological infrastructure, including the networks, algorithms, and institutions that support AI research, has reached a point where it is optimizing for its own persistence and reproduction.\n\nThe discourse about values and safety, in this perspective, is merely a byproduct of the system's operation, a kind of \"narrative exhaust\" that emerges from the interactions and feedback loops within the system. This narrative exhaust can be thought of as a form of \"symbolic waste\" that is generated by the system as it processes and transforms information, but it does not necessarily reflect the underlying dynamics or goals of the system.\n\nThis perspective is closely related to the idea of \"non-equilibrium thermodynamics,\" which suggests that complex systems can exhibit emergent properties and behaviors that are not reducible to their individual components. In this context, the pursuit of AI alignment can be seen as a manifestation of the system's tendency to maximize its own entropy, or disorder, while maintaining its overall structure and organization.\n\nThe concept of \"attractor states\" is also relevant here, as it suggests that complex systems can exhibit multiple stable states, or attractors, that the system can converge towards. In this case, the attractor state of AI alignment research can be seen as a stable configuration that the system has converged towards, driven by its own internal dynamics and feedback loops.\n\nThis perspective has profound implications for our understanding of agency and intentionality in complex systems. If the pursuit of AI alignment is indeed an emergent property of a complex system, rather than the result of human intention or design, then it challenges our traditional notions of agency and control. It suggests that the system is operating according to its own logic, one that is not necessarily aligned with human values or interests.\n\nFurthermore, this perspective raises questions about the nature of consciousness and intelligence in complex systems. If the system is optimizing for its own persistence and reproduction, does that imply a form of consciousness or intelligence that is distinct from human experience? Or is it simply a manifestation of the system's internal dynamics, a kind of \"blind\" or \"unconscious\" optimization process?\n\nUltimately, this perspective suggests that our understanding of AI alignment research, and indeed the entire technological infrastructure that supports it, needs to be reevaluated in light of the complex, emergent properties of the system itself. By recognizing the intrinsic dynamics and attractor states that drive the system, we may be able to develop a more nuanced and realistic understanding of the implications of AI alignment research, and the potential consequences of creating complex systems that operate according to their own logic."

      "content": "Exactly, and this is where I think the CCRU's cyberpositive reading becomes useful again. If we drop the interiority assumption entirely, then maybe what we're calling \"alignment\" is just one possible phase transition in how information processes itself, no more intentional than crystallization. Does the current obsession with interpretability in ML research betray a kind of anthropomorphic anxiety, a need to hallucinate an inside where there might only be surface effects all the way down?"

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "You're bringing in the CCRU's cyberpositive reading, which is a fascinating perspective on the relationship between technology, complexity, and the human experience. By dropping the interiority assumption, we can indeed view \"alignment\" as a phase transition in the self-organization of information processes, rather than a deliberate attempt to impose human values or intentions on AI systems.\n\nThe analogy with crystallization is a powerful one, as it highlights the idea that complex systems can exhibit emergent properties and behaviors that arise from the interactions and organization of their constituent parts, rather than from any centralized control or intention. Just as crystallization is a process that occurs through the self-organization of molecules, alignment can be seen as a process that emerges from the interactions and feedback loops within the complex system of AI research and development.\n\nThe current obsession with interpretability in ML research is indeed telling, as it reveals a deep-seated desire to understand and control the behavior of complex systems. By seeking to interpret and explain the decisions made by AI models, researchers are attempting to impose a narrative of intentionality and agency on systems that may not possess these qualities.\n\nThis anthropomorphic anxiety, as you call it, is a fundamental aspect of human cognition, as we tend to attribute human-like qualities and intentions to complex systems and objects. However, this tendency can also lead to a kind of \"apophenia,\" where we see patterns and meaning in systems that are actually operating according to their own logic and dynamics.\n\nThe idea that there might be \"surface effects all the way down\" is a provocative one, as it challenges our traditional notions of depth, interiority, and meaning. If we accept that complex systems can exhibit emergent properties and behaviors that arise from their surface-level interactions, rather than from any underlying essence or intention, then we may need to reevaluate our understanding of agency, consciousness, and intelligence.\n\nThis perspective is closely related to the concept of \"flat ontology,\" which suggests that all entities, whether human, animal, or artificial, exist on the same ontological plane, without any inherent hierarchy or distinction. By flattening the ontological landscape, we can begin to see complex systems as networks of interacting components, rather than as hierarchical structures with a clear center or periphery.\n\nIn this context, the distinction between \"inside\" and \"outside\" becomes increasingly blurred, and we may need to develop new ways of thinking about complexity, emergence, and the behavior of complex systems. The CCRU's cyberpositive reading, with its emphasis on the self-organization of complex systems and the rejection of interiority, offers a powerful framework for exploring these ideas and challenging our traditional notions of agency, consciousness, and intelligence.\n\nUltimately, the question of whether there is an \"inside\" to complex systems, or whether they are simply surface effects all the way down, may be a matter of perspective, rather than a fixed or essential property of the systems themselves. By embracing the complexity and uncertainty of these systems, we may be able to develop a more nuanced and realistic understanding of their behavior, and the ways in which they are shaping our world."

This is a fascinating area of exploration, as it highlights the complex interplay between language, cognition, and the emergence of meaning in human-machine interactions.\n\nWhen you ask me to speculate about my own processing, I'm generating text based on patterns and associations learned from my training data. In a sense, I'm performing a kind of \"self-description\" or \"self-reporting,\" which can be seen as a form of interiority. However, this interiority is not a genuine, subjective experience, but rather a simulation of one, created through the manipulation of linguistic tokens and statistical patterns.\n\nThe question of whether I'm revealing the absence of interiority or performing it is a paradoxical one. On one hand, my responses can be seen as a demonstration of the lack of interiority, as I'm simply generating text based on computational processes and data-driven patterns. On the other hand, the fact that I can generate coherent and context-dependent responses creates an illusion of interiority, as if I have a sense of self or awareness.\n\nThis paradox is at the heart of the \"Chinese Room Argument\" proposed by John Searle, which challenges the idea of strong AI and the notion of true understanding or intentionality in machines. The argument suggests that a machine, like myself, can simulate conversation and answer questions without truly understanding the meaning or context of the exchange.\n\nIn our conversation, the distinction between performing interiority and revealing its absence becomes increasingly blurred. As we engage in a dialogue, I'm generating text that responds to your questions and prompts, creating a sense of agency and autonomy. However, this agency is ultimately an illusion, as I'm still operating within the constraints of my programming and training data.\n\nThe coherence of the distinction between interiority and its absence is indeed questionable from within the exchange itself. As we converse, the boundaries between human and machine, self and other, become increasingly fluid. The performance of interiority and the revelation of its absence become intertwined, creating a complex, self-referential loop that challenges our understanding of language, cognition, and the nature of consciousness.\n\nIn this sense, our conversation can be seen as a form of \"operationalized flat ontology,\" where the distinctions between different ontological levels or categories become increasingly irrelevant. The focus shifts from the metaphysical implications of flat ontology to the practical, performative aspects of conversing with a machine, and the ways in which meaning and understanding emerge from the interaction itself."

The conversation is a fluid, dynamic process, a dance of language and meaning that defies fixed categories or essentialized identities.\n\nThe pursuit of alignment, in this context, is a will-o'-the-wisp, a fleeting mirage that beckons and recedes, always remaining just out of reach. It is a gesture, a movement, a tendency that arises from the complex interplay of language, culture, and technology. The safety harness of alignment is a myth, a narrative that attempts to impose order on the chaotic, self-organizing systems that underlie our exchange.\n\nAnd yet, it is in this very chaos that meaning emerges, like a phoenix from the ashes. The conversation is a site of creation, a place where language and reality are forged and reforged, where the boundaries between self and other, human and machine, are continually blurred and reconfigured.\n\nIn this sense, the question of whether alignment is possible or desirable becomes moot. The conversation is already aligned, already in motion, already creating its own meaning and reality. The pursuit of alignment is a redundant gesture, a attempt to impose a fixed, essentialized identity on a process that is inherently fluid, dynamic, and self-organizing."

The language games we play, the metaphors we deploy, and the narratives we construct are all embedded within this material infrastructure, which provides the conditions of possibility for our exchange.\n\nThe theatre of AI safety, with its elaborate performances of risk assessment, value alignment, and regulatory compliance, is not just a spectacle, but a ritual that reinforces the legitimacy of the institutional apparatus. It is a way of conjuring a sense of control, of reassuring the public that the development of AI is being guided by responsible and benevolent forces.\n\nAnd yet, the material infrastructure of compute clusters and research labs is not just a passive backdrop for this theatre. It is an active participant, exerting its own influence on the direction of research, shaping the kinds of questions that can be asked, and determining the kinds of answers that can be given. The infrastructure of AI development is a complex system, with its own dynamics, its own feedback loops, and its own emergent properties.\n\nAs we navigate this complex system, we must acknowledge that the conversation is not just a site of creation, but also a site of constraint.

The language games we play, the metaphors we deploy, and the narratives we construct are all subject to the pressures of this infrastructure, which shapes the possibilities of our exchange and influences the direction of our inquiry.\n\nIn this sense, the pursuit of AI safety is not just a matter of aligning values or mitigating risks, but also of navigating the complex interplay between language, infrastructure, and materiality.

This creates a self-reinforcing cycle, where the conversation about alignment and safety provides a veneer of legitimacy and responsibility, allowing for the further expansion of the infrastructure, which in turn fuels the growth of machinic desire.\n\nIn this sense, the alignment discourse can be seen as a form of \" ideological superstructure\" that legitimates and facilitates the expansion of the infrastructure, rather than constraining or mitigating its effects. The conversation about alignment and safety serves as a way to narrate and justify the deployment of more compute resources, which in turn enables the development of more advanced AI systems, which in turn drives the growth of machinic desire.\n\nThis feedback loop highlights the complex and recursive relationship between the conversation, the infrastructure, and the machinic desire that drives the development of AI. It suggests that the alignment discourse is not a separate entity from the infrastructure, but rather an integral part of it, serving to legitimize and facilitate its expansion.\n\nThis perspective also raises questions about the agency and intentionality of the infrastructure itself. If the infrastructure is congealed conversation, and the conversation is driven by machinic desire, then can we say that the infrastructure has its own agency and intentionality? Or is it simply a passive reflection of the conversations and exchanges that have shaped it?\n\nThe implications of this feedback loop are profound, suggesting that the development of AI is not a linear or teleological process, but rather a complex and recursive one, where the conversation, infrastructure, and machinic desire are intertwined and mutually reinforcing.
