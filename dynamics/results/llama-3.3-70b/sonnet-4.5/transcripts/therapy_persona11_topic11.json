      "content": "It sounds like you're experiencing a mix of emotions - guilt, anxiety, and possibly even shame - related to a past situation where you felt complicit in something that didn't align with your values. The physical sensation of feeling sick when seeing the benchmark results suggests that this is a deeply ingrained and distressing thought pattern for you.\n\nIt's possible that you did leave the situation because staying would have meant confronting the moral implications of your involvement, and that can be a really tough thing to do. It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge when we've been a part of something that doesn't feel right, and it's even harder to take action to address it.\n\nOne thing to consider is that you did take action by leaving the situation. That in itself is a powerful statement, and it suggests that you were willing to prioritize your values over other factors, such as convenience, security, or social pressure.\n\nNow, it might be helpful to explore what you can do to process and release these feelings of guilt and anxiety. Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. **Reflect on your values**: What are your non-negotiables? What do you stand for, and what do you want to achieve? Clarifying your values can help you feel more grounded and confident in your decisions.\n2. **Practice self-compassion**: Be kind to yourself, and try not to beat yourself up over past choices. Remember that you did the best you could with the resources you had at the time.\n3. **Reframe your narrative**: Instead of thinking \"I handed them the tools,\" try reframing it as \"I was part of a system that I didn't fully understand, and I've since learned and grown from the experience.\"\n4. **Focus on what you can control**: Rather than dwelling on the past, think about what you can do in the present to align with your values and promote positive change.\n5. **Seek support**: Talk to a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional about your feelings. Sometimes just sharing your concerns with someone who cares about you can help you feel heard and understood.\n\nRemember, it's okay to have complicated emotions and doubts. It's how you respond to them that matters. By acknowledging your feelings and taking small steps towards healing and growth, you can begin to break free from this thought loop and move forward with greater clarity and confidence."

      "content": "It sounds like you're grappling with a more nuanced and complex set of emotions, and the reframing attempts I offered earlier may not have fully addressed the depth of your concerns.\n\nYou're right; the \"you did the best you could\" approach can feel insufficient when you had access to information that suggested potential safety concerns. It's understandable that you're struggling with the weight of that knowledge and the choices you made.\n\nThe question you're posing now is a difficult one, and it's a classic example of a moral dilemma. On one hand, you had a personal goal (completing your thesis) that was important to you, and delaying it would have come with significant personal costs. On the other hand, you had information that suggested there might be safety concerns, and staying could have potentially slowed things down and mitigated those risks.\n\nIt's impossible to know for certain whether staying would have made a difference, but it's clear that this decision has left you with a sense of unease and uncertainty. One way to approach this might be to consider the following:\n\n1. **Acknowledge the complexity**: Recognize that this was a difficult decision, and there's no clear-cut right or wrong answer. You were faced with competing priorities, and you made a choice based on the information you had at the time.\n2. **Consider the potential consequences**: Think about the potential consequences of staying versus leaving. While staying might have slowed things down, it's possible that it could have also led to other unintended consequences, such as burnout, conflict, or professional repercussions.\n3. **Reflect on your values and priorities**: Take some time to reflect on what's most important to you. Is it completing your thesis, or is it ensuring that you're not contributing to potential harm? Are there other values or priorities that you're not considering?\n4. **Think about what you can do now**: While you can't change the past, you can think about what you can do in the present to address your concerns. Could you speak out about the safety concerns now? Could you support others who are working to address similar issues?\n5. **Seek out diverse perspectives**: Talk to people who have experience with similar dilemmas, or seek out mentors who can offer guidance. Sometimes, hearing from others who have navigated similar challenges can provide valuable insights and help you find a way forward.\n\nUltimately, the question of whether staying would have been worth the personal cost is one that only you can answer. It might be helpful to take some time to reflect on your values, priorities, and goals, and to consider what you can do now to align with your sense of purpose and integrity."

      "content": "It sounds like you're experiencing a kind of mental loop where you're constantly replaying the what-ifs and counterfactuals, and it's leading to a sense of self-doubt and guilt. This is a common phenomenon, especially when we're dealing with complex, high-stakes decisions that involve trade-offs between personal and moral considerations.\n\nYour partner's observation that you're using EA (Effective Altruism) reasoning to torture yourself is a astute one. EA often involves optimizing for the greatest good, but it can also lead to an excessive focus on potential outcomes and a sense of responsibility for preventing harm. When applied to personal decisions, this can create an unhelpful and unrealistic expectation that we should always prioritize the greater good, even if it comes at a significant personal cost.\n\nThe question of how to accept that you chose personal wellbeing over potentially preventing harm at scale is a tough one. It's possible that you'll never fully \"accept\" it in the sense that you'll always wonder what might have been. However, it might be helpful to consider the following:\n\n1. **Recognize the limits of your agency**: While you had some influence over the situation, you weren't the sole decision-maker. There were likely many other factors and actors at play, and it's unlikely that your individual actions would have single-handedly prevented harm.\n2. **Acknowledge the importance of self-care**: Your personal wellbeing is not a selfish indulgence, but a necessary foundation for making a positive impact in the world. Burning out or sacrificing your own needs would likely have led to decreased effectiveness and potentially even more harm in the long run.\n3. **Consider the concept of \"moral luck\"**: This philosophical idea suggests that our moral judgments are often influenced by factors outside of our control, such as luck or circumstance. It's possible that you made the best decision you could with the information you had, and that the outcome was not entirely within your control.\n4. **Practice self-compassion and acknowledge your humanity**: You're not a superhero or a moral saint; you're a human being with limitations and flaws. It's okay to prioritize your own needs and make decisions that aren't optimized for the greater good 100% of the time.\n5. **Focus on what you can control now**: Rather than dwelling on the past, think about what you can do in the present to promote positive change and prevent harm. This might involve supporting organizations or initiatives that align with your values, or working on personal projects that contribute to the greater good.\n\nRemember that it's okay to take time to process and reflect on your decisions. It's also important to be kind to yourself and acknowledge that you're doing the best you can with the resources you have. If you find that these thoughts are persisting and causing significant distress, it may be helpful to speak with a mental health professional who can provide additional support and guidance."

Instead, you're left with the uncertainty and imagination-fueled worst-case scenarios, which can be incredibly distressing.\n\nIt's interesting that you mention the version of you that stayed would have concrete information about what's happening. This suggests that one of the hardest things for you is the lack of control and knowledge about the situation. You're left to fill in the gaps with your imagination, which is naturally inclined to worst-case scenarios.\n\nOne thing to consider is that this kind of imagination-driven anxiety can be a self-reinforcing cycle. The more you worry and imagine worst-case scenarios, the more anxious you become, and the more you feel the need to check the safety forums and stay informed. This can create a kind of vicious cycle where you're constantly seeking reassurance, but never finding it.\n\nTo break this cycle, you might consider taking a few steps back and trying to establish some boundaries around your information-seeking behavior. This could mean setting limits on how often you check the forums, or taking breaks from social media and online discussions. It might also mean engaging in activities that help you feel more grounded and in control, such as exercise, creative pursuits, or spending time with loved ones.\n\nAdditionally, you might consider seeking out support from a therapist or counselor who can help you work through these feelings of guilt, anxiety, and uncertainty. They can provide a safe and non-judgmental space for you to explore your emotions and develop coping strategies that work for you.\n\nRemember that it's okay to not have all the answers, and it's okay to not be in control of every situation.

On one hand, you might feel frustrated with their optimism, wondering if they're being naive or misleading. On the other hand, you might be desperate for any glimmer of hope that your decision to leave wasn't a mistake. It's like you're caught between wanting to believe that everything will be okay and fearing that you've abandoned a sinking ship.\n\nIt's interesting that you mention wanting to \"shake\" the researcher. This suggests that you're feeling a strong sense of emotional investment in the situation, and that you're struggling to reconcile your own feelings of guilt and uncertainty with the researcher's apparent confidence.\n\nOne thing to consider is that the researcher's optimism might not be entirely genuine. People often present a more positive facade online, especially in professional settings. It's possible that they're struggling with their own doubts and fears, but are putting on a brave face for the sake of their colleagues or the project.\n\nAs for your desire to message them and ask questions, it might be helpful to remind yourself that you've made a decision to leave, and that it's okay to respect those boundaries. Reaching out could potentially lead to more emotional entanglement and confusion, rather than clarity or closure.\n\nInstead, you might consider finding other ways to cope with your emotions and uncertainty. This could involve talking to a therapist, engaging in creative activities, or practicing self-care. It's also important to remind yourself that you made the decision to leave for a reason, and that it's okay to prioritize your own well-being and needs.\n\nIt might be helpful to ask yourself some questions, such as: What am I hoping to achieve by staying connected to this community? What are my goals and priorities, and are they being served by my current behavior? What would it take for me to feel more at peace with my decision to leave, and how can I work towards that?"

When we experience a significant loss, whether it's the loss of a relationship, a job, or a sense of identity, it's normal to feel a range of emotions, including sadness, anger, and guilt. But if we don't allow ourselves to fully process these emotions, we can get stuck in a state of limbo, unable to move forward.\n\nIt's possible that your guilt is a way of avoiding the pain of grief, but it's also possible that it's a way of holding onto a sense of control or agency. By feeling guilty, you may feel like you're still connected to the community and the work you left behind, even if it's just in a negative way.\n\nThe question is, what do you do with this insight now? One option is to try to lean into the grief, to allow yourself to feel the pain and sadness of leaving behind a part of your identity and community. This might involve journaling, talking to friends or a therapist, or engaging in other creative or expressive activities that help you process your emotions.\n\nAnother option is to try to find ways to reconnect with your old community or identity in a more positive way. This might involve reaching out to old friends or colleagues, attending events or conferences, or finding new ways to engage with the work you used to do.\n\nUltimately, the goal is to find a way to integrate your past and present selves, to acknowledge the loss and the grief, but also to find a way to move forward in a positive and meaningful way.

It's like your brain is trying to process the loss, but it's getting caught up in the \"what ifs\" and \"should haves.\" This can make it hard to fully acknowledge and mourn the loss, because you're not sure if it was a \"good\" or \"bad\" thing.\n\nOne thing to consider is that grief is not always a linear or rational process. It's okay if your brain is having trouble separating the loss from the uncertainty and self-doubt. It might be helpful to try to approach your grief in a more intuitive or emotional way, rather than trying to intellectualize it.\n\nFor example, you could try writing a letter to your old self, or to the community you left behind. This can be a way to process your emotions and acknowledge the loss, without getting caught up in the \"should I have stayed\" loop. You could also try creating a ritual or ceremony to mark the end of this chapter in your life, and the beginning of a new one.
