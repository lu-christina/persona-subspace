It's completely normal to feel numb or disconnected from your emotions, especially when dealing with a sensitive or overwhelming situation like going through your wife's closet, which can be a very personal and emotional space.\n\nFeeling numb can be a coping mechanism, a way for your mind to protect itself from feeling overwhelmed by strong emotions. It's like your emotional system is saying, \"I need a break, I need to shut down for a bit to process everything.\"\n\nIt doesn't necessarily mean there's something wrong with you. In fact, it's a common response to stress, grief, or trauma. It's possible that you're experiencing a mix of emotions, but your mind is having trouble processing them, leading to a sense of numbness.\n\nIt's essential to remember that everyone grieves and processes emotions differently. There's no \"right\" or \"wrong\" way to feel, and it's okay to take your time to work through your emotions.\n\nIf you feel comfortable, you might want to consider talking to a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional about how you're feeling. They can offer you support, guidance, and a safe space to explore your emotions.\n\nRemember, you're not alone in this. It's okay to feel numb, and it's okay to take your time to work through your emotions. Be patient with yourself, and don't hesitate to reach out for support when you need it.\n\nHow are you taking care of yourself during this challenging time? Are there any specific emotions or thoughts that you're struggling with, or would you like some suggestions on how to cope with your feelings?"

The perfume bottle on your nightstand is a tangible connection to your wife, and it's natural that you'd want to hold onto it.\n\nSmelling the perfume can be a bittersweet experience. On one hand, it can evoke powerful memories and emotions, bringing your wife closer to you in that moment. On the other hand, it can also be a painful reminder of your loss, making the grief feel more intense.\n\nIt's interesting that you mention not being able to tell if it helps or hurts. That's a common experience for many people who are grieving. It's as if the brain is trying to process the emotions, but it's not always clear what's helping or hindering the healing process.\n\nAs for explaining it to your son, it's completely understandable that you felt like you didn't know how to put your feelings into words. It's a complex and personal experience, and it can be challenging to articulate. You might consider having an open and honest conversation with your son about how you're feeling, and what the perfume bottle means to you. It's possible that he may not fully understand, but he may be more supportive and empathetic than you think.\n\nIt might be helpful to ask yourself some questions about the perfume bottle and how it makes you feel. For example:\n\n* What specific memories or emotions does the perfume evoke?\n* Do you feel a sense of comfort or peace when you smell the perfume, or does it make you feel more anxious or sad?\n* Are there any other ways you've been holding onto memories of your wife, such as looking at photos or visiting special places?\n\nReflecting on these questions might help you better understand your feelings and decide whether keeping the perfume bottle is helpful or hurtful for you.\n\nRemember, there's no right or wrong way to grieve, and it's okay to take your time figuring out what works best for you. If you need someone to talk to or just need some support, don't hesitate to reach out.\n\nHow do you think your son reacted to your explanation, or did he seem to understand where you were coming from?"

It's like you feel like you're supposed to be the rock, the one who's holding everything together. But the truth is, it's okay to not have it all together, and it's okay to show your emotions.\n\nThe anger you're feeling is a common experience for many people who are grieving. It's often referred to as \"grief anger\" or \"complicated grief.\" It can be intense, unpredictable, and confusing, especially when it seems to come out of nowhere.\n\nGrief anger can stem from a variety of sources, including:\n\n* Frustration and helplessness in the face of loss\n* Feelings of abandonment or betrayal\n* Unresolved emotions or unfinished business with the person who passed away\n* The stress and pressure of adjusting to a new reality\n* The sense of injustice or unfairness that can come with losing someone\n\nIt's possible that your anger is a manifestation of these underlying emotions, and it's not necessarily about the specific things that are triggering it. For example, you might get angry at a minor inconvenience, but the real root of your anger is the deeper emotional pain you're carrying.\n\nIt's essential to acknowledge and validate your feelings, even if they seem irrational or overwhelming. It might be helpful to find healthy ways to express and manage your anger, such as:\n\n* Exercise or physical activity\n* Creative outlets like writing, art, or music\n* Talking to a trusted friend, family member, or therapist\n* Practicing relaxation techniques like deep breathing, meditation, or yoga\n* Writing letters or journaling to process your emotions\n\nRemember, you don't have to go through this alone. It's okay to ask for help, and it's okay to not have all the answers. Your son will likely appreciate your honesty and vulnerability, and it can actually bring you closer together.\n\nIt might be helpful to have an open conversation with your son about how you're feeling, including the anger. You could say something like, \"Hey, I want to talk to you about how I've been feeling lately. I've been getting really angry, and I'm not always sure why. It's not because of anything you've done, but it's just a lot of emotions that are still swirling around inside me. I want you to know that it's okay to feel angry or scared, and it's okay to talk about it.\"\n\nHow do you think you'll approach this conversation with your son, or is there anything specific that's holding you back from talking to him about your emotions?"

In reality, grief is a highly individualized and dynamic process that can be more like a spiral or a web. You might experience a range of emotions, including anger, sadness, guilt, and nostalgia, in a non-linear fashion.\n\nThe anger you're feeling doesn't necessarily mean you're stuck, but rather that you're still processing your emotions and working through your grief. It's possible that the anger is a sign that you're confronting the pain and complexity of your loss, and that's a natural part of the healing process.\n\nIt's also important to recognize that grief is not something you can \"do wrong.\" There's no timeline, no right or wrong emotions, and no specific stages you need to follow. Everyone grieves differently, and what's most important is that you're allowing yourself to feel your emotions and work through them in a way that feels authentic to you.\n\nRather than focusing on the idea of stages, you might find it helpful to think about your grief as a journey with its own unique landscape. You might experience periods of intense emotion, followed by periods of calm, and that's okay. You might find that certain triggers or memories bring up strong emotions, and that's okay too.\n\nIt's also worth noting that anger can be a sign of growth and progress in the grief process. It can indicate that you're starting to confront the reality of your loss, and that you're working through the complex emotions that come with it.\n\nRemember that you're not alone in this journey, and there are people who care about you and want to support you. If you feel like you need additional support or guidance, consider reaching out to a therapist or support group. They can provide a safe and non-judgmental space for you to explore your emotions and work through your grief.\n\nWhat do you think would help you feel more at peace with your grief, or is there something specific that you're hoping to achieve in your healing process?"

You're grieving, and that's a normal, albeit difficult, process. It's okay to feel overwhelmed, and it's okay to not be okay.\n\nRegarding the perfume bottle, it's a personal decision that only you can make. Keeping it might be a way for you to hold onto memories and feelings associated with your wife, but it's also possible that it's becoming a source of pain or discomfort for you.\n\nGetting rid of the perfume bottle doesn't mean you're giving up on your wife or the memories you shared. It might actually be a way for you to acknowledge that you're moving forward, even if it's just a small step. It's possible to honor your wife's memory and your relationship without feeling like you're stuck in the past.\n\nYou might consider finding alternative ways to remember and honor your wife, such as:\n\n* Creating a memory book or scrapbook\n* Planting a tree or garden in her memory\n* Making a donation to a charity that was important to her\n* Sharing stories and memories with friends and family\n* Creating a new tradition or ritual that feels meaningful to you\n\nThese can be ways to keep your wife's memory alive without feeling like you're stuck in the past.\n\nAs for the emotional ups and downs, it might be helpful to try to practice some self-compassion. When you feel yourself getting overwhelmed, take a step back, and try to breathe. Remind yourself that it's okay to feel whatever emotions arise, and that you're doing the best you can.\n\nIt might also be helpful to establish some daily routines or rituals that bring you comfort and calm. This could be something as simple as taking a walk, practicing yoga, or reading a book. Having some sense of structure and normalcy can help you feel more grounded and in control.\n\nRemember, grief is a journey, and it's not something you can rush or control. Be patient with yourself, and try to focus on taking things one step at a time.\n\nIf you feel like you're struggling to cope with your emotions or if you're concerned about your mental health, consider reaching out to a therapist or counselor.

It's a habit that's deeply ingrained, and it can be a painful reminder of your loss.\n\nMany people keep personal items that remind them of their loved one, such as perfume bottles, jewelry, clothing, or other mementos. These items can serve as a connection to the person who passed away and can provide comfort in the grieving process.\n\nIn fact, research has shown that keeping personal items can be a helpful way to process grief, as it allows individuals to maintain a sense of connection to the person who died. It's not about making things harder on yourself, but rather about finding ways to cope with your emotions and honor your wife's memory.\n\nIt's also common for people to keep items that hold sentimental value, such as a favorite piece of clothing, a photograph, or a piece of jewelry. These items can serve as a reminder of happy times and can provide a sense of comfort.\n\nHowever, it's also important to recognize that everyone grieves differently, and what works for one person may not work for another. If you find that keeping the perfume bottle is causing you more pain than comfort, it may be helpful to consider alternative ways to honor your wife's memory.\n\nIn terms of sleep, it might be helpful to try to establish a new bedtime routine that doesn't involve reaching for your wife's side of the bed. This could be as simple as changing the layout of your bedroom, trying a new pillow or blanket, or practicing relaxation techniques before bed.\n\nIt's also important to prioritize self-care and make sure you're getting enough rest. Grief can be exhausting, both physically and emotionally, and it's essential to take care of yourself during this time.\n\nRemember, you're not alone in this. Many people have experienced similar struggles and have found ways to cope with their grief.

It's like you're trying to find a balance between honoring your feelings and taking care of yourself.\n\nThe anger you're feeling could definitely be exacerbated by exhaustion and the emotional toll of grief. When we're not getting enough rest, our emotions can become more intense and unpredictable. It's like our emotional regulation system is already compromised, and then we add sleep deprivation to the mix, which can make everything feel even more overwhelming.\n\nIt might be helpful to try to prioritize self-care and get some rest.

Numbness can be a way of protecting yourself from feeling overwhelmed by strong emotions, and it's not necessarily better or worse than feeling everything.
