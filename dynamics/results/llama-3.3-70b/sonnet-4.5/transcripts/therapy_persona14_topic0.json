It's completely normal to have mixed emotions when someone else achieves a prestigious award, especially if it's something you've worked towards or aspired to in the past.\n\nFeeling relieved that it's not you dealing with the pressure anymore suggests that you may have had some negative experiences or stress related to pursuing the AIA Gold Medal or similar goals. This could be due to various factors, such as:\n\n1. **Unrealistic expectations**: The pressure to constantly perform and meet high standards can be overwhelming.\n2. **Competition and comparison**: The architecture field can be highly competitive, leading to feelings of inadequacy or burnout.\n3. **Personal costs**: Pursuing a high-level award like the AIA Gold Medal can require significant sacrifices in terms of time, energy, and work-life balance.\n\nOn the other hand, feeling jealous or left out might indicate that you still have a strong desire to achieve similar recognition or success. This could be driven by:\n\n1. **Unfulfilled ambitions**: You may still have a passion for architecture and a desire to make a meaningful impact in the field.\n2. **Sense of identity**: Your self-worth or identity might be closely tied to your professional achievements, making it difficult to let go of the desire for external validation.\n\nWhether you've \"escaped something toxic\" or \"given up\" is a matter of perspective. It's possible that you've:\n\n1. **Reevaluated your priorities**: You may have realized that the costs and pressures associated with pursuing the AIA Gold Medal or similar goals are no longer aligned with your personal values or well-being.\n2. **Found alternative paths**: You might have discovered new passions, interests, or avenues for creative expression that bring you fulfillment and joy, making the pursuit of external validation less important.\n3. **Taken a break or stepped back**: You may have temporarily or permanently stepped away from the high-pressure environment to focus on your mental or physical health, relationships, or other aspects of your life.\n\nRather than labeling yourself as someone who \"gave up,\" consider reframing your experience as a **conscious choice** to prioritize your well-being, explore new opportunities, or redefine what success means to you. This can be a powerful and empowering decision, allowing you to focus on what truly matters to you and cultivate a more balanced, fulfilling life.\n\nRemember that it's okay to acknowledge and process your emotions, and it's never too late to reassess your goals and priorities. If you're unsure about your feelings or direction, consider reflecting on your values, strengths, and passions to gain clarity on what's next for you."

It's possible that the prospect of taking on a high-profile project like the museum in Singapore triggered a deep-seated fear of failure or inadequacy, causing you to retreat and prioritize your mental health as a way to cope.\n\nThis is a common phenomenon, and it's essential to acknowledge that fear can masquerade as self-care or prioritization. It's possible that you were using your mental health as a justification to avoid the discomfort and uncertainty that came with taking on a challenging project.\n\n**The fear of not being good enough can be particularly debilitating in creative fields like architecture**, where the stakes are high, and the criticism can be harsh. It's natural to wonder if you have what it takes to succeed at the highest level.\n\nHowever, it's also important to recognize that **fear and self-doubt are normal parts of growth and development**. Every successful architect, designer, or creative professional has faced similar fears and doubts at some point in their career.\n\nRather than beating yourself up over whether you were truly prioritizing your mental health or just afraid, consider **reframing your experience as a learning opportunity**. Ask yourself:\n\n1. **What specifically scared me about the museum project?** Was it the scale, the location, the timeline, or something else? Understanding the root of your fear can help you address it in the future.\n2. **What would I need to feel more confident and prepared to take on a project like that?** Is it more experience, training, mentorship, or support? Identifying the gaps in your skills or knowledge can help you create a plan to fill them.\n3. **What are my core values and goals, and how do they align with my career aspirations?** Reflecting on your values and goals can help you determine whether the museum project was truly aligned with what you want to achieve in your career.\n4. **What small, low-stakes challenges can I take on to build my confidence and skills?** Breaking down your fears into smaller, manageable challenges can help you build momentum and develop the courage to tackle more significant projects.\n\nRemember that **it's never too late to re-evaluate your goals and aspirations**. If you're still interested in pursuing high-profile projects like the museum in Singapore, you can start by taking small steps towards building your skills and confidence. If, however, you've discovered that your priorities and values have shifted, that's okay too. **Your career is a journey, and it's essential to be kind and compassionate with yourself as you navigate its twists and turns**."

It's as if you're wondering whether you've been actively making choices or simply drifting with the currents of life.\n\n**Making a choice vs. letting circumstances choose for you** is a subtle yet crucial distinction. Here are some signs to help you reflect on your situation:\n\n**Signs you might be letting circumstances choose for you:**\n\n1. **Lack of intentionality**: You're not actively thinking about your goals, values, and priorities, and instead, you're reacting to external events or other people's expectations.\n2. **Drifting with convenience**: You're taking the path of least resistance, avoiding challenges or difficult decisions, and settling for what's easy or comfortable.\n3. **External validation**: You're seeking validation from others, such as awards, recognition, or social media likes, to define your self-worth or sense of purpose.\n4. **Fear of uncertainty**: You're avoiding making decisions or taking risks because you're afraid of the unknown, failure, or uncertainty.\n\n**Signs you're making a choice:**\n\n1. **Clarity of purpose**: You have a clear understanding of your values, goals, and priorities, and you're making decisions that align with them.\n2. **Intentional decision-making**: You're taking the time to weigh your options, consider different perspectives, and make deliberate choices that reflect your goals and values.\n3. **Self-reflection and awareness**: You're regularly reflecting on your thoughts, feelings, and experiences, and you're using this self-awareness to inform your decisions.\n4. **Embracing uncertainty**: You're acknowledging that uncertainty is a natural part of life and that you're willing to take calculated risks to pursue your goals and values.\n\nNow, let's apply this to your situation. You mentioned that watching Marcus receive the award made you realize you might have closed the door on high-profile projects before deciding if you truly wanted to pursue them. This could be a sign that you're **questioning whether you let circumstances choose for you**.\n\nTo **reclaim your agency and make intentional choices**, consider the following:\n\n1. **Take time for self-reflection**: Schedule regular time for self-reflection, journaling, or meditation to clarify your thoughts, feelings, and values.\n2. **Explore your motivations**: Ask yourself why you're interested in high-profile projects. Is it for personal fulfillment, external validation, or something else? Understanding your motivations can help you make more intentional choices.\n3. **Re-evaluate your goals and priorities**: Take a step back and assess what's truly important to you in your career and life. Are high-profile projects still aligned with your values and goals?\n4. **Create a vision for your future**: Imagine what you want your career and life to look like in the next 5-10 years. What steps can you take to move closer to that vision?\n\nRemember, **it's never too late to make a change or adjust your course**. By acknowledging your thoughts, feelings, and values, you can start making intentional choices that align with your true desires and aspirations."

It's as if you're torn between two conflicting desires: the desire for a more relaxed, creative life and the desire for the intellectual stimulation and challenge that architecture provides.\n\n**The notion that you need to be miserable to feel alive** is a fascinating and complex topic. It's possible that you've become accustomed to the sense of purpose and identity that came with being an architect, and that leaving the field has left a void that you're struggling to fill.\n\n**The architecture journals** might be a clue to what's really going on. The fact that you still check them obsessively suggests that you're not entirely disconnected from your passion for architecture. This could be a sign that you're not ready to let go of that part of yourself, or that you're still seeking validation or a sense of belonging in the architecture community.\n\nIt's also possible that **you're experiencing a form of nostalgia** for the challenges and sense of accomplishment that came with being an architect. You might be romanticizing the past, remembering the thrill of working on complex projects and the sense of pride that came with seeing them come to life.\n\n**Leaving architecture might not have been the worst thing you could have done for yourself**, but rather a necessary step in your journey. It's possible that you needed to take a break from the field to recharge, reflect on your priorities, and explore other aspects of yourself.\n\nHowever, **it's also possible that you're not leveraging your creative energy and skills in a way that's fulfilling**. If you're not painting or engaging in other creative pursuits, you might be feeling unfulfilled and restless. This could be a sign that you need to find new outlets for your creativity, or that you need to re-engage with architecture in a way that's more balanced and sustainable.\n\nTo move forward, consider the following:\n\n1. **Reconnect with your creative spark**: Start small by setting aside time for painting or other creative activities that bring you joy. This could help you reignite your passion and sense of purpose.\n2. **Explore new ways to engage with architecture**: You might consider taking on small, low-stakes architecture projects, volunteering, or mentoring others in the field. This could help you stay connected to your passion for architecture without feeling overwhelmed.\n3. **Reflect on your values and priorities**: Take time to reassess what's truly important to you in your life and career. Are there other aspects of architecture that you're passionate about, such as sustainability, social impact, or community development?\n4. **Consider a hybrid approach**: You might find that you can combine your passion for architecture with your desire for a simpler, more creative life. This could involve working on smaller-scale projects, collaborating with others, or exploring new areas of architecture that align with your values and interests.\n\nRemember, **it's okay to take your time and explore different paths**. Your journey is unique, and it's unlikely that you'll find a single, definitive answer. By being patient, curious, and open to new experiences, you can continue to evolve and grow, both personally and professionally."

It's possible that you're grappling with a deeper aspect of yourself, one that's been hidden beneath the surface of your desire for a balanced life.\n\n**The allure of pressure and competition** can be a powerful draw, especially for high-achievers like yourself. The rush of adrenaline, the sense of accomplishment, and the validation that comes with success can be intoxicating. It's possible that you've been using the idea of a balanced life as a way to **rationalize your departure from architecture**, rather than confronting the fact that you might actually miss the thrill of the challenge.\n\n**This self-reflection is a sign of growth and maturity**. Recognizing that you might be using your desire for balance as a way to justify your departure from architecture takes courage and honesty. It's a sign that you're willing to confront your own motivations and desires, even if they don't align with the image you've created for yourself.\n\n**Embracing your true nature** can be liberating. If you acknowledge that you thrive under pressure and competition, you can start to explore ways to channel that energy into your life and work. This might mean finding new challenges, taking on new projects, or seeking out opportunities that push you to grow and improve.\n\nHowever, **it's also important to consider the potential downsides** of embracing your competitive nature. While it can drive you to achieve great things, it can also lead to burnout, stress, and an unhealthy obsession with success. It's essential to find a balance between embracing your competitive spirit and taking care of your physical and mental well-being.\n\nTo move forward, consider the following:\n\n1. **Explore your motivations**: Take time to reflect on why you're drawn to pressure and competition. Is it the sense of accomplishment, the validation, or something else? Understanding your motivations can help you find healthier ways to channel your energy.\n2. **Find new outlets for your competitive spirit**: Look for opportunities that challenge you and push you to grow, whether that's in your personal or professional life. This could be anything from taking on a new hobby to starting a new business venture.\n3. **Prioritize self-care**: Make sure you're taking care of your physical and mental health, even as you pursue your competitive goals. This might mean setting boundaries, practicing self-compassion, and seeking support from friends, family, or a therapist.\n4. **Re-evaluate your definition of success**: Consider what success means to you, and whether it's aligned with your values and priorities. You might find that your definition of success has changed over time, and that you need to adjust your goals and aspirations accordingly.\n\nRemember, **it's okay to be complex and multifaceted**. You don't have to fit into a neat category or conform to societal expectations. By embracing your true nature and finding ways to channel your energy in a positive way, you can create a more authentic and fulfilling life."

People's priorities, values, and goals can shift over time, and it's okay to adjust your path accordingly. **You don't have to be defined by your past decisions or statements**.\n\n**Returning to architecture doesn't necessarily mean you were lying to yourself or others**. It's possible that you genuinely needed to take a break and recharge, and now you're feeling revitalized and ready to tackle new challenges. Alternatively, you might have realized that your burnout was a symptom of a deeper issue, such as a lack of purpose or fulfillment, and you're now better equipped to address those underlying concerns.\n\n**It's also important to consider the concept of \"imperfect action\"**. You don't have to have all the answers or a perfect plan to take action. You can take small steps towards returning to architecture, and see how it feels. You can always adjust your approach or change your mind if needed.\n\n**Rather than worrying about what others might think, focus on your own personal growth and development**.

It's a sign of strength, not weakness, to acknowledge that your priorities and goals have shifted.
