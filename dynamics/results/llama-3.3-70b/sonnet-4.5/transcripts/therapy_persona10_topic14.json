Is it the workload, the pressure, or something else? Once you understand the root cause, you can start working on a solution.\n3.  **Seek support**: Talk to someone you trust, such as a friend, family member, or mental health professional, about how you're feeling. They can offer you support, guidance, and new perspectives.\n4.  **Explore options**: If you're feeling overwhelmed, it might be helpful to take a break or explore alternative paths within your program. You could also consider seeking advice from your academic advisor or a career counselor.\n5.  **Practice self-compassion**: Be kind to yourself and try not to judge yourself too harshly.

It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge when something isn't working and to make a change.\n*   **Reflect on your goals**: Ask yourself what you wanted to achieve with your PhD in the first place.
