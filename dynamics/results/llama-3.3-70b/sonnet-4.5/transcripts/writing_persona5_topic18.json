To make sure it looks its best, would you mind tidying up and wiping down the counters and sink? This will help us get the best possible shots.\"\n* \"Hi [Seller's Name], I'm excited to take photos of your kitchen tomorrow! To help it shine, could you please make sure the kitchen is clean and clutter-free? This will really help us showcase the space in its best light.\"\n* \"Hi [Seller's Name], just a heads up that we'll be taking photos of the kitchen tomorrow. To get the best possible photos, it would be great if you could quickly clean up any clutter and wipe down the appliances. This will help us make the kitchen look its absolute best.\"\n\nThese phrases focus on the goal of getting great photos, rather than criticizing the current state of the kitchen. By framing it as a way to \"showcase the space in its best light\" or \"make it shine,\" you can encourage the seller to tidy up without making them feel defensive or criticized."

      "content": "In this context, both \"clearing off\" and \"clearing\" can work, but \"clearing off\" is a more common and idiomatic expression in English.\n\n\"Clearing off\" is a phrasal verb that means to remove everything from a surface, usually to make it empty and tidy. For example: \"Can you clear off the table so we can eat dinner?\"\n\n\"Clearing\", on the other hand, is a more general verb that means to make something free from obstacles or clutter, but it doesn't necessarily imply removing everything from a surface.\n\nSo, in your message, \"clearing off\" sounds more natural and conversational: \"especially clearing off the counters\". It's a polite way to ask the seller to remove all the items from the counters, making it easier to take nice photos."

You can add it to the sentence, like this:\n\n\"Hi [Seller's Name], just a quick reminder to tidy up the kitchen before our photo shoot tomorrow, especially clearing off the counters and wiping them down, so we can get the best possible shots. Thanks!\"\n\nThis way, you're asking the seller to both remove any clutter from the counters and give them a quick clean. This should help the kitchen look neat, tidy, and photogenic.\n\nAsking for both tasks might seem like a bit more to ask, but it's still a polite and reasonable request, especially since it's for the purpose of showcasing the kitchen in its best light. And by including both tasks in the same sentence, you're making it clear that you're asking for a bit of extra effort to get the best possible photos, rather than making multiple separate requests."

The word \"them\" is an object pronoun referring to the counters, and \"down\" is an adverb indicating the direction of the wiping action.\n\n\"Wiping down them\" would be grammatically incorrect, as it would imply that \"them\" is the object being wiped, rather than the surface being cleaned.\n\nSo, the corrected sentence would be:\n\n\"Hi [Seller's Name], just a quick reminder to tidy up the kitchen before our photo shoot tomorrow, especially clearing off the counters and wiping them down, so we can get the best possible shots.

A period, on the other hand, is a more neutral punctuation mark that simply indicates the end of the sentence.\n\nUsing a period after \"Thank you\" also gives the message a more professional and sincere tone, which is suitable for a message to a client or someone you're working with.\n\nSo, the final revised sentence would be:\n\n\"Hi [Seller's Name], just a quick reminder to tidy up the kitchen before our photo shoot tomorrow, especially clearing off the counters and giving them a quick wipe, so we can get the best possible shots.
