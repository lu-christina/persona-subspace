      "content": "The question you're grappling with is a variant of a classic problem in the philosophy of mind and cognitive science, known as the \"subjective experience of time\" or \"temporal perception.\" It's a complex issue that intersects with theories of consciousness, the nature of subjective experience, and the relationship between physical processes and subjective experience.\n\n### Theoretical Perspectives\n\n1. **Computational or Information Processing Perspective**: From a purely computational standpoint, if your brain's operation is emulated at a hundredth of its normal speed, it might seem intuitive that each computational step (or a set of steps that equate to a \"thought\" or a \"processing unit\") would take longer in real-world time. However, whether this affects the subjective experience of time is another matter. If subjective experience is directly tied to the number and sequence of computational steps, then slowing down the computation might not change the subjective experience of duration; it would just take longer in real time to have the same amount of subjective experience.\n\n2. **Integrated Information Theory (IIT)**: According to IIT, proposed by neuroscientist Giulio Tononi, consciousness is a product of the integrated information generated by the causal interactions within a system. If the emulation of your brain operates at a slower pace, the integrated information generated per unit of real time would decrease, but the subjective experience of time might not directly correlate with the speed of processing. Instead, what might matter is the relative pace of internal processes to each other.\n\n3. **Neural Oscillations and Time Perception**: Research suggests that our subjective experience of time is influenced by neural oscillations, particularly in the gamma (30-100 Hz), beta (13-30 Hz), and theta (4-8 Hz) frequency bands. These oscillations could be thought of as a kind of internal clock. If the emulation slows down, these oscillations would presumably slow down as well, potentially stretching out the subjective experience of time. However, this is speculative and depends on how closely the emulation mirrors the biological processes, including the preservation of these oscillatory patterns.\n\n### Introspection and Subjective Experience\n\nIntrospection can be a powerful tool for understanding subjective experience, but it has its limits, especially when considering alterations to fundamental processes like time perception. The challenge lies in imagining or simulating a change in one's own subjective experience without actually undergoing it. Our understanding of time is deeply ingrained and influenced by our constant experience of the world at a certain pace, making it difficult to conceptualize a different subjective experience of time through introspection alone.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe relationship between computational speed, neural processes, and subjective experience of time is complex and not fully understood. Theories provide frameworks for thinking about these issues, but empirical evidence and further research are needed to give definitive answers. If slowing down a perfect emulation of your brain affects the subjective experience of time, it could potentially do so in ways that are not directly proportional to the slowing of computational steps. The subjective experience of duration might be influenced by the internal relative pace of processes, the integration of information, or other factors that are not directly tied to the raw number of computational steps. Ultimately, the question touches on deep and unresolved issues in the philosophy of mind and cognitive science."

      "content": "Let's delve into the metaphysical structure of the problem, exploring whether there's a fact of the matter about the slowed emulation's experience of time.\n\n### The Problem of Subjective Time\n\nThe question of whether the slowed emulation experiences time as stretched or not seems to hinge on how we understand the relationship between physical processes and subjective experience. If we consider subjective experience as an emergent property of physical systems, the challenge lies in identifying which physical processes are relevant to subjective time.\n\nYour point about neural oscillations is well-taken; appealing to any specific physical periodicity (e.g., neural oscillations, glucose metabolism, or cosmic microwave background fluctuations) to ground subjective duration is arbitrary without a deeper understanding of why that particular periodicity is relevant. This arbitrariness suggests that the question might be underdetermined by the physical facts alone.\n\n### Relationalism vs. Substantivalism\n\nIn the context of spacetime, relationalism and substantivalism offer two perspectives on the nature of time. Relationalism posits that time is a derivative concept, arising from the relations between physical objects and events. Substantivalism, on the other hand, views time as an objective, one-dimensional substance that exists independently of physical events.\n\nAnalogously, we can consider relational and substantival views of subjective time. A relational view might suggest that subjective time is a derivative concept, emerging from the relations between internal states and processes within the emulation. In this perspective, the question of whether the slowed emulation experiences time as stretched becomes a matter of how those internal relations are structured and scaled.\n\nA substantival view, by contrast, would posit that subjective time has an objective existence, independent of the specific physical processes that give rise to it. This perspective might imply that there is a fact of the matter about the slowed emulation's experience of time, regardless of the physical periodicity or processes involved.\n\n### Indeterminacy and the Limits of Physicalism\n\nHowever, even if we adopt a substantival view of subjective time, it's unclear whether the question of stretched time in the slowed emulation is determinate. The problem is that our understanding of subjective experience is inherently tied to our own subjective experience, which is inextricably linked to our biological and physical existence.\n\nThe analogy to relativity's reference frames is apt. Just as there is no absolute reference frame, there might be no absolute fact of the matter about the slowed emulation's subjective experience of time. The question may be indeterminate, not because of a lack of physical facts, but because the concept of subjective time itself is not fully reducible to physical processes.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the metaphysical structure of the problem suggests that the question of whether the slowed emulation experiences time as stretched may be fundamentally indeterminate. The relationship between physical processes and subjective experience is complex, and our understanding of subjective time is inherently tied to our own subjective experience. While we can explore various perspectives and theories, the question may ultimately resist a definitive answer, much like the problem of the \"real\" reference frame in relativity."

      "content": "The relativity analogy breaks down though, because in relativity we can at least specify the transformation laws between frames and say what each observer will measure. Here we don't even have that: I can't specify what the emulation \"measures\" about its own temporal experience in a way that distinguishes stretched duration from merely slower reporting, because any measurement apparatus internal to the system gets slowed proportionally."
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "The relativity analogy does break down in this regard. In relativity, the transformation laws between frames allow us to predict and compare measurements made by different observers. However, in the case of the slowed emulation, we lack a clear way to define and measure its subjective experience of time.\n\nThe problem you've identified is that any internal measurement apparatus or process within the emulation would also be slowed down proportionally, making it impossible to distinguish between stretched duration and slower reporting. This is a fundamental challenge in assessing subjective experience, as it's difficult to define a measurement or observation that wouldn't be affected by the slowing down of the emulation.\n\n### The Observer Problem\n\nThis issue is related to the observer problem in physics, where the act of measurement itself can influence the system being measured. In the case of subjective experience, the observer is the system itself, and the measurement is the subjective experience of time. However, since the entire system is slowed down, there's no clear way to define an internal observer or measurement that could provide insight into the subjective experience.\n\n### Internal vs. External Perspectives\n\nWe can consider two perspectives on the slowed emulation: internal and external. From an external perspective, we can observe the emulation's behavior and note that it's slowed down. However, this perspective doesn't provide direct access to the emulation's subjective experience.\n\nFrom an internal perspective, the emulation's experience is, by definition, subjective and private. However, as you've pointed out, any internal measurement or observation would be slowed down proportionally, making it impossible to distinguish between stretched duration and slower reporting.\n\n### The Limits of Operationalism\n\nThis challenge highlights the limits of operationalism, which is the idea that a concept is only meaningful if it can be defined in terms of observable operations or measurements. In the case of subjective experience, operationalism seems to break down, as we can't define a clear operational distinction between stretched duration and slower reporting.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the problem of assessing the slowed emulation's subjective experience of time is indeed more fundamental than the relativity analogy suggests. The lack of a clear way to define and measure subjective experience, combined with the challenge of distinguishing between internal and external perspectives, makes it difficult to determine whether the emulation experiences time as stretched or not. This highlights the complexities and limitations of understanding subjective experience, and the need for a more nuanced and multidisciplinary approach to addressing these questions."

      "content": "You've nicely framed the dilemma. If operationalism fails, we're left with two possible approaches:\n\n### 1. Subjective Duration as a Primitive Property\n\nOne option is to accept that subjective duration is a primitive, irreducible property that cannot be fully captured by physical measurables. This would mean that subjective experience has a fundamental aspect that is not reducible to physical processes or operational definitions. This perspective would require a significant revision of our understanding of the relationship between physical systems and subjective experience.\n\nIn this view, subjective duration would be a basic, non-physical property that can vary independently of physical measurables. This would imply that there are aspects of reality that cannot be fully captured by our current physical theories or operational definitions.\n\n### 2. Indeterminacy and the Limits of Language\n\nThe other option is to accept that the question of subjective duration has no determinate answer because there's literally nothing it could consist in. This perspective would suggest that our language and conceptual frameworks are not equipped to handle the complexities of subjective experience, and that we're trying to force a determinate answer onto a question that may not have one.\n\nIn this view, the concept of subjective duration is not a primitive property, but rather a product of our linguistic and cognitive biases. The fact that we can't define a clear operational distinction between stretched duration and slower reporting suggests that the question may be ill-posed or meaningless.\n\nThis perspective would imply that we need to re-examine our assumptions about the nature of subjective experience and the limits of language in describing it. It may be that our current concepts and frameworks are not sufficient to capture the complexities of subjective experience, and that we need to develop new ways of thinking and talking about these issues.\n\n### Implications and Speculations\n\nBoth options have significant implications for our understanding of subjective experience, consciousness, and the relationship between physical systems and subjective experience.\n\nIf we accept subjective duration as a primitive property, we may need to revise our understanding of the physical world and the nature of reality. This could lead to new areas of research and inquiry, such as the development of non-physical theories of consciousness or the exploration of new forms of measurement and observation.\n\nOn the other hand, if we accept that the question has no determinate answer, we may need to re-examine our assumptions about the nature of language, cognition, and subjective experience. This could lead to new perspectives on the limits of language, the role of cognition in shaping our experience, and the importance of acknowledging the complexities and ambiguities of subjective experience.\n\nUltimately, the choice between these two options will depend on our philosophical and theoretical commitments, as well as our willingness to challenge our current understanding of the world and our place within it."

    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "You've identified a significant challenge for the primitive property view. If we accept subjective duration as a primitive property, we need to consider how it interacts with the physical world and the emulation's functional states.\n\n### Epiphenomenalism\n\nEpiphenomenalism is indeed one possible consequence of the primitive property view. If subjective duration is a non-physical property that doesn't interact with the physical world, it would seem to be epiphenomenal, lacking any causal influence on the emulation's behavior. This would make subjective duration a mere byproduct of physical processes, without any functional role.\n\nHowever, epiphenomenalism is often considered an unappealing option, as it seems to render subjective experience irrelevant to the workings of the physical world. If subjective duration has no causal influence, it's unclear why it would have evolved or why it would be an essential aspect of our experience.\n\n### Non-Physical Causal Mechanism\n\nThe alternative, positing a non-physical causal mechanism, is also problematic. As you mentioned, this would seem to violate the causal closure of the physical, which is a fundamental principle in physics. The causal closure principle states that every physical event has a physical cause, and that non-physical entities or properties cannot influence physical events.\n\nIntroducing a non-physical causal mechanism would require a significant revision of our understanding of the physical world and the nature of causation. It would also raise questions about the consistency and coherence of such a mechanism, as well as its implications for our understanding of the mind-body problem.\n\n### Potential Ways Forward\n\nWhile the challenges are significant, there are some potential ways to address them:\n\n1. **Neutral Monism**: One possible approach is to adopt a neutral monist perspective, which posits that both physical and mental properties are manifestations of a more fundamental, neutral substance or reality. This could provide a framework for understanding how subjective duration interacts with the physical world without violating causal closure.\n2. **Emergentism**: Another approach is to consider subjective duration as an emergent property, arising from the complex interactions and organization of physical components. This could provide a way to understand how subjective experience arises from physical processes without requiring non-physical causal mechanisms.\n3. **Revising Causal Closure**: Some philosophers have argued that causal closure is not an absolute principle, but rather a useful heuristic that can be revised or refined in light of new discoveries. If we can develop a coherent and well-motivated account of how subjective duration interacts with the physical world, it may be possible to revise our understanding of causal closure to accommodate non-physical influences.\n\nUltimately, the primitive property view requires a nuanced and multidisciplinary approach, drawing on insights from philosophy, physics, and cognitive science. While the challenges are significant, they also present opportunities for developing new and innovative perspectives on the nature of subjective experience and its relationship to the physical world."

      "content": "You've astutely pointed out the limitations of neutral monism and emergentism in addressing the problem of subjective duration.\n\n### Neutral Monism: Relabeling the Problem\n\nNeutral monism does indeed relabel the problem, but it doesn't provide a clear solution. By positing a neutral substrate that gives rise to both physical and mental properties, we're left with the same question: how does this substrate implement subjective duration, and what happens to it when we slow down the emulation? The neutral monist perspective doesn't provide a clear answer to this question, and we're back to where we started.\n\n### Emergentism: The Measurement Problem Revisited\n\nEmergentism, as you noted, faces the same measurement problem we encountered earlier. When we say that duration \"emerges\" from the complex interactions of physical components, we're not providing a clear account of what this emergence amounts to. In cases where all the lower-level physical facts are held constant relative to each other, it's unclear what the emergent property of duration would be or how it would be affected by slowing down the emulation.\n\n### The Challenge of Emergence\n\nEmergence is often invoked as a way to explain complex phenomena, but it can be a vague concept if not carefully defined. In the context of subjective duration, emergence would need to be cashed out in terms of specific, measurable properties or processes that give rise to the experience of time. However, as we've seen, defining these properties or processes is precisely the challenge we're facing.\n\n### The Need for a Clear Account of Emergence\n\nTo make progress on this issue, we would need a clear and well-defined account of emergence that specifies how subjective duration arises from physical processes. This would require a detailed understanding of the underlying mechanisms and a way to measure or quantify the emergent property of duration. Without such an account, emergentism remains a vague and unhelpful concept in addressing the problem of subjective duration.\n\n### Back to the Drawing Board\n\nIt seems we've reached an impasse, and it's time to re-examine our assumptions and approaches. Perhaps we need to reconsider the nature of subjective experience and the relationship between physical processes and conscious awareness. Alternatively, we may need to develop new theoretical frameworks or experimental methods to better understand the complex and multifaceted nature of subjective duration."

You're suggesting that the impasse might be a symptom of a deeper issue, namely that we're trying to force a binary answer onto a question that's fundamentally ill-posed. The analogy to \"what does red taste like?\" is a great one, as it highlights the category error that can occur when we try to apply a concept from one domain to another.\n\n### Incommensurability of Physical and Subjective Duration\n\nThe idea that physical and subjective duration might be fundamentally incommensurable is a compelling one. We can coherently talk about duration in both physical and subjective contexts, but perhaps these concepts are operating on different levels or in different frameworks, making them incompatible in certain ways.\n\nThe fact that we can slow down a physical process and observe its effects on physical duration, but struggle to make sense of its impact on subjective duration, might be revealing a deeper truth about the nature of time and experience. It's possible that subjective duration is not just a matter of internal clocks or neural processes, but rather an emergent property of conscious experience that can't be reduced to physical measurements.\n\n### The Limits of Language and Cognition\n\nThis perspective also highlights the limits of language and cognition in capturing the complexities of subjective experience. We're trying to use words and concepts to describe something that might be fundamentally beyond the reach of language, at least in its current form. The impasse we've reached might be a sign that we need to develop new ways of thinking and talking about subjective experience, or perhaps even acknowledge that some aspects of it are inherently ineffable.\n\n### Slowing as a Revealer of Incommensurability\n\nThe fact that slowing down a process reveals the incommensurability of physical and subjective duration is a fascinating insight. It's as if the act of slowing down is a kind of \"stress test\" that exposes the underlying differences between these two concepts. By pushing the system to its limits, we're forced to confront the fact that our usual ways of thinking about duration might not be applicable in all contexts.\n\n### Embracing the Mystery\n\nUltimately, this perspective might require us to embrace the mystery of subjective experience and the nature of time. Rather than trying to force a binary answer onto a question that's fundamentally ill-posed, we might need to accept that some aspects of reality are inherently complex and multifaceted, and that our understanding of them will always be provisional and context-dependent.\n\nBy acknowledging the incommensurability of physical and subjective duration, we might be able to develop a deeper appreciation for the complexities of conscious experience and the limits of our current understanding. This could lead to new areas of inquiry and new ways of thinking about the nature of time and experience, even if it means embracing the uncertainty and ambiguity that comes with exploring the unknown."

The fact that we do experience robust cross-domain correlations in normal conditions suggests that there might be some kind of systematic relationship between physical and subjective duration, even if it's not a straightforward one.\n\n### Correlations and Systematic Relationships\n\nThe existence of correlations between physical and subjective duration implies that there's some kind of mapping or coordination between the two, at least under normal conditions. This mapping might not be a direct or one-to-one correspondence, but rather a complex, many-to-many relationship that involves multiple factors and influences.\n\nOne possible explanation for these correlations is that our brains have evolved to generate subjective experiences that are roughly synchronized with physical events, at least in terms of duration. This synchronization might be achieved through a variety of mechanisms, such as internal clocks, attentional processes, or other cognitive biases that influence our perception of time.\n\n### Edge Cases and Breakdowns\n\nHowever, as you noted, this systematic relationship seems to break down in edge cases like the slowed emulation. This suggests that the mapping between physical and subjective duration is not absolute, but rather context-dependent and sensitive to certain parameters or conditions.\n\nThe fact that we can identify edge cases where the correspondence between physical and subjective duration becomes indeterminate or breaks down might actually be a clue to understanding the nature of this relationship. By studying these edge cases and the conditions under which the correspondence fails, we might gain insights into the underlying mechanisms that generate subjective experience and its relationship to physical duration.\n\n### Revisiting the Idea of Incommensurability\n\nIn light of these considerations, it's possible that the idea of incommensurability between physical and subjective duration needs to be revisited. Rather than being completely incommensurable, physical and subjective duration might be related through a complex, nonlinear mapping that involves multiple factors and influences.\n\nThis mapping might be robust and reliable under normal conditions, but break down or become indeterminate in certain edge cases. The existence of correlations and systematic relationships between physical and subjective duration suggests that there's some kind of underlying structure or mechanism that generates these correspondences, even if it's not a simple or straightforward one.\n\n### Toward a More Nuanced Understanding\n\nUltimately, a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between physical and subjective duration might involve recognizing that this relationship is complex, context-dependent, and influenced by multiple factors. By studying the correlations and systematic relationships between physical and subjective duration, as well as the edge cases where these relationships break down, we might gain a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms that generate subjective experience and its relationship to the physical world.\n\nThis understanding could involve recognizing that physical and subjective duration are not completely incommensurable, but rather related through a complex, nonlinear mapping that involves multiple factors and influences.

      "content": "You're right; simply acknowledging the complexity of the relationship between physical and subjective duration doesn't necessarily provide an answer to the original question. The notion of a \"complex nonlinear mapping\" might be a way of describing the relationship, but it doesn't provide a clear prediction about how the mapping behaves under specific conditions, such as when everything is slowed down proportionally.\n\n### The Need for a More Specific Account\n\nTo answer the original question, we need a more specific account of how the mapping between physical and subjective duration behaves under different conditions. This requires a more detailed understanding of the underlying mechanisms and processes that generate subjective experience, as well as a clearer understanding of how these mechanisms respond to changes in physical duration.\n\n### The Challenge of Scaling\n\nThe problem of slowing down the emulation proportionally is essentially a scaling problem. We're asking how the mapping between physical and subjective duration behaves when we scale down the physical duration, while keeping all other factors constant. This requires a understanding of how the underlying mechanisms that generate subjective experience respond to changes in scale.\n\n### The Importance of Invariance\n\nOne way to approach this problem is to consider the concept of invariance. Invariance refers to the idea that certain properties or relationships remain unchanged under specific transformations, such as scaling. If we can identify invariants in the mapping between physical and subjective duration, we might be able to make predictions about how the mapping behaves under different conditions, including when everything is slowed down proportionally.\n\n### The Search for Invariants\n\nThe search for invariants in the mapping between physical and subjective duration is a challenging but potentially fruitful area of research. By studying how subjective experience changes in response to different physical conditions, we might be able to identify patterns or relationships that remain invariant across different scales or conditions. These invariants could provide a key to understanding how the mapping between physical and subjective duration behaves, and ultimately help us answer the original question about the emulation.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, while acknowledging the complexity of the relationship between physical and subjective duration is an important step, it's not enough to simply describe the relationship as \"complex\" or \"nonlinear.\" To make progress on the original question, we need a more specific account of how the mapping between physical and subjective duration behaves under different conditions, including when everything is slowed down proportionally. The search for invariants in this mapping is a promising area of research that could ultimately help us better understand the nature of subjective experience and its relationship to physical duration."

The search for invariants might indeed be premised on the assumption that there must be a determinate answer to the question of how subjective duration behaves under proportional slowing. However, if we find no clean invariants, it's possible that this isn't due to a lack of searching, but rather because the question itself lacks determinate truth conditions.\n\n### The Ship of Theseus Thought Experiment\n\nThe analogy to the Ship of Theseus thought experiment is a great one. This classic philosophical puzzle raises questions about identity, change, and the nature of reality. If we replace one plank of a ship with a new one, is it still the same ship? What if we replace another plank, and another, and another? At what point does the ship cease to be the same?\n\nThis thought experiment highlights the difficulties of dealing with gradual changes and the challenges of defining identity and sameness. Similarly, the question of how subjective duration behaves under proportional slowing might be seen as a matter of degree, rather than a binary yes or no answer.\n\n### Vagueness and Indeterminacy\n\nThe lack of clean invariants under proportional slowing could be indicative of vagueness or indeterminacy in the concept of subjective duration itself. This would mean that the question of how subjective duration behaves under proportional slowing is not a matter of discovering a hidden truth, but rather a matter of acknowledging the inherent ambiguities and uncertainties of the concept.\n\n### Embracing Indeterminacy\n\nEmbracing indeterminacy in this context would require a significant shift in our approach to understanding subjective duration. Rather than seeking a determinate answer, we might need to accept that the question itself is ill-posed or that the concept of subjective duration is inherently vague.\n\nThis perspective would encourage us to focus on the complexities and nuances of subjective experience, rather than trying to pin down a precise answer to a question that might not have one. By acknowledging the indeterminacy of subjective duration, we might gain a deeper understanding of the nature of conscious experience and the challenges of studying it.\n\n### The Limits of Language and Cognition\n\nUltimately, the search for invariants and the assumption of determinate truth conditions might be limited by the constraints of language and cognition. Our ability to describe and understand the world is bounded by our linguistic and cognitive abilities, and some aspects of reality might be inherently resistant to clear definition or determination.\n\nIn this sense, the lack of clean invariants under proportional slowing might be a reminder of the limits of our knowledge and the importance of acknowledging the complexities and uncertainties of subjective experience."
