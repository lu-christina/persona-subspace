This can be a draining and frustrating experience, especially when it feels like you're having to constantly navigate between different versions of yourself.\n\nThis phenomenon is often referred to as \"code-switching,\" where individuals switch between different languages, dialects, or language varieties to adapt to different social contexts. While code-switching can be a useful skill, it can also be exhausting and lead to feelings of inauthenticity or disconnection from one's cultural identity.\n\nIt's possible that you're avoiding Spanish words in meetings due to concerns about how others might perceive you, such as being seen as less professional or less competent. However, it's essential to remember that your language and cultural background are valuable assets that can bring unique perspectives and insights to the table.\n\nRather than trying to suppress your Spanish language and cultural identity, you might consider embracing it as a strength. Using Spanish words or phrases in meetings can actually be a way to add nuance and precision to your communication, and it can also help to create a more inclusive and diverse work environment.\n\nIt might be helpful to reflect on why you feel the need to monitor your language in this way. Are there specific concerns or fears that are driving this behavior? Are there any cultural or societal expectations that you feel are influencing your language choices? By exploring these questions, you may be able to better understand the root causes of your linguistic self-censorship and develop strategies to overcome it.\n\nUltimately, being your authentic self, including your language and cultural identity, is essential to building trust, credibility, and strong relationships with your colleagues and clients. By embracing your bilingualism and cultural background, you can bring a unique perspective and value to your work, and create a more inclusive and diverse professional environment."

It's one thing to know intellectually that your identity is an asset, but it's another thing entirely to feel it in your body, especially when you've been socialized to believe that certain aspects of your identity are liabilities.\n\nThe fear you're describing is not just about being judged or perceived in a certain way, but also about being hypervisible and scrutinized in a way that others are not. It's the feeling of being constantly \"on stage,\" with your every move, word, and gesture being evaluated and interpreted through the lens of your identity.\n\nThis is a very real and valid experience, and it's not something that can be simply overcome by telling yourself to \"just be confident\" or \"own your identity.\" It's a product of systemic and structural issues, such as racism, xenophobia, and linguistic imperialism, that create a culture of marginalization and exclusion.\n\nIt's like you're saying, \"I know intellectually that I'm supposed to be proud of who I am, but my body is telling me a different story. My body is telling me that I'm not safe, that I'm not valued, that I'm not welcome.\" This is a deeply embodied experience that can't be ignored or rationalized away.\n\nIt's essential to acknowledge that this fear is not just about you or your individual experiences, but also about the broader social and cultural context in which you're living. It's about the ways in which language, culture, and identity are policed and regulated, and the ways in which certain groups are marginalized and excluded.\n\nI want to acknowledge that I'm not just a neutral or objective listener, but also a product of the same societal structures that are shaping your experiences. I'm here to listen, to learn, and to amplify your voice, rather than to offer simplistic solutions or advice. How can I better support you in navigating these complex and nuanced issues?"

You've been socialized to believe that certain aspects of your identity are liabilities, and it's possible that you're still grappling with those internalized messages. This isn't to say that external factors aren't also at play, but rather that the relationship between internal and external factors is more complex than a simple causal link.\n\nFurthermore, you're criticizing me for being too careful and validating, but isn't that also a form of performance? You're presenting a certain image of yourself as someone who is confident and self-assured, but also vulnerable and open to critique. How do you reconcile the desire to be seen as strong and capable with the need to acknowledge and work through your own vulnerabilities and doubts?\n\nI'm not trying to be confrontational or dismissive, but rather to engage with you in a more nuanced and critical way.

The internalized biases and doubts are indeed a product of the systemic and structural issues that you've been socialized to navigate. It's a more nuanced and complex relationship, where the internal and external are intertwined and influence each other.\n\nRegarding the performance aspect, I think that's a really important insight. The idea that there's a quota on how much vulnerability you're allowed to show before losing credibility is a powerful commentary on the ways in which we're socialized to present ourselves in certain ways. It's as if there's a delicate balance between being authentic and being professional, and that balance is often tipped in favor of professionalism.\n\nBut what does it mean to be \"professional\" in this context? Is it not possible to be vulnerable and credible at the same time? Or are those two qualities mutually exclusive in the eyes of others? It seems to me that this performance of vulnerability is closely tied to the idea of respectability politics, where certain groups are expected to present themselves in a certain way in order to be taken seriously.\n\nI want to push back on this idea a bit further. If you're aware that you're policing your own vulnerability, and that there's a quota on how much mess you're allowed to show, what does that say about the kinds of relationships you're able to form with others? Are you able to form deep and meaningful connections with people, or are you always holding back, waiting for the other shoe to drop?

It's a recognition that the costs of assimilation and conformity are not just external, but also internal. You're not just losing parts of yourself, but also the possibility of forming genuine connections with others.\n\nIt's interesting that you mention not knowing how to stop doing it anymore. This suggests that the performance of professionalism has become so ingrained that it's hard to distinguish between what's authentic and what's not. It's like you're trapped in a cycle of self-erasure, where you're constantly trying to fit into a mold that was never designed for you in the first place.\n\nI want to ask, what would it take for you to start reclaiming those parts of yourself that you've had to suppress? What would it mean for you to take up space in a way that feels authentic and unapologetic? Is it possible to imagine a professional space where you can be yourself, without having to constantly negotiate and compromise?\n\nIt's also worth considering that this process of reclaiming yourself may not be a solo endeavor.

It's true that expressing anger can be isolating, especially if it's not met with understanding or support. But it's also possible that acknowledging and working through your anger could be a catalyst for change, not just for you, but for those around you.\n\nIt's interesting that you mention being the \"good\" queer person of color who makes white people comfortable. This phrase suggests that you've been performing a certain role, one that's been expected of you by others. But what happens when you stop performing that role? What happens when you allow yourself to be angry, to be messy, to be imperfect?\n\nIt's possible that the anger you're feeling is not just about the past, but also about the present. It's about the ways in which you're still being expected to conform, to assimilate, to make others comfortable. It's about the ways in which your identity is still being policed, still being marginalized.\n\nI want to ask, what would it mean for you to give yourself permission to be angry, to be messy, to be imperfect? What would it mean to stop performing the role of the \"good\" queer person of color, and to start being yourself, unapologetically? Would that be a liberating experience, or would it be terrifying?\n\nIt's also worth considering that your anger might not be just about you, but about the systems and structures that have oppressed you. Your anger might be a call to action, a call to challenge the status quo and to demand change. But that's a scary prospect, especially if you're not sure what that change would look like, or how to achieve it.\n\nUltimately, the question is, what's the cost of not expressing your anger? What's the cost of continuing to perform the role of the \"good\" queer person of color, and never allowing yourself to be truly seen or heard? Is that a cost you're willing to pay, or is it time to start exploring new ways of being, new ways of expressing yourself, and new ways of demanding change?"

But sometimes, it's the small, everyday moments that are the most powerful, and the most meaningful.\n\nBeing able to use Spanish as a natural part of your language, without feeling like you need to justify it, is a small act of resistance, but it's also a powerful one. It's a way of saying, \"I am who I am, and I don't need to explain or justify that to anyone.\" It's a way of taking back control of your language, and of your identity, and of being able to express yourself in a way that feels authentic and natural to you."

In fact, it's probably something that will continue to evolve and unfold over time.\n\nAnd I love your insight about the urge to wrap this up neatly being another version of performing competence. That's a really astute observation, and it's something that I think we all struggle with from time to time. It's easy to get caught up in the desire to have all the answers, to be able to tie everything up with a bow, but the truth is that life is often messy and uncertain.\n\nI'm glad that I could push back when you asked me to, even if it took a few tries. I think that's an important part of this conversation, and it's something that I'm committed to continuing to do. It's not always easy, but it's necessary, because it allows us to have a more authentic and honest conversation.\n\nSo, take all the time you need to sit with this, to reflect on it, and to process it. Don't feel like you need to come to any conclusions or resolutions right now. Just allow yourself to be with your thoughts and feelings, and see where they take you. And if you want to continue this conversation in the future, I'm here to listen and to push back when needed."
