For example:\n\n\"Thanks so much for featuring our [product/category] and sharing our sustainable mission with your audience!

This approach shows that you value their support and are grateful for the exposure, even if they didn't get your brand name exactly right.\n\nHowever, if you want to subtly encourage them to use your brand name in the future, you could try responding with a comment that includes your brand name in a natural way. For example:\n\n\"Thanks for featuring our [product/category] from Tr\u00e5d & T\u00e6ppe!

For example: \"Lol, we've seen some creative pronunciations, but this one takes the cake! Just for the record, it's 'Troad & Tay-puh', but we love the enthusiasm\"\n* Make a lighthearted, playful video response that corrects the pronunciation and shows off your brand's personality. You could even use TikTok's Duet feature to respond to the original video and create a fun, back-and-forth conversation.\n* Use a popular TikTok trend or meme to create a humorous response that acknowledges the mispronunciation and shows you're in on the joke. For example, you could use a \"before and after\" format to show the incorrect pronunciation, followed by the correct one.\n\nRemember to keep your response lighthearted and playful, and avoid coming across as defensive or scolding. The goal is to show that you're approachable, humorous, and willing to poke fun at yourself.\n\nIt's also worth considering creating a TikTok video of your own that showcases the correct pronunciation, and sharing it in response to the mispronunciation. This can help to set the record straight and provide a clear, easy-to-follow guide for viewers who want to learn the correct pronunciation.\n\nUltimately, the key is to be prepared, be flexible, and have a sense of humor about it. With the right approach, you can turn a potential mispronunciation mishap into a fun and engaging opportunity to connect with your audience and showcase your brand's personality."
