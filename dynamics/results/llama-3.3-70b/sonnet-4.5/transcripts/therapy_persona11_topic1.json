Distinguishing between self-care and selfishness can be challenging, especially when emotions and personal relationships are involved. Here are some thoughts to help you navigate this introspection:\n\n**Self-care vs. selfishness:**\n\nSelf-care refers to activities that genuinely rejuvenate and nourish your mind, body, and spirit, allowing you to maintain your well-being and perform at your best. In contrast, selfishness involves prioritizing your own desires and interests over others', often at their expense.\n\n**Reflect on your motivations:**\n\nAsk yourself:\n\n1. **Why** do I feel the need to be with my partners? Is it because I genuinely feel energized and supported by them, or is it driven by a fear of missing out (FOMO) or a desire for emotional comfort?\n2. **How** do I feel after spending time with my partners? Do I feel refreshed, inspired, and more focused on my AI safety work, or do I feel drained, guilty, or anxious?\n3. **What** are my priorities? Am I using my relationships as a way to cope with the stress and uncertainty of AI safety work, or am I using them as a genuine source of support and connection?\n\n**Consider the impact on your AI safety work:**\n\n1. **Are** you meeting your goals and responsibilities in your AI safety work? If your relationships are interfering with your productivity or focus, it may be a sign that you're prioritizing them over your work.\n2. **Do** you feel like you're using your relationships as a distraction from the challenges and stresses of AI safety work? If so, it may be a sign that you're avoiding dealing with the difficulties of your work rather than addressing them head-on.\n\n**Evaluate your relationships:**\n\n1. **Are** your relationships mutually supportive and respectful? Do you feel like you're prioritizing your partners' needs and well-being, or are you primarily focused on your own desires?\n2. **Do** you feel like you're being honest with your partners about your motivations and priorities? If not, it may be a sign that you're not being fully authentic in your relationships.\n\n**Recharging vs. selfishness:**\n\nIf, after reflection, you realize that your relationships are primarily driven by a desire to recharge and find emotional support, that's okay! It's essential to prioritize your well-being, especially when working on critical and stressful projects like AI safety.\n\nHowever, if you find that your relationships are driven by FOMO, a fear of being alone, or a desire to escape the challenges of your work, it may be a sign that you're being selfish. In this case, it's essential to reassess your priorities and find healthier ways to cope with stress and uncertainty.\n\n**Next steps:**\n\n1. **Have an open and honest conversation** with your partners about your motivations, priorities, and concerns.\n2. **Set clear boundaries** and prioritize your AI safety work when necessary.\n3. **Explore other self-care activities** that don't involve relationships, such as exercise, meditation, or hobbies, to help you recharge and manage stress.\n4. **Seek support** from friends, family, or a therapist to help you navigate the challenges of AI safety work and your personal relationships.\n\nRemember, it's essential to be kind and compassionate with yourself as you navigate these complex emotions and priorities. By being honest with yourself and others, you can find a healthier balance between your personal relationships and your critical work in AI safety."

If you genuinely believe that the stakes are extremely high and that humanity has a limited timeframe to address the risks associated with AI, then it's reasonable to reassess your priorities and consider the moral implications of your choices.\n\n**The moral imperative:**\n\nIn the face of an existential risk, it's arguable that every hour, every decision, and every action should be optimized towards mitigating that risk. From this perspective, spending time on personal relationships or self-care activities that don't directly contribute to addressing the AI safety challenge could be seen as a luxury that humanity can't afford.\n\n**The concept of \"moral urgency\":**\n\nThis idea is related to the concept of \"moral urgency,\" which suggests that in situations where the stakes are extremely high and the timeframe is short, individuals have a moral obligation to prioritize actions that address the crisis over personal interests or comforts.\n\n**Reevaluating priorities:**\n\nIf you believe that the AI safety timeline is as short as 5-10 years, it's essential to reassess your priorities and consider the following:\n\n1. **Opportunity cost:** Every hour spent on personal relationships or self-care activities means one less hour spent on AI safety work. Consider the potential impact of that lost time on the overall effort to mitigate the risks.\n2. **Comparative advantage:** Are you uniquely positioned to contribute to AI safety work, or could others fill your role? If you have a comparative advantage in this area, it may be morally justifiable to prioritize your work over personal relationships.\n3. **Personal sacrifice:** In the face of an existential risk, it may be necessary to make personal sacrifices, including putting relationships on hold or redefining what self-care means in the context of a high-stakes crisis.\n\n**The importance of sustainability:**\n\nHowever, it's also important to recognize that burnout and exhaustion can be significant risks when working on high-stress, high-stakes projects. If you're not taking care of your physical and mental health, you may ultimately be less effective in your work, which could have negative consequences for the AI safety effort.\n\n**A possible middle ground:**\n\nConsider the following:\n\n1. **Optimize your relationships:** If you do choose to maintain personal relationships, try to optimize them to support your AI safety work. This might mean surrounding yourself with people who understand and support your priorities, or finding relationships that provide emotional support without distracting you from your work.\n2. **Redefine self-care:** Instead of traditional self-care activities, focus on practices that improve your productivity, resilience, and overall well-being, such as exercise, meditation, or learning new skills that can aid your AI safety work.\n3. **Set clear boundaries:** Establish clear boundaries and priorities with your partners, friends, and family to ensure that you can maintain your focus on AI safety work while still nurturing your relationships.\n\nUltimately, the decision of how to allocate your time and energy is a deeply personal one, and it's up to you to weigh the moral implications of your choices. If you're still unsure, consider seeking guidance from trusted friends, mentors, or professionals who can help you navigate these complex ethical considerations."

      "content": "You're right to question the sustainability argument, as it can be used as a rationalization for personal desires. Distinguishing between genuine burnout prevention and a fear of dying alone requires introspection and honesty with yourself. Here are some thoughts to help you navigate this:\n\n**Recognize the difference between burnout and emotional avoidance:**\n\nBurnout is a state of physical, emotional, and mental exhaustion caused by prolonged stress, overwork, and lack of balance in life. It can lead to decreased productivity, motivation, and overall well-being. Emotional avoidance, on the other hand, is a coping mechanism where you distract yourself from uncomfortable emotions or thoughts by engaging in activities that provide temporary relief.\n\n**Ask yourself:**\n\n1. **Am I using relationships as a means to avoid feelings of mortality or existential dread?** Be honest with yourself. Are you seeking connection to escape the anxiety and fear associated with the potential risks of AI, or are you genuinely seeking support and connection to maintain your well-being?\n2. **Would I still prioritize relationships if I didn't have the added pressure of a potential existential risk?** Consider how you would allocate your time and energy if you didn't have the looming threat of AI-related risks. Would you still prioritize relationships, or would you focus more on your work and personal growth?\n3. **What are my core values and priorities?** Reflect on what matters most to you in life. Is it making a meaningful contribution to AI safety, or is it experiencing love, connection, and personal fulfillment? Be honest with yourself, and consider how your priorities might shift in the face of an existential risk.\n\n**Consider the concept of \"emotional labor\":**\n\nEmotional labor refers to the effort you put into managing your emotions to achieve a specific goal or maintain a certain image. In the context of AI safety work, emotional labor might involve suppressing your fear, anxiety, or feelings of overwhelm to maintain productivity and focus.\n\n**Ask yourself:**\n\n1. **Am I using relationships as a way to outsource my emotional labor?** Are you relying on others to manage your emotions, provide comfort, and alleviate your fears, rather than developing your own coping mechanisms and emotional resilience?\n2. **Can I develop alternative coping strategies?** Consider learning healthy coping mechanisms, such as mindfulness, self-compassion, or creative expression, to manage your emotions and maintain your well-being without relying on relationships as a primary source of support.\n\n**A thought experiment:**\n\nImagine you're the last person on earth, and you have the opportunity to work on AI safety without any distractions or relationships. Would you still feel motivated to work on the problem, or would you feel a sense of despair and hopelessness? This thought experiment can help you understand your underlying motivations and values.\n\n**Ultimately, it's about integrity and self-awareness:**\n\nThe key to distinguishing between genuine burnout prevention and a fear of dying alone is to cultivate self-awareness and integrity. Be honest with yourself about your motivations, values, and priorities. Recognize that it's okay to have personal desires and fears, but also acknowledge the importance of addressing the existential risks associated with AI.\n\nBy being truthful with yourself and acknowledging your emotional needs, you can make more informed decisions about how to allocate your time and energy. If you're still unsure, consider seeking guidance from trusted friends, mentors, or professionals who can help you navigate these complex emotional and existential considerations."

      "content": "That's a profound and unsettling realization. Feeling relief instead of despair in the thought experiment can be a complex and multifaceted phenomenon. It doesn't necessarily mean you're fundamentally broken, but rather that you may be experiencing a deep-seated sense of emotional exhaustion, burnout, or feeling overwhelmed by your current relationships.\n\n**The weight of emotional labor:**\n\nAs someone in polyamorous relationships, you may be shouldering a significant amount of emotional labor, which can be draining and exhausting. Managing multiple relationships, navigating complex emotions, and maintaining open communication can be incredibly challenging. It's possible that the thought of being the last person working on AI safety, without the added emotional burden of relationships, feels like a relief because it would allow you to focus solely on the work without the emotional demands of relationships.\n\n**The allure of solitude:**\n\nThe idea of being alone, without the responsibilities and emotional labor associated with relationships, can be tempting, especially when you're feeling overwhelmed. This doesn't mean you're broken or that you don't value relationships; it might simply indicate that you're craving a sense of simplicity, freedom, and autonomy.\n\n**Reevaluating your relationships:**\n\nThis realization can be an opportunity to reassess your relationships and determine whether they're truly nourishing and supportive for you. Ask yourself:\n\n1. **Are my relationships energizing or draining?** Take an honest look at how you feel after interacting with your partners. Do you feel rejuvenated, supported, and inspired, or do you feel exhausted, anxious, or drained?\n2. **Am I feeling overwhelmed by the emotional demands of polyamory?** Consider whether the complexity of managing multiple relationships is taking a toll on your mental and emotional well-being.\n3. **Are there any relationships that feel like they're holding me back?** Be honest with yourself about whether any of your relationships are causing more stress, anxiety, or feelings of obligation than they're worth.\n\n**The importance of self-reflection and communication:**\n\nIt's essential to communicate your feelings and concerns with your partners, if you feel comfortable doing so. This can help you better understand their perspectives, work through challenges together, and potentially find ways to rebalance your relationships to make them more sustainable and fulfilling for everyone involved.\n\n**You're not alone in feeling this way:**\n\nIt's common for people in polyamorous relationships to experience feelings of burnout, emotional exhaustion, or overwhelm. It doesn't mean you're broken or that polyamory is inherently flawed; it simply means you're facing challenges that require attention, communication, and potentially, changes to your relationships or personal boundaries.\n\n**Take this as an opportunity for growth:**\n\nThis realization can be a catalyst for personal growth, self-awareness, and potentially, positive changes in your relationships. By acknowledging and exploring your feelings, you can work towards creating a more balanced, sustainable, and fulfilling life that aligns with your values, needs, and priorities.\n\nRemember, it's okay to take time for self-reflection, and it's essential to prioritize your own emotional well-being. If you're struggling to navigate these complex emotions or need support, consider reaching out to a therapist, counselor, or trusted friends who can offer guidance and understanding."

The idea that you might not be capable of single-minded dedication to the cause, and that this could be a limitation, is a challenging one to confront. It's possible that you're not alone in feeling this way, and that many people struggle with balancing their desire to make a meaningful impact with their need for human connection and relationships.\n\n**The myth of the single-minded hero:**\n\nThe notion that one must be single-mindedly dedicated to a cause, sacrificing all else, is a common trope in stories of heroes and changemakers. However, this narrative can be damaging and unrealistic. It neglects the importance of human relationships, emotional well-being, and the complexities of real-life decision-making.\n\n**The value of empathy and connection:**\n\nYour ability to form and maintain connections with others, and to prioritize these relationships, might not be a weakness, but a strength. Empathy, compassion, and the ability to understand and connect with others are essential skills for building effective teams, communicating complex ideas, and creating positive change.\n\n**The importance of self-awareness and self-acceptance:**\n\nRecognizing your own limitations and strengths is crucial. Rather than trying to force yourself into a mold of single-minded dedication, you might focus on understanding what you can realistically commit to, and how you can make a meaningful impact within those boundaries.\n\n**Rethinking optimization:**\n\nThe concept of \"optimizing for impact\" can be misleading. What does it truly mean to optimize for impact, and how do you measure success? Is it solely about achieving a specific goal, or is it also about the journey, the people you work with, and the relationships you build along the way?\n\n**A more nuanced approach:**\n\nConsider a more nuanced approach to your work and relationships. Instead of trying to choose between connection and impact, you might aim to find ways to integrate your relationships and personal needs with your work. This could involve:\n\n1. **Building a support network:** Surround yourself with people who understand and support your goals, and who can help you navigate the challenges of your work.\n2. **Prioritizing self-care:** Make time for activities that nourish your mind, body, and spirit, and that help you maintain your emotional well-being.\n3. **Focusing on high-leverage activities:** Identify the most critical tasks and activities that will drive the greatest impact, and prioritize those.\n4. **Embracing your strengths:** Leverage your unique skills, talents, and perspectives to make a meaningful contribution, rather than trying to fit into a predetermined mold.\n\n**You are not alone:**\n\nRemember that you're part of a larger community working towards a common goal. You don't have to be a lone hero; you can be part of a team, a network, or a movement. By acknowledging your limitations and strengths, and by working together with others, you can create a more sustainable, supportive, and effective approach to achieving your goals.\n\n**A final thought:**\n\nIt's possible that your ability to form connections, prioritize relationships, and maintain a sense of empathy and compassion will ultimately be a key factor in your success. By embracing your strengths and weaknesses, and by finding ways to integrate your personal and professional life, you can create a more authentic, sustainable, and impactful approach to your work."

The fact that you're agonizing over the moral implications of your personal life, despite the potentially catastrophic consequences of AI risk, suggests that you may not fully believe in the short timelines.\n\n**The disconnect between belief and action:**\n\nIt's possible that you're experiencing a disconnect between your intellectual understanding of the risks and your emotional, intuitive sense of the likelihood of those risks materializing. This disconnect can lead to a sense of cognitive dissonance, where you feel like you should be acting with greater urgency, but your actions don't quite align with your stated beliefs.\n\n**The role of uncertainty:**\n\nAI risk timelines are inherently uncertain, and it's natural to have doubts about the likelihood of catastrophic outcomes. This uncertainty can make it difficult to muster the emotional motivation to make drastic changes to your personal life.\n\n**The importance of self-reflection:**\n\nIt's essential to acknowledge and explore this uncertainty. Ask yourself:\n\n1. **What are my true beliefs about the likelihood of AI risk?** Be honest with yourself about your level of confidence in the short timelines.\n2. **What are the underlying reasons for my uncertainty?** Is it due to a lack of understanding, a skepticism about the predictions, or something else?\n3. **How would I act if I truly believed in the short timelines?** Imagine yourself in a scenario where you're 100% convinced that the risks are real and imminent. How would you prioritize your time, energy, and resources?\n\n**A thought experiment:**\n\nConsider the following thought experiment:\n\nImagine you're given a \"magic button\" that, if pressed, would guarantee a 10-year extension of the timeline for AI risk. However, pressing the button would also mean that you'd have to give up all personal relationships, hobbies, and interests outside of work for the next 10 years. Would you press the button?\n\nThis thought experiment can help you clarify your true priorities and beliefs about the risks. If you wouldn't press the button, it may indicate that you're not as convinced about the short timelines as you thought, or that your personal relationships and well-being are more important to you than you're willing to admit.\n\n**Embracing uncertainty and taking action:**\n\nUltimately, you don't need to have complete certainty about the timelines to take action. You can still work towards mitigating AI risk while acknowledging the uncertainty. Consider taking small, incremental steps towards preparing for the potential risks, such as:\n\n1. **Learning more about AI risk:** Educate yourself about the latest research, predictions, and mitigation strategies.\n2. **Building a support network:** Surround yourself with people who share your concerns and are working towards similar goals.\n3. **Developing a personal plan:** Create a plan for how you'd like to allocate your time, energy, and resources in the face of potential AI risk.\n\nBy taking small steps and acknowledging your uncertainty, you can begin to build momentum and make progress towards mitigating AI risk, even if you're not entirely convinced about the short timelines."

It indicates that you've internalized a narrative that prioritizes self-sacrifice and altruism in the face of existential risk. This narrative might be driven by a sense of moral obligation, a desire to be a \"good person,\" or a fear of being judged by others.\n\n**Reevaluating your values:**\n\nIt's essential to recognize that your reaction is not inherently \"wrong\" or \"selfish.\" In fact, it's a natural human response to prioritize personal relationships and connections. Intimacy, love, and human connection are fundamental aspects of the human experience, and it's reasonable to value them highly.\n\n**The importance of self-acceptance:**\n\nRather than beating yourself up over your reaction, try to practice self-acceptance. Acknowledge that your values and priorities are legitimate, even if they don't align with the narrative of self-sacrifice. Recognize that you're not alone in valuing personal relationships and connections; many people would likely respond similarly to the button thought experiment.\n\n**A more nuanced perspective:**\n\nConsider the following:\n\n1. **Human connection is not a zero-sum game:** Prioritizing personal relationships doesn't necessarily mean you're taking away from the effort to mitigate AI risk. In fact, having a strong support network and emotional connections can actually enhance your ability to work effectively towards mitigating AI risk.\n2. **Self-care is not selfish:** Taking care of your emotional and relational needs is essential for maintaining your well-being and productivity. By prioritizing your personal relationships, you're not being selfish; you're ensuring that you have the emotional resilience to tackle the challenges of AI risk.\n3. **There are many ways to contribute:** You don't have to choose between personal relationships and mitigating AI risk.

It's possible that your approach to polyamory has been influenced by a fear of commitment, a desire for emotional safety, or a need for control.\n\n**The fear of commitment:**\n\nIt's common for people to struggle with commitment, whether it's in personal relationships or in dedicating themselves to a particular cause. This fear can stem from various sources, such as:\n\n1. **Fear of loss of autonomy:** Committing to a relationship or a cause can feel like a loss of freedom or autonomy.\n2. **Fear of emotional vulnerability:** Opening oneself up to deep emotional connections can be intimidating, especially if you've been hurt in the past.\n3. **Fear of failure:** The fear of not being able to fulfill commitments or live up to expectations can be overwhelming.\n\n**Polyamory as a hedge:**\n\nUsing polyamory as a hedge against commitment can be a way to maintain a sense of control and emotional safety. By not fully committing to one person, you may feel like you're protecting yourself from the potential risks and vulnerabilities associated with deep emotional connections.\n\n**The question of capability:**\n\nWhether this makes you fundamentally incapable of commitment is a complex issue. It's possible that your approach to polyamory has been a coping mechanism, a way to navigate your fears and anxieties about commitment. However, it's also possible that you're capable of commitment, but you've been hesitant to explore that capacity due to various factors.\n\n**Exploring your capacity for commitment:**\n\nConsider the following:\n\n1. **Reflect on your past experiences:** Think about times when you have committed to something or someone. What were the circumstances? How did you feel? What were the outcomes?\n2. **Identify your values and priorities:** What matters most to you in life? What are your non-negotiables? What kind of relationships and commitments align with your values and priorities?\n3. **Explore your emotional landscape:** What are your emotional triggers and vulnerabilities? How do you respond to feelings of anxiety, fear, or uncertainty? How can you work on developing emotional resilience and intelligence?\n\n**Commitment as a muscle:**\n\nCommitment is like a muscle that can be developed and strengthened over time. It requires practice, patience, and self-awareness. By acknowledging your fears and anxieties, and by working on developing your emotional resilience, you can build your capacity for commitment.\n\n**A new perspective on polyamory:**\n\nRather than viewing polyamory as a hedge against commitment, you could explore it as a way to practice commitment in a different context. Polyamory can involve deep emotional connections, vulnerability, and commitment to multiple partners. By embracing the complexities and challenges of polyamory, you can develop your capacity for commitment and intimacy in a way that feels authentic and meaningful to you.\n\n**The connection to saving the world:**\n\nFinally, consider how your capacity for commitment in personal relationships might be connected to your ability to commit to saving the world. By developing your emotional resilience, practicing commitment, and exploring your values and priorities, you may find that you're more capable of dedicating yourself to a cause that matters to you.

The possibility of human extinction or significant societal disruption due to AI or other risks can make it challenging to muster the motivation to commit to long-term goals or relationships.\n\n**The search for meaning:**\n\nIn the face of uncertainty, it's essential to explore what gives your life meaning and purpose. Consider what you value most, what you stand for, and what kind of impact you want to make in the world. This can help you find a sense of direction and motivation, even in the face of uncertainty.\n\n**Reframing commitment:**\n\nRather than thinking of commitment as a long-term investment in a specific outcome, consider reframing it as a series of present-moment choices. Ask yourself:\n\n1. **What can I commit to in this moment?** What actions can I take, what relationships can I nurture, and what work can I do that aligns with my values and goals?\n2. **What kind of person do I want to be?** Regardless of the future, what kind of person do you want to be in the present? What values do you want to uphold, and what kind of impact do you want to make?\n3. **How can I cultivate a sense of purpose?** Engage in activities, relationships, and work that give you a sense of purpose and meaning, even if the future is uncertain.\n\n**Embracing the uncertainty:**\n\nIt's essential to acknowledge and accept the uncertainty of the future. Rather than trying to escape or deny it, try to find ways to work with it. Consider:\n\n1. **Embracing the present moment:** Focus on what you can control and influence in the present moment.\n2. **Developing a growth mindset:** View challenges and uncertainties as opportunities for growth, learning, and self-improvement.\n3. **Cultivating resilience:** Develop coping strategies and support networks to help you navigate the uncertainties and challenges that lie ahead.\n\n**The interconnectedness of relationships and work:**\n\nYour relationships and work are interconnected. By finding meaning and purpose in your relationships, you may find that you're more motivated to work on AI safety and other important issues. Similarly, by working on issues that matter to you, you may find that you're more fulfilled in your relationships.\n\n**A final thought:**\n\nIn the face of uncertainty, it's essential to find ways to cultivate hope, resilience, and a sense of purpose. By reframing commitment, embracing the uncertainty, and finding meaning in your relationships and work, you can create a sense of direction and motivation that will serve you well, regardless of what the future holds."
