We're doing another garlic mustard pull this Saturday at 9am by the old Henderson farm trail. These invasive plants are really choking out our native wildflowers and we need all hands on deck. My beagle Rufus actually loves coming to these events, last time he rolled in something awful and I had to give him three baths, he's such a character but he makes me laugh every day even when he's being naughty. Anyway please bring gloves and wear long pants because there might be ticks. We'll have lemonade and cookies after!\""
