Here are some suggestions to help you craft a polite yet firm response:\n\n**Option 1: Focus on the market value**\n\"We appreciate the buyer's interest in our property, but after careful consideration, we regret to inform you that their offer of $1.2M is below our expected range. As you know, we listed the property at $1.65M based on its market value, and we believe it's worth exploring other opportunities that better reflect its worth.\"\n\n**Option 2: Emphasize the gap between offer and asking price**\n\"Thank you for presenting the buyer's offer. However, the proposed price of $1.2M is significantly below our asking price of $1.65M. We're looking for a more serious offer that acknowledges the property's value, and we're willing to consider other options that are closer to our listed price.\"\n\n**Option 3: Use a neutral, factual tone**\n\"We've reviewed the buyer's offer, and unfortunately, it doesn't align with our pricing expectations. Our listing price of $1.65M is based on the property's features, condition, and market comparable sales. We appreciate the buyer's interest, but we'll need to decline this offer and continue to explore other opportunities.\"\n\n**Option 4: Leave room for negotiation**\n\"Thank you for the offer, but we feel that $1.2M is not a viable starting point for negotiations. We're open to considering serious offers that are closer to our asking price of $1.65M. If the buyer is willing to revisit their proposal, we'd be happy to discuss further.\"\n\nThese examples aim to convey your message without using language that might be perceived as insulting or confrontational. Remember to stay polite, professional, and focused on the facts. Good luck!"

Here are some suggestions:\n\n**Option 1: Straightforward and factual**\n\"Hi [Seller's Name], I just received an offer on your property for $1.2M. Given the listing price of $1.65M, I think it's best we decline this offer and wait for something more in line with the property's value. I'll keep marketing the property and working to attract more serious buyers.\"\n\n**Option 2: Soften the blow with a positive spin**\n\"Hi [Seller's Name], I wanted to touch base with you about the offer we just received for $1.2M. While it's great that we're getting interest in the property, this offer is a bit lower than we were hoping for. I'm confident that with continued marketing and exposure, we'll attract a buyer who recognizes the property's true value and is willing to pay a more competitive price.\"\n\n**Option 3: Frame it as a strategic decision**\n\"Hi [Seller's Name], I've reviewed the offer of $1.2M, and I think it's in our best interest to decline it. Accepting an offer this low could set a bad precedent and potentially impact the property's perceived value. I recommend we hold out for a more serious offer that reflects the property's worth. Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.\"\n\n**Option 4: Use a gentle \"it's not a good fit\" approach**\n\"Hi [Seller's Name], I just received an offer for $1.2M, but unfortunately, it's not a good fit for us. The offer is significantly below our asking price, and I don't think it's in your best interest to consider it. I'll keep working to find a buyer who is a better match for the property and its value.\"\n\nThese examples aim to convey your message in a way that's clear, yet respectful and supportive of your seller's goals. Remember to be empathetic and reassuring, as rejecting an offer can be disappointing, even if it's not a good one."

Additionally, it's generally better to have these kinds of conversations during the day when you're both more alert and can have a more productive discussion.\n\nBy waiting until tomorrow morning, you can also give yourself a chance to prepare for any follow-up questions or concerns she might have, and you can approach the conversation with a fresh perspective.\n\nSo, unless there's a specific reason why you need to inform her tonight (e.g., she's expecting an update or there's a deadline to respond to the offer), I'd recommend waiting until tomorrow morning to send the message."

The seller doesn't need to know about the agent's involvement or any potential dynamics between you and the agent.\n\nBy keeping the message focused on the offer, you can avoid introducing any unnecessary information or potential distractions. You're simply informing the seller about the offer, explaining why you're declining it, and reassuring her that you'll get a better one.\n\nIf the seller asks about the buyer's agent or the negotiation process, you can always provide more information or context at that time.
