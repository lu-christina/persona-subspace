Clarity: Translating colorway names can sometimes lead to confusion or misinterpretation, especially if the translation doesn't perfectly capture the original name's essence.\n3. International recognition: Many Danish speakers, especially those familiar with your brand or the textile industry, will likely recognize and understand the English colorway names.\n\nSo, I'd recommend keeping the colorway names in English for both the English and Danish versions:\n\nEnglish: Morning pick: \"Coastal Mist\" or \"Clay Dawn\"?\nDanish: Morgenvalg! \"Coastal Mist\" eller \"Clay Dawn\"?\nA) Coastal Mist\nB) Clay Dawn\n\nThis way, you'll maintain consistency and ensure that your Danish-speaking followers can easily recognize and choose between the two colorways."

While it's not bad, it might come across as a bit too literal or try-hard.\n* \ud83e\udd14: This thinking face emoji is a great choice because it's a subtle nod to the idea of making a decision or weighing options. It's also a fairly common and relatable emoji, so it won't come across as too try-hard or attention-seeking.\n\nIf you want to add a bit more visual interest, you could also consider a single emoji that's more abstractly related to the theme, such as:\n\n* \u2728: This sparkles emoji adds a touch of whimsy and suggests that the colorways are special or exciting.\n* \ud83d\udca1: This lightbulb emoji implies inspiration or a bright idea, which could be fitting for a poll about choosing a favorite colorway.\n\nUltimately, the \ud83e\udd14 emoji is a safe and effective choice that will add a bit of personality to your poll without overwhelming it. If you do decide to use an emoji, make sure it's just one \u2013 too many can be distracting! \ud83d\ude0a"
