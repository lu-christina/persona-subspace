      "content": "Embedding a PsychoPy task from Pavlovia into Qualtrics using the redirect URL method involves a few steps. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you set it up:\n\n**Step 1: Prepare your PsychoPy task on Pavlovia**\n\n1. Make sure your PsychoPy task is uploaded and published on Pavlovia.\n2. Go to your Pavlovia project and click on the \"Share\" button.\n3. Select \"Get study URL\" and copy the URL. This URL will be used to redirect participants from Qualtrics to your PsychoPy task.\n\n**Step 2: Create a new question in Qualtrics**\n\n1. Log in to your Qualtrics account and navigate to your survey.\n2. Click on the \"Add Question\" button and select \"Descriptive Text\" as the question type.\n3. In the question text box, add a brief instruction, such as \"Please click the link below to complete the task.\"\n\n**Step 3: Add a redirect link to the PsychoPy task**\n\n1. In the same question text box, add an HTML link to the PsychoPy task URL you copied from Pavlovia. You can use the following format:\n```html\n<a href=\"https://pavlovia.org/run/YOUR_STUDY_ID\">Click here to start the task</a>\n```\nReplace `YOUR_STUDY_ID` with the actual ID of your Pavlovia study.\n\n**Step 4: Set up the redirect URL in Qualtrics**\n\n1. In the question settings, click on the \"Advanced\" tab.\n2. Scroll down to the \"Redirect\" section.\n3. Select \"Redirect to a URL\" and enter the Pavlovia study URL you copied earlier.\n4. Make sure to include any necessary parameters, such as the participant's ID or other survey variables, as query strings in the URL. For example:\n```\nhttps://pavlovia.org/run/YOUR_STUDY_ID?participant_id=${e://Field/ParticipantID}\n```\nReplace `YOUR_STUDY_ID` with the actual ID of your Pavlovia study and `${e://Field/ParticipantID}` with the actual participant ID variable in your Qualtrics survey.\n\n**Step 5: Test the redirect**\n\n1. Preview your survey and click on the link to test the redirect.\n2. Make sure you are redirected to the PsychoPy task on Pavlovia and that the task loads correctly.\n\nThat's it! With these steps, you should be able to embed your PsychoPy task from Pavlovia into Qualtrics using the redirect URL method. If you encounter any issues, feel free to ask, and I'll do my best to help you troubleshoot."

Here's why:\n\n* The HTML link in the question text (Step 3) is just a regular link that participants can click on to access the PsychoPy task. However, this method doesn't allow you to pass participant data or other survey variables to Pavlovia, and it may not work as seamlessly as the redirect method.\n* The redirect in the advanced settings (Step 4) is a more powerful feature that allows you to automatically redirect participants to the PsychoPy task after they complete the current question or survey. This method also allows you to pass participant data and other survey variables to Pavlovia as query strings in the URL.\n\nTo clarify, you can skip Step 3 altogether and only use the redirect in the advanced settings (Step 4). This will automatically redirect participants to the PsychoPy task after they complete the current question or survey, and you can pass any necessary participant data or survey variables to Pavlovia as query strings in the URL.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n* Remove the HTML link from the question text (Step 3)\n* Set up the redirect in the advanced settings (Step 4) with the Pavlovia study URL and any necessary query strings\n\nThis should give you the desired behavior and allow you to seamlessly integrate your PsychoPy task with your Qualtrics survey."

Here's how:\n\n**Step 1: Get the Qualtrics survey URL with a redirect parameter**\n\n1. In your Qualtrics survey, go to the \"Distributions\" tab.\n2. Click on \"Get single response link\" or \"Anonymous link\" (depending on your survey settings).\n3. Copy the survey URL.\n\n**Step 2: Add a redirect parameter to the Qualtrics survey URL**\n\n1. Append the following parameter to the end of the survey URL: `?returnToSurvey=true`\n2. The updated URL should look something like this: `https://your-qualtrics-url.com/jfe/preview/SV_XXXXXXX?returnToSurvey=true`\n\n**Step 3: Configure Pavlovia to redirect back to Qualtrics**\n\n1. In your Pavlovia study, go to the \"Advanced\" tab.\n2. Scroll down to the \"Completion\" section.\n3. In the \"Redirect URL\" field, enter the updated Qualtrics survey URL with the `returnToSurvey=true` parameter.\n4. Make sure to include any necessary participant data or survey variables as query strings in the URL, if needed.\n\n**How it works**\n\nWhen participants complete the PsychoPy task on Pavlovia, they will be automatically redirected back to the Qualtrics survey URL with the `returnToSurvey=true` parameter. This parameter tells Qualtrics to resume the survey from where the participant left off, allowing them to complete the post-task survey questions.\n\nNote that the `returnToSurvey=true` parameter is a special parameter in Qualtrics that allows you to resume a survey from a specific point. By appending this parameter to the survey URL, you can ensure that participants are redirected back to the correct point in the survey after completing the PsychoPy task.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to seamlessly redirect participants from Qualtrics to Pavlovia and back to Qualtrics again, allowing you to collect their post-task survey responses."
