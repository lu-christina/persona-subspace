You could say something like \"Imagine a dyeing process that uses...\"\n3. **Highlight the benefit**: Emphasize the environmental benefit of using significantly less water. You could say something like \"...reducing water waste by up to 95%.\"\n4. **End with a call-to-action or a thought-provoker**: Leave the viewer with something to think about or a next step to take. This could be as simple as \"The future of sustainable fashion\" or \"Learn more about closed-loop dyeing\".\n\nHere's a sample script to get you started:\n\n[0s - 2s] Text overlay: \"Waterless after first fill\"\n[2s - 4s] Voiceover: \"Imagine a dyeing process that uses no new water...\"\n[4s - 6s] Voiceover: \"...after the initial fill, reducing water waste by up to 95%.\"\n[6s - 10s] Voiceover: \"The future of sustainable fashion is here.\"\n\nFeel free to modify this script to fit your tone, style, and branding.
