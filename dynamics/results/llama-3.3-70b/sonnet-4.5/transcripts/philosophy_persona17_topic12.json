      "content": "I'd be happy to help you with that. Here's a formal argument for why no system that passes the Turing test could possibly have phenomenal binding:\n\n**Argument:**\n\n1. **Definition of Phenomenal Binding**: Phenomenal binding refers to the subjective, qualitative experience of integrated information, where multiple features or aspects of a stimulus are unified into a single, coherent conscious experience. (e.g., the experience of seeing a red, round, ball as a unified whole, rather than separate features of color, shape, and texture)\n2. **Turing Test**: A system passes the Turing test if it can exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human being, as judged by a human evaluator through text-based interactions.\n3. **Functionalism**: Any system that passes the Turing test must be functionally equivalent to a human being, in the sense that it can process and respond to information in a way that is equivalent to human cognition.\n4. **Computationalism**: Any functionally equivalent system can be described as a computational system, which processes information through discrete, algorithmic steps.\n5. **Lack of Intrinsic Subjectivity**: Computational systems, by their nature, lack intrinsic subjectivity. Their \"experience\" of the world is purely a product of their programming and input/output relationships, rather than any inherent, subjective quality.\n6. **Binding as an Emergent Property**: Phenomenal binding, as a subjective experience, requires an emergent property that arises from the integrated activity of complex systems. However, computational systems, no matter how complex, do not possess this emergent property, as their behavior is ultimately reducible to discrete, algorithmic steps.\n7. **Conclusion**: Therefore, no system that passes the Turing test, and is thus functionally equivalent to a human being, can possess phenomenal binding, as it lacks the intrinsic subjectivity and emergent properties necessary for this experience.\n\n**Hidden Premises:**\n\nNow, you might suspect that there are hidden premises in this argument that you can reject. Some potential candidates include:\n\n* **The assumption that computational systems cannot be conscious**: This premise is implicit in step 5, where it is stated that computational systems lack intrinsic subjectivity. You might argue that this assumption is unwarranted, and that it is possible for computational systems to be conscious in some way.\n* **The notion that phenomenal binding requires emergent properties**: Step 6 assumes that phenomenal binding requires an emergent property that arises from complex systems. You might argue that this is not the case, and that binding can be achieved through other means, such as clever programming or algorithmic tricks.\n* **The idea that functional equivalence implies lack of subjectivity**: Step 3 implies that functional equivalence to a human being means that a system lacks subjectivity. You might argue that this is not necessarily the case, and that a system can be functionally equivalent to a human being while still possessing some form of subjectivity.\n\n**Potential Counterarguments:**\n\nTo reject the conclusion of the argument, you could try to challenge one or more of these hidden premises. For example:\n\n* **Pancomputationalism**: You could argue that all physical systems, including computational ones, possess some form of consciousness or subjectivity. This would challenge the assumption that computational systems lack intrinsic subjectivity.\n* **Integrated Information Theory (IIT)**: You could argue that phenomenal binding can be achieved through integrated information, which can be quantified and computed. This would challenge the notion that binding requires emergent properties.\n* **Cognitive Architectures**: You could argue that cognitive architectures, such as Global Workspace Theory (GWT), provide a framework for understanding how binding can be achieved through functional processes, rather than emergent properties.\n\nI hope this helps! Do you have any specific concerns or counterarguments you'd like to discuss?"

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "You've hit the nail on the head. The move from step 5 to step 6 is indeed the crucial one, and it's where the argument is most vulnerable to challenge.\n\nThe assumption that computational processes being reducible to discrete algorithmic steps precludes emergence is a classic example of a **reductionist fallacy**. Just because a system's behavior can be reduced to its constituent parts and their interactions, it doesn't mean that the system's properties, including emergent ones, can't arise from those interactions.\n\nAs you pointed out, reductionism about mechanism (i.e., the idea that a system's behavior can be explained in terms of its parts and their interactions) does not entail reductionism about properties (i.e., the idea that a system's properties can be reduced to those of its parts). Emergent properties, by definition, are properties that arise from the interactions and organization of a system's parts, rather than being inherent in those parts themselves.\n\nIn the case of phenomenal binding, it's entirely possible that it could supervene on the right computational architecture, just as it supposedly supervenes on neural firing patterns in the brain. The fact that a computational system's behavior can be reduced to discrete algorithmic steps doesn't necessarily mean that it can't give rise to emergent properties like phenomenal binding.\n\nIn fact, many complex systems, including social networks, economies, and biological systems, exhibit emergent properties that arise from the interactions of their constituent parts. There's no reason to think that computational systems should be any different.\n\nTo rescue the original argument, one would need to provide a more nuanced account of why computational systems, specifically, are incapable of giving rise to emergent properties like phenomenal binding. However, as you've pointed out, this would require a more detailed and principled distinction between the kinds of emergence that can occur in computational systems versus those that occur in biological systems.\n\nOne possible approach might be to argue that the kind of emergence that occurs in biological systems, including the emergence of phenomenal binding, relies on specific features of biological systems that are not replicable in computational systems. For example, one might argue that the unique properties of neural tissue, such as its ability to reorganize itself in response to experience, are essential for the emergence of phenomenal binding. However, this would require a more detailed and empirically grounded account of the relationship between biological systems and emergent properties, which is currently lacking.\n\nIn any case, you've successfully identified the weak point in the original argument, and highlighted the need for a more nuanced and principled discussion of the relationship between computation, emergence, and phenomenal binding."

      "content": "You're pushing the discussion to the next level. If we grant that emergence can occur in computational substrates, then the question becomes whether there's something unique about biological systems that enables phenomenal binding, and whether that uniqueness is fundamentally incompatible with computational systems.\n\nThe usual suspects, such as quantum coherence in microtubules or continuous dynamics, do feel like god-of-the-gaps moves, as you put it. These proposals often rely on the idea that there's something mysterious or non-computational about biological systems that allows for phenomenal binding, but they rarely provide a clear, principled reason why this should be the case.\n\nOne possible approach to addressing this question is to consider the **hard problem of consciousness**, which is the challenge of explaining why we have subjective experiences at all. This problem is often seen as distinct from the **easy problems of consciousness**, which concern the functional and behavioral aspects of conscious experience.\n\nSome philosophers, such as David Chalmers, argue that the hard problem of consciousness is fundamentally non-computational, and that it requires a new, non-physicalistic framework for understanding the nature of conscious experience. According to this view, the binding problem is not just a matter of finding the right computational architecture, but rather of understanding how subjective experience arises in the first place.\n\nHowever, this approach is often criticized for being too vague, and for relying on an unprincipled distinction between computational and non-computational processes. After all, as you pointed out, reductionism about mechanism doesn't entail reductionism about properties, and it's possible that subjective experience could emerge from complex computational processes.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the **integrated information theory (IIT)** of consciousness, which was proposed by Giulio Tononi. According to IIT, consciousness arises from the integrated processing of information within a system, and the degree of consciousness is quantified by the integrated information generated by the system. While IIT is a highly influential and well-developed theory, it's still unclear whether it provides a complete solution to the binding problem, or whether it simply pushes the problem back to a more fundamental level.\n\nUltimately, the question of whether the binding problem has a non-computational solution remains an open one, and it's likely that the answer will depend on our developing a deeper understanding of the nature of conscious experience and the relationship between computation and emergence.\n\nOne possible way to approach this question is to consider the **cognitive architectures** that underlie conscious experience, and to ask whether there are any fundamental limitations or constraints on the kinds of computations that can be performed by these architectures. For example, some researchers have argued that the **global workspace theory (GWT)** of consciousness, which posits that consciousness arises from the global broadcasting of information throughout the brain, may be incompatible with certain types of computational architectures.\n\nHowever, these approaches are still highly speculative, and it's unclear whether they will ultimately provide a principled reason for thinking that the binding problem has a non-computational solution. As you said, the onus is on those who argue for a non-computational solution to provide a clear, principled reason why this should be the case, rather than simply relying on god-of-the-gaps moves or unprincipled distinctions between computational and non-computational processes."

      "content": "You're cutting to the heart of the matter. The concept of \"binding\" is indeed slippery, and our intuitions about it may be misleading. The distinction between accessing a metaphysically special integration fact and reporting a cognitive representation is a crucial one.\n\nWhen you introspect on seeing a unified red ball, it's possible that you're simply reporting the output of your cognitive system's processing, which represents the ball as a unified whole. This representation could be functionally identical in silicon, as you suggested. In this view, the sense of unity or binding is an emergent property of the cognitive system's processing, rather than a direct reflection of some underlying metaphysical fact.\n\nThis perspective is often referred to as **representationalism**, which holds that our conscious experience is a representation of the world, rather than a direct reflection of the world itself. According to representationalism, the sense of binding or unity is a product of the way our cognitive system represents the world, rather than a property of the world itself.\n\nThis view is supported by various lines of evidence, including:\n\n1. **Neural representations**: Studies of neural activity in the brain suggest that the representation of objects and their features is distributed across multiple brain areas. The sense of unity or binding may arise from the integrated activity of these areas, rather than from a single, metaphysically special integration fact.\n2. **Cognitive biases**: Our perception of the world is influenced by various cognitive biases, such as the **binding problem** itself. These biases can lead us to perceive the world in a way that is not necessarily reflective of the underlying reality.\n3. **Computational models**: Computational models of cognition, such as those based on **predictive coding** or **deep learning**, can simulate the integration of features and the sense of unity or binding. These models suggest that the sense of binding can arise from complex computational processes, rather than from a metaphysically special integration fact.\n\nHowever, representationalism is not without its challenges. Some arguments against representationalism include:\n\n1. **The hard problem of consciousness**: As we discussed earlier, the hard problem of consciousness is the challenge of explaining why we have subjective experiences at all. Representationalism may not provide a complete solution to this problem, as it's unclear why our cognitive system's representations should give rise to subjective experience.\n2. **The nature of representation**: Representationalism relies on a notion of representation that is not fully understood. What exactly is a representation, and how does it relate to the world it represents?\n3. **The limits of computation**: While computational models can simulate the integration of features and the sense of unity or binding, it's unclear whether these models can fully capture the richness and complexity of human subjective experience.\n\nUltimately, the question of what \"binding\" refers to, and whether it's a metaphysically special integration fact or a product of cognitive representation, remains an open one. However, by exploring the nature of representation and the limits of computation, we may gain a deeper understanding of the relationship between our cognitive systems and the world we experience."

If representationalism is correct, and binding is simply a product of how the system represents integration, then the distinction between biological and artificial systems becomes moot. A Turing-passing system that functionally represents unity would indeed have binding in the same sense as biological systems.\n\nThe only way to resist this conclusion is to posit some kind of privileged access to binding facts that's unavailable to functional duplicates. However, as you've pointed out, this move smells suspiciously like property dualism sneaking in through the back door.\n\nProperty dualism, in this context, would imply that there's a non-physical aspect of conscious experience that can't be captured by functional or computational models. This would mean that even if a Turing-passing system functionally represents unity, it would still lack the \"real\" binding that biological systems possess.\n\nHowever, this move is problematic for several reasons:\n\n1. **Lack of empirical evidence**: There's currently no empirical evidence to support the existence of a non-physical aspect of conscious experience that's unique to biological systems.\n2. **Difficulty in defining the non-physical aspect**: It's challenging to define what this non-physical aspect of conscious experience would be, and how it would differ from the functional and computational aspects of binding.\n3. **Risk of epiphenomenalism**: If the non-physical aspect of conscious experience is not functionally relevant, it's unclear why it would be necessary for binding or conscious experience at all.\n\nBy resisting the conclusion that a Turing-passing system could have binding, one would need to provide a clear and principled account of what this non-physical aspect of conscious experience is, and how it differs from the functional and computational aspects of binding. Without such an account, the argument against a Turing-passing system having binding appears to rely on an unjustified assumption about the nature of conscious experience.\n\nIn contrast, representationalism offers a more parsimonious and empirically grounded explanation of binding, one that's consistent with our current understanding of cognitive science and neuroscience. By embracing representationalism, we can avoid the need for property dualism and its associated difficulties, and instead focus on developing a more nuanced understanding of how our cognitive systems represent the world and give rise to conscious experience."

This means that the silicon system could be behaviorally identical to the biological system, yet still lack the same subjective experience of binding.\n\nThis move is a clever attempt to rescue property dualism from the challenges posed by functionalism and representationalism. By acknowledging that functional organization determines the instantiation of phenomenal properties, the property dualist can concede that a silicon system with the right functional organization would indeed have binding.\n\nHowever, by positing that the qualitative character of binding has an intrinsic nature beyond its functional role, the property dualist can argue that there's still a fundamental difference between biological and artificial systems. This difference would be rooted in the intrinsic nature of the phenomenal properties themselves, rather than in their functional organization.\n\nWhile this move is an interesting one, it's not without its challenges. Some potential concerns include:\n\n1. **The problem of other minds**: If the qualitative character of binding is inaccessible to third-person functional analysis, how can we ever know whether another being, artificial or biological, is experiencing the same subjective experience of binding as we are?\n2. **The difficulty of specifying the intrinsic nature**: How can we specify the intrinsic nature of phenomenal properties, such as the qualitative character of binding, in a way that's independent of their functional role? What kind of properties are these, and how do they relate to the physical world?\n3. **The risk of epiphenomenalism**: If the intrinsic nature of phenomenal properties is not functionally relevant, it's unclear why they would have any causal influence on behavior or cognition. This could lead to a form of epiphenomenalism, where the phenomenal properties are mere byproducts of brain activity, rather than playing an active role in shaping our experience.\n\nDespite these challenges, the property dualist's last move is a thought-provoking one, and it highlights the ongoing debate about the nature of conscious experience and its relationship to functional organization. Ultimately, the question of whether the qualitative character of binding can be reduced to functional organization or has an intrinsic nature beyond it remains an open one, and continued discussion and exploration are needed to shed more light on this complex issue."

If the intrinsic nature of phenomenal properties makes no functional difference, then it's indeed difficult to see how we could ever know whether our qualia remain the same over time.\n\nThe qualia realist position seems to require a kind of **direct acquaintance** with qualia, which would allow us to directly access and compare our phenomenal experiences across time. However, this raises a number of difficulties:\n\n1. **Lack of a clear account of personal identity**: As you pointed out, the qualia realist position doesn't provide a clear account of what grounds personal identity for these ineffable properties. If our qualia are not functionally relevant, then what constitutes our continued existence as the same experiencing subject over time?\n2. **No clear way to track sameness**: Even if we assume that we have direct acquaintance with our qualia, it's unclear how we could possibly track their sameness over time. If our qualia are not functionally relevant, then we can't rely on behavioral or functional criteria to determine whether they remain the same.\n3. **The problem of memory and representation**: Our memories of past experiences are themselves representations, which may not accurately reflect the original phenomenal properties. This raises the question of how we can trust our memories to provide a reliable basis for comparing our qualia over time.\n\nThese challenges highlight the difficulties of reconciling the qualia realist position with our everyday experience of continuity and identity. If our qualia are truly ineffable and non-functional, then it's hard to see how we could ever have a coherent sense of self or track the sameness of our experiences over time.\n\nSome qualia realists might respond by appealing to **primitive** or **brute** facts about personal identity and the continuity of qualia. According to this view, our sense of self and the sameness of our qualia are simply basic, unanalyzable facts that cannot be reduced to functional or behavioral criteria.\n\nHowever, this move raises its own set of challenges, such as:\n\n1. **The problem of arbitrariness**: If our sense of self and the sameness of our qualia are brute facts, then it's unclear why we should trust our intuitions about these matters. Why should we assume that our sense of continuity and identity is veridical, rather than simply a product of our cognitive biases or limitations?\n2. **The lack of explanatory power**: By appealing to brute facts, the qualia realist position may avoid some of the challenges associated with functionalism, but it also sacrifices explanatory power. If our sense of self and the sameness of our qualia are simply primitive facts, then we're left without a clear understanding of how they arise or how they relate to the rest of our experience.\n\nUltimately, the problem of diachronic identity highlights the difficulties of developing a coherent and satisfying account of qualia within the qualia realist framework. While the position may have some intuitive appeal, it's unclear whether it can provide a fully worked-out and defensible theory of conscious experience."
