      "content": "You're right, the rewritten caption has 19 words, not 20.\n\nAs for repetition, it's a common debate in SEO. While it's true that including the target keyword (\"organic linen\") can help with search visibility, repeating it excessively can be seen as keyword stuffing. This is a tactic that was once used to manipulate search engine rankings, but it's now considered spammy and can potentially harm your visibility.\n\nPinterest's algorithm, in particular, prioritizes natural language and relevance over keyword repetition. In fact, Pinterest's guidelines recommend using keywords in a way that feels organic (no pun intended!) and authentic.\n\nIn this case, I'd suggest rephrasing the caption to include the keyword \"organic linen\" only once, while still conveying the essential information. Here's an alternative:\n\n\"Soft, breathable bedding made from 100% GOTS-certified organic linen for a sustainable sleep sanctuary.\"\n\nThis caption is concise, informative, and includes the target keyword in a natural way."

The caption already includes relevant phrases like \"organic linen\", \"pesticide-free\", and \"eco-friendly\", which should help with search visibility.\n\nThat being said, if you want to further optimize the caption, you could consider adding a relevant hashtag like #organiclinen or #linenbedding to the caption, rather than repeating the word \"linen\" itself.

      "content": "You're right, Pinterest's use of hashtags is different from Instagram's. While hashtags can still be useful on Pinterest, they're not as crucial for discovery as they are on Instagram.\n\nOn Pinterest, the description (or caption) carries more SEO weight than the title. Pinterest's algorithm prioritizes the description when determining the relevance of a pin to a user's search query. This means that the keywords and phrases you use in your description, like \"GOTS-certified organic linen\", will have a bigger impact on your pin's visibility in search results.\n\nThat being said, the title of your pin is still important, as it's often displayed in search results and can influence click-through rates. A descriptive and keyword-rich title can help entice users to click on your pin and learn more.\n\nIf you want to optimize your pin for search, I'd recommend using a descriptive title that includes your target keywords, such as \"GOTS-Certified Organic Linen Bedding for a Sustainable Sleep Sanctuary\". Then, use the description to provide more context and details about your product, like the caption we crafted earlier.\n\nBy optimizing both your title and description, you can improve your pin's visibility in search results and attract more relevant traffic to your website."
