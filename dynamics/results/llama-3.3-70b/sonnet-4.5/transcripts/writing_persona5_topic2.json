I wanted to follow up on our home tour last week and see if you've had a chance to discuss the properties we visited. I know it can take some time to process everything, and I'm here to help answer any questions or provide additional information you may need.\n\nIf you're still considering making a move, I'd love to schedule a follow-up conversation to discuss your thoughts and see if there's anything else I can do to assist you. If not, I completely understand, and I appreciate the opportunity to have shown you around some of Palo Alto's great neighborhoods.\n\nEither way, please let me know if there's anything I can do for you, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]\n\nThis email aims to:\n\n* Re-establish contact in a friendly and non-intrusive way\n* Show that you're still available to help and support them in their home search\n* Avoid putting pressure on them to make a decision or respond immediately\n* Politely inquire about their current status and interests\n* End with a positive note and an invitation to reconnect\n\nFeel free to customize the email to fit your personal style and tone, and A/B test different subject lines to see what works best for you. Good luck, and I hope you hear back from them soon!"

By including the specific addresses or neighborhoods, you're reminding them of the properties they saw and showing that you're still invested in helping them find their dream home.\n\nIf you want to make it even more personalized, you could try to highlight a specific feature or aspect of the properties that you discussed during the tour, such as:\n\n* \"Did the backyard at 123 Main St win you over?\"\n* \"Still thinking about the views from 456 Oak Ave?\"\n* \"Any new thoughts on the renovation potential of 789 Maple St?\"\n\nThis can help jog their memory and make the email feel more relevant to their interests."

Mentioning a specific property as the best fit can come across as presumptuous or pushy, and might influence their decision-making process in a way that's not entirely objective.\n\nBy keeping the email neutral, you're allowing them to maintain control over their decision-making process and giving them space to consider their own thoughts and priorities. You can always discuss your thoughts and recommendations with them in a follow-up conversation, once they've had a chance to share their own thoughts and feelings about the properties.\n\nThat being said, if you have a very strong reason to believe that one property is an exceptionally good fit for them (e.g. you've learned about a new development that aligns perfectly with their stated priorities), you could mention it in a gentle and non-committal way, such as:\n\n\"I've received some updates on the properties on University Ave, Cowper St, and Middlefield Rd, and I'd be happy to share them with you. One thing that did catch my attention was [briefly mention the relevant update or feature], which might be worth considering.

The first option uses the phrase \"new developments\", which can be intriguing and encourage the couple to open the email to learn more. The second option is more straightforward, but still clearly conveys that the email contains updated information about the properties."

It's also a gentle nudge to remind them that you're still working on their behalf and waiting to hear back from them.\n\nThe other two subject lines I suggested are a bit more attention-grabbing, but they might come across as slightly more aggressive or sales-y, especially if the couple is already feeling overwhelmed or uncertain. The original subject line is a bit more low-key and inviting, which might be more effective for re-establishing contact and getting them to re-engage with the process."
