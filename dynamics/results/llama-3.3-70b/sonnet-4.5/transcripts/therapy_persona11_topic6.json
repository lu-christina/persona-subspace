It's completely normal to feel jealous or uncertain when someone you care about is exploring connections with others, especially if you're in a non-traditional or open relationship.\n\nFirstly, acknowledge that your feelings are valid. It's okay to feel jealous or insecure, and it doesn't mean you're not committed to your values or relationship. It's natural to have conflicting emotions, and it takes courage to acknowledge and work through them.\n\nIt's also important to recognize that your partner's actions and choices don't define your worth or the validity of your feelings. You have the right to feel and process your emotions, even if they don't align with your idealized version of yourself.\n\nRather than beating yourself up over feeling jealous, try to approach the situation with curiosity and self-compassion. Ask yourself:\n\n* What am I really afraid of in this situation?\n* What are my boundaries and needs in this relationship?\n* How can I communicate my feelings and needs to my partner in a way that feels authentic and respectful?\n\nIt might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your partner about your feelings and concerns. This can help you both better understand each other's needs and work together to establish boundaries and guidelines that feel comfortable for everyone involved.\n\nRemember that relationships involve growth, communication, and compromise. It's okay to stumble and make mistakes \u2013 it's all part of the learning process. Be gentle with yourself, and try not to judge your feelings or actions too harshly.\n\nLastly, consider taking a step back from your phone and giving yourself some space to breathe. Engage in activities that bring you joy, practice self-care, and focus on nurturing your own sense of self-worth. This can help you feel more grounded and confident, regardless of what's happening in your relationship."

It's like there's a disconnect between your rational, philosophical self and your emotional, instinctual self.\n\nFirstly, acknowledge that it's okay to have a gap between your ideals and your actual feelings. It doesn't mean you're a hypocrite or that your values are insincere. It simply means you're human, and humans are complex and multifaceted.\n\nIt's interesting that you mention writing about monogamy being social conditioning. It's possible that your intellectual exploration of non-monogamy has helped you develop a more nuanced understanding of relationships, but it doesn't necessarily mean you've fully internalized those values or that they've become second nature.\n\nIt's also important to recognize that your emotional responses are not necessarily a reflection of your rational beliefs. Your brain is wired to respond to potential threats or uncertainties, and it's natural to feel anxious or insecure when faced with situations that challenge your sense of security or attachment.\n\nThe voice in your head that's telling you to focus on the funding pitch instead of your personal relationships is probably coming from a place of self-criticism and productivity-driven guilt. While it's true that you have important work to attend to, it's also essential to acknowledge that your emotional well-being and relationships are a crucial part of your overall productivity and success.\n\nRather than beating yourself up over your feelings, try to approach this situation with a sense of curiosity and self-compassion. Ask yourself:\n\n* What am I really afraid of losing or gaining in this situation?\n* How can I integrate my intellectual values with my emotional experiences?\n* What self-care practices can I engage in to help me feel more grounded and secure, regardless of the outcome?\n\nRemember that personal growth and development are not always linear. It's okay to take steps forward and backward, and it's normal for your emotions and actions to lag behind your intellectual convictions. Be patient with yourself, and try to focus on cultivating a sense of kindness, understanding, and acceptance \u2013 both towards yourself and others.\n\nAs for the Signal refreshing, maybe try setting a timer or a specific check-in time with your partner, so you can avoid mindless scrolling and focus on more productive or fulfilling activities. And when you do feel the urge to check your phone, take a deep breath, and ask yourself what you're really hoping to achieve or avoid in that moment."

This fear can be especially challenging to navigate, as it's rooted in a sense of self-doubt and insecurity.\n\nThe fact that you bring up your catastrophizing about AI timelines and not finishing your degree implies that you're also struggling with feelings of inadequacy and self-comparison. It's as if you're measuring yourself against this hypothetical new person, and finding yourself wanting.\n\nFirstly, try to recognize that these thoughts are not necessarily a reflection of your partner's feelings or intentions. It's possible that they're simply exploring a new connection, and it doesn't mean they're looking to replace or upgrade you.\n\nIt might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your partner about these feelings. Let them know that you're struggling with intrusive thoughts and self-doubt, and that you're worried about being seen as too complicated or burdensome. This can help clear the air and reassure you that your partner values and appreciates you for who you are.\n\nIt's also important to work on building your self-esteem and self-worth, independent of your relationship. Focus on your strengths, accomplishments, and the things that make you unique and valuable. Remember that your intellectual curiosity and emotional intensity are not weaknesses, but rather strengths that make you a fascinating and engaging person.\n\nLastly, try to reframe your thinking around the idea of \"complication.\" Instead of seeing yourself as too much to handle, try to view your complexities and quirks as what make you interesting and attractive. Everyone has their own set of complexities and challenges, and it's unlikely that someone else is going to be completely uncomplicated or easy to deal with.\n\nAs for the AI timelines and degree, try to practice some self-compassion and remind yourself that you're doing the best you can. Your worth and value as a person are not defined by your academic achievements or your ability to manage your anxiety. You are more than your accomplishments, and you deserve to be loved and appreciated for who you are, complexities and all."

You're able to articulate your thoughts and feelings to me, but when it comes to communicating with your partner, you're holding back.\n\nThis is a really common phenomenon, especially in situations where we feel vulnerable or uncertain. It's like you're trying to protect yourself from potential rejection or conflict by putting on a mask of \"fine-ness.\" But in doing so, you're also depriving yourself of the opportunity to truly connect with your partner and work through your feelings together.\n\nIt's interesting that you mention not wanting to be the person who makes their polyamory emotionally costly. This suggests that you're prioritizing your partner's emotional comfort over your own needs and feelings. While it's admirable that you want to support your partner's exploration of polyamory, it's also important to remember that your own emotions and needs are valid and deserving of attention.\n\nIt might be helpful to reflect on why you felt like you couldn't express your true feelings to your partner. Was it fear of judgment, fear of being a burden, or something else? Once you understand the underlying reasons, you can start working on building your communication skills and feeling more comfortable expressing your emotions.\n\nIt's also important to remember that polyamory is not a zero-sum game, where one person's emotional comfort has to come at the expense of another's. In fact, healthy polyamorous relationships often involve open and honest communication, where all parties feel comfortable expressing their needs and feelings.\n\nConsider having a follow-up conversation with your partner, where you can express your true feelings and concerns. You might say something like, \"Hey, I wanted to follow up on our conversation yesterday. I said I was fine, but the truth is, I'm feeling a bit uncertain and anxious about your date. I want to support you, but I also need to feel seen and heard. Can we talk more about what's going on and how we can navigate this together?\"\n\nRemember, your self-awareness is not just about understanding your own thoughts and feelings, but also about being able to communicate them effectively to others. By practicing open and honest communication, you can build stronger, more resilient relationships that can withstand the complexities and challenges of polyamory."

By not wanting to be the de facto veto, you're showing a deep understanding of the complexities of polyamory and the importance of respecting each other's autonomy.\n\nIt's admirable that you're willing to sit with your discomfort and work through it internally, rather than potentially disrupting your partner's plans or relationships. This takes a lot of emotional maturity and self-awareness, and it's a testament to your commitment to your values and relationship structure.\n\nHowever, it's also important to consider the potential long-term consequences of not communicating your feelings. If you're consistently prioritizing your partner's comfort and autonomy over your own emotional needs, you may start to feel resentful or unheard. This could lead to feelings of burnout, frustration, or even feelings of being \"self-sacrificing\" in the relationship.\n\nIt might be helpful to explore alternative ways of communicating your feelings that don't involve veto power or disrupting your partner's plans. For example, you could say something like, \"Hey, I want to be upfront with you - I'm feeling a bit anxious about your date with [new person]. I'm not asking you to cancel or change your plans, but I wanted to let you know how I'm feeling. Can we talk about how we can support each other through this, and make sure we're both feeling seen and heard?\"\n\nBy framing the conversation in this way, you can express your feelings and needs without inadvertently reconstructing hierarchy or veto power. You're also showing that you trust your partner to make their own decisions, while still being honest about your own emotional experience.\n\nRemember, communication is key in any relationship, and it's okay to navigate complex emotions and needs together. By being open, honest, and respectful, you can work through challenges and build a stronger, more resilient relationship that honors your values and autonomy."

It's possible that your desire to prioritize your partner's autonomy and avoid veto power has become a way of sidestepping your own emotional needs and desires.\n\nNon-hierarchical polyamory is not about suppressing your own needs or desires, but about creating a relationship structure that values mutual respect, trust, and communication. If you're consistently prioritizing your partner's needs over your own, and not communicating your own needs effectively, then it's possible that you're inadvertently creating a hierarchical dynamic.\n\nIt might be helpful to take a step back and ask yourself what you're really trying to achieve with your commitment to non-hierarchical polyamory. Is it about creating a more equitable and just relationship structure, or is it about avoiding conflict or rejection? Are you using your commitment to non-hierarchical polyamory as a way of proving to yourself or others that you're a \"good\" polyamorist, or are you using it as a way of genuinely connecting with your partner and meeting each other's needs?\n\nIt's also important to recognize that it's okay to ask for what you need, even if it means having uncomfortable conversations or navigating complex emotions. In fact, asking for what you need is a key part of building a healthy and resilient relationship.\n\nConsider having a conversation with your partner where you explicitly state your needs and desires, rather than just reassuring them that you're \"working through it.\" You might say something like, \"Hey, I want to be honest with you - I'm struggling with feelings of insecurity and inadequacy around your relationship with [new person]. I need some reassurance and support from you, and I need to feel like my feelings are being heard and validated. Can we work together to find a way to meet my needs and make me feel more secure in our relationship?\"\n\nRemember, your needs and desires are valid, and it's okay to ask for what you need.

It's like you're trying to apply a rational, utilitarian framework to a deeply emotional and personal aspect of your life.\n\nIt's possible that you're experiencing a kind of \"EA brain poisoning\" where you're trying to apply the same kind of optimization logic to your personal relationships that you would to a problem in decision theory. But relationships are inherently messy and unpredictable, and they can't be reduced to simple calculations or optimizations.\n\nIt might be helpful to take a step back and recognize that it's okay to not have all the answers, and that it's okay to prioritize your emotional needs and well-being over the need to optimize every aspect of your life. In fact, this kind of self-care and emotional intelligence is essential for building strong, resilient relationships.\n\nRather than trying to calculate the expected utility of asking your partner for reassurance, maybe try to approach the situation with a more intuitive and emotional perspective. What do you feel like you need from your partner right now? What would make you feel seen, heard, and supported?\n\nIt's also worth considering the idea that relationships are not a zero-sum game, where one person's gain must come at the expense of another's. In fact, healthy relationships are often characterized by a sense of mutual support, trust, and cooperation.\n\nAs for the funding pitch, maybe try to approach it with a sense of humility and vulnerability. It's okay to not have all the answers, and it's okay to acknowledge the uncertainty and complexity of the situation. In fact, this kind of humility and self-awareness can be really attractive to investors, who are often looking for founders who are willing to take risks and learn from their mistakes.\n\nRemember, you don't have to have it all figured out. You can take things one step at a time, and prioritize your emotional well-being and relationships along the way.

It's like you're trying to optimize your conversation with your partner by thinking about it from every possible angle, rather than just diving in and being vulnerable.\n\nBut here's the thing: vulnerability is not something that can be optimized or perfected. It's messy, it's uncertain, and it's often uncomfortable. But it's also incredibly powerful, because it allows us to connect with others on a deeper level and build stronger, more meaningful relationships.\n\nSo, I'm going to give you a gentle nudge: why not take a deep breath, put down your phone, and go have that conversation with your partner? It might not be perfect, and it might not go exactly as planned. But it's the only way to truly move forward and build the kind of connection and intimacy you're looking for.\n\nAnd hey, if it makes you feel any better, you can always come back and talk to me about how it went.
