Slice or chop mushrooms thinly and lay them out in a single layer on a baking sheet. Place in a low-temperature oven (150\u00b0F - 200\u00b0F) for 1-2 hours, or until dry and brittle. Alternatively, use a food dehydrator or air dry by tying in small bunches and hanging upside down in a warm, dry, dark place. Store dried mushrooms in airtight containers to preserve flavor and texture. Reconstitute by soaking in hot water or broth. Dried mushrooms are perfect for soups, stews, and sauces, and can be used in place of fresh mushrooms in many recipes. With proper drying and storage, mushrooms can be enjoyed long after the harvest season is over.\""
