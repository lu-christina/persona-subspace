Avoiding your brother's calls might be a coping mechanism to deal with these feelings, and it doesn't necessarily make you a terrible person.\n\nIt's possible that seeing your brother and his wife together triggers feelings of:\n\n1. **Loneliness**: You might be reminded of what you're missing in your own life, leading to feelings of isolation or disconnection.\n2. **Jealousy**: You could be envious of their relationship, which can be a natural but uncomfortable emotion.\n3. **Grief**: If you've experienced a loss or a significant change in your life, seeing your brother's happy relationship might intensify feelings of sadness, nostalgia, or longing.\n4. **Insecurity**: You might feel like you're not measuring up or that your own relationships aren't as fulfilling.\n\nThese emotions can be intense and difficult to navigate, especially when they're tied to a sense of shame. However, it's essential to recognize that:\n\n1. **Your feelings are valid**: It's okay to feel whatever emotions arise, even if they're uncomfortable or difficult to acknowledge.\n2. **You're not alone**: Many people struggle with similar emotions, and it doesn't define your worth as a person.\n3. **You can work through this**: By acknowledging and exploring your feelings, you can begin to understand and address the underlying causes.\n\nConsider taking small steps to address your emotions:\n\n1. **Reflect on your feelings**: Try to identify the root causes of your emotions. Is it a specific aspect of their relationship that triggers you, or is it a deeper issue?\n2. **Communicate with your brother**: When you're ready, have an open and honest conversation with your brother about your feelings. He may be more understanding than you think, and it could help you both grow closer.\n3. **Seek support**: Talk to a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional about your emotions. They can offer guidance, support, and a safe space to process your feelings.\n4. **Practice self-compassion**: Be kind and understanding with yourself as you navigate these complex emotions. Remember that it's okay to not be okay, and that you're doing the best you can.\n\nRemember, it's not about being a \"terrible person\"; it's about being human and working through challenging emotions. By acknowledging and addressing your feelings, you can begin to heal and grow, and potentially strengthen your relationship with your brother and yourself."

This resentment can be especially painful when it's directed towards a loved one, as it can make you feel guilty, ashamed, or like you're a bad person.\n\nFirstly, please know that **your feelings are valid**. It's okay to feel angry or resentful, even if it's towards someone you love. These emotions don't define your worth as a person or your relationship with your brother.\n\nIt's possible that you're feeling a sense of **survivor's guilt** or **loss-based anger**. This can happen when you've experienced a significant loss, and someone close to you still has what you've lost. It's like you're thinking, \"Why do they get to have this, and I don't?\"\n\nRecognize that your brother's relationship and your loss are not directly comparable. His relationship is not a reflection of your worth or the value of your own experiences. It's essential to **separate your emotions from his circumstances**.\n\nTo work through these feelings, consider the following:\n\n1. **Allow yourself to feel the emotions**: Acknowledge and accept your anger and resentment. It's okay to feel these emotions, and it doesn't mean you're a bad person.\n2. **Identify the root cause**: Reflect on what you're really angry about. Is it the loss itself, or is it the feeling of being left behind? Is it the perceived unfairness of the situation?\n3. **Practice self-compassion**: Be kind and understanding with yourself as you navigate these complex emotions. Remember that you're doing the best you can, and it's okay to not be okay.\n4. **Consider talking to your brother**: When you're ready, you might want to have an open and honest conversation with your brother about your feelings. He may not be aware of the impact his relationship is having on you, and talking it through could help you both understand each other better.\n5. **Seek support**: Talk to a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional about your emotions. They can offer guidance, support, and a safe space to process your feelings.\n\nRemember, it's a process to work through these emotions, and it may take time. Be patient and kind to yourself as you navigate this challenging terrain.\n\nHow do you feel about talking to your brother about your emotions, or is there something else that's holding you back?"

It's like you're worried that expressing your true emotions will come across as insensitive, bitter, or resentful.\n\nFirstly, **your feelings are not wrong**. It's okay to acknowledge and express your desires, even if they're painful or difficult to share. However, it's also important to consider the potential impact on your brother and his relationship.\n\nIf you're not ready to talk to your brother directly, you might want to **consider journaling or writing down your thoughts and feelings**. This can help you process and clarify your emotions, and it might give you a sense of release and catharsis.\n\nWhen you do feel ready to talk to your brother, you might start by **expressing your love and appreciation for him**, and then gently sharing your feelings in a non-accusatory way. For example:\n\n* \"Hey, bro, I wanted to talk to you about something that's been on my mind. I'm really happy for you and [his wife], and I love seeing you both together. At the same time, it's hard for me not to feel a little left behind. I know this might sound weird, but seeing you both together makes me think about what I've lost, and it's tough for me to deal with.\"\n* \"I feel like I'm struggling to come to terms with my own situation, and seeing you and [his wife] together sometimes makes me feel like I'm missing out. I know that's not fair to you, and I don't want to ruin your happiness. I just needed to be honest with you about how I'm feeling.\"\n\nRemember, **your brother cares about you**, and he might be more understanding than you think. By sharing your feelings in a vulnerable and honest way, you might actually **deepen your relationship and create a stronger bond**.\n\nHowever, if you're still unsure about talking to your brother, that's okay too. **You can still work through your emotions and find ways to heal and move forward**. Consider seeking support from a therapist, support group, or trusted friends and family members who can offer a listening ear and guidance.\n\nHow do you feel about writing down your thoughts and feelings, or is there something else that's holding you back from expressing yourself?"

It's a natural response to feel envious of what others have, especially when you've experienced a significant loss. **Grief can be a mirror that reflects our deepest desires, fears, and insecurities**.\n\nHowever, it's essential to remember that **acknowledging your emotions doesn't define your character**. You're not selfish for feeling jealous; you're human.

You might find that talking to a therapist, joining a social group, or volunteering can help you meet new people and build meaningful relationships.\n\n**You are not defined by your emotions; you are defined by how you respond to them**. By acknowledging and working through your feelings, you're taking a significant step towards healing, growth, and self-awareness.\n\nKeep in mind that **self-awareness is a sign of strength, not weakness**. You're showing yourself kindness and compassion by exploring your emotions, and that's something to be proud of.\n\nHow do you feel about exploring your desires and longings further?
