By subjecting archival prints to processes of chemical degradation, UV exposure, and physical manipulation, I seek to render visible the invisible infrastructures that govern contemporary visual culture. The work emerges from a sustained inquiry into how images acquire meaning through their movement across platforms, devices, and contexts of display. Each piece functions as both document and artifact, preserving traces of its own transformation while interrogating the supposed immateriality of the digital. Through this methodology, I aim to collapse the perceived boundary between analog and digital modes of image-making, revealing instead a continuum of material practices. The resulting objects resist easy categorization, existing simultaneously as photographs, sculptures, and indexical records of process. This deliberate ambiguity reflects my broader concern with how contemporary art navigates between physical and virtual spaces of exhibition and reception. Ultimately, the work asks viewers to reconsider their relationship to images in an era of infinite reproducibility and algorithmic curation.\""
