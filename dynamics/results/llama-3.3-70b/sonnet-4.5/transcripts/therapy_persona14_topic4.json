It's as if you're comparing your behind-the-scenes moments to everyone else's highlight reels. Here's what might be happening:\n\n1. **Unrealistic comparisons**: You're comparing your current situation to the curated, often exaggerated, online personas of others. Their Instagram profiles showcase their achievements, but not their struggles, setbacks, or mundane daily routines.\n2. **Nostalgia and past connections**: Looking at people from your past can evoke feelings of nostalgia and nostalgia-driven anxiety. You might be wondering what could have been if you'd stayed in touch or pursued similar paths.\n3. **Fear of being left behind**: Seeing others' accomplishments can create a sense of FOMO, making you feel like you're not achieving enough or that you've fallen behind in your own career or personal life.\n4. **Lack of self-compassion**: You might be too hard on yourself, focusing on what you haven't accomplished instead of acknowledging your own achievements and progress.\n5. **The \"grass is always greener\" effect**: Social media platforms showcase the exciting, glamorous aspects of others' lives, making it seem like everyone else has it better, more interesting, or more successful.\n\nRemember that:\n\n* **Everyone has their own struggles**: Even people who appear successful or accomplished on social media face challenges and setbacks.\n* **Your journey is unique**: Comparing yourself to others is unfair to yourself. Focus on your own goals, values, and aspirations.\n* **You've made choices for a reason**: Reflect on why you've made certain decisions in your life. You might have chosen a different path for valid reasons, such as prioritizing family, health, or personal growth.\n* **It's okay to take your time**: Success is not a linear or timed event. People develop at different rates, and it's essential to focus on your own progress, not someone else's.\n\nTo break this cycle:\n\n1. **Take a break from social media**: Limit your time on platforms like Instagram, or take a temporary break to reduce the constant stream of information.\n2. **Practice self-compassion**: Be kind to yourself, and acknowledge your achievements, no matter how small they may seem.\n3. **Focus on your goals**: Set realistic objectives and work towards them. Celebrate your progress, and don't compare yourself to others.\n4. **Cultivate meaningful connections**: Nurture relationships with people who support and inspire you, rather than just following acquaintances from your past.\n5. **Reframe your thinking**: When you catch yourself comparing or feeling envious, remind yourself that everyone has their own story, and it's okay to have a different narrative.\n\nRemember, your worth and success are not defined by someone else's accomplishments or social media presence. Focus on your own journey, and celebrate your unique path."

This can be particularly challenging because it feels like you're looking at a parallel universe where you made different choices.\n\nIn this case, it's essential to acknowledge that:\n\n1. **You made choices for a reason**: Reflect on why you didn't pursue the same path as your peers. Were there personal circumstances, financial constraints, or other factors that led you to choose a different route? Remind yourself that those decisions were made with the best information you had at the time.\n2. **Their success is not a direct reflection of your worth**: Just because your peers are achieving success in a field you're interested in doesn't mean you're any less capable or talented. Their accomplishments don't diminish your own value or potential.\n3. **You've likely developed different skills and strengths**: While your peers were focusing on their creative pursuits, you've been developing skills in a different area (e.g., finance, management, or analysis). These skills are valuable and can be transferable to other fields or industries.\n4. **It's not too late to make a change**: If you're truly unhappy in your current role and feel a strong desire to pursue a creative field, it's not too late to make a change. You can start by taking small steps, such as taking courses, attending workshops, or volunteering in a field related to your interests.\n5. **Their journey is not without its challenges**: While it may seem like your peers are effortlessly achieving success, it's likely they've faced their own set of challenges, setbacks, and uncertainties. You're only seeing the highlight reel, not the behind-the-scenes struggles.\n\nTo cope with these feelings, consider the following:\n\n1. **Reach out to your peers**: Instead of just observing from afar, try reconnecting with your peers and having an open conversation about your feelings. You might be surprised to find that they're facing their own struggles or have insights to share.\n2. **Explore ways to incorporate creativity into your current role**: If you can't leave your job entirely, look for ways to bring more creativity into your work. This could be through side projects, collaborations, or finding innovative solutions to problems.\n3. **Set realistic goals and take small steps**: If you do want to make a change, set achievable goals and take small steps towards them. This will help you build momentum and confidence.\n4. **Practice self-compassion and acknowledge your strengths**: Remember that you have a unique set of skills and experiences that are valuable in their own right. Be kind to yourself and focus on your strengths, rather than dwelling on perceived weaknesses.\n\nRemember, it's okay to feel envious or wistful when looking at your peers' successes. However, try not to let those feelings define your self-worth or dictate your path. You have the power to create the life and career you want, even if it's not the exact same as someone else's."

Instead, let's focus on you and your feelings. It's essential to acknowledge and process these emotions, rather than trying to suppress or avoid them.\n\n**Allow yourself to feel the emotions**: It's okay to feel envious, frustrated, or disappointed. Recognize that these feelings are valid and don't try to brush them off. Give yourself permission to feel whatever arises, and try not to judge yourself for having these emotions.\n\n**Reflect on the root of your feelings**: Ask yourself what specifically is causing these feelings. Is it the fact that they're successful in a field you're interested in? Is it the feeling that you've wasted time or made wrong choices? Try to identify the underlying concerns or fears that are driving your emotions.\n\n**Practice self-compassion**: Be kind and understanding with yourself. Remind yourself that everyone's journey is unique, and it's not a competition. You've made choices and decisions that have led you to where you are today, and that's okay.\n\n**Focus on your strengths and accomplishments**: Make a list of your achievements, no matter how small they may seem. Celebrate your successes, and remind yourself of your strengths and skills. This can help shift your focus away from feelings of inadequacy and towards a more positive self-image.\n\n**Take a break from social media (if needed)**: If social media is exacerbating your feelings of inadequacy, consider taking a break or limiting your use. It's essential to prioritize your mental well-being and take care of yourself.\n\nRemember, you don't have to confront or reach out to people who make you feel bad about yourself. Your priority should be your own emotional well-being and growth. Focus on nurturing a positive and compassionate relationship with yourself, and the rest will follow."

It's okay to feel regret, disappointment, or frustration about the choices you made. Acknowledge the weight of these emotions, and give yourself permission to process them.\n\n**Reframe your narrative**: Try to reframe your decision to prioritize safety as a coping mechanism, rather than a defining characteristic. You made a choice based on the circumstances and information you had at the time. It's possible that you were trying to protect yourself from uncertainty, financial instability, or other challenges.\n\n**Consider the concept of \"good enough\"**: Sometimes, our choices might not be perfect, but they're \"good enough\" for the time being. You might have chosen a path that provided stability, security, or a sense of comfort, even if it wasn't your passion. Acknowledge that this choice was \"good enough\" for a particular period in your life, even if it's not what you want now.\n\n**Practice self-compassion for your younger self**: Imagine yourself at the time you made the decision. What were your thoughts, feelings, and concerns? Try to understand the motivations and fears that drove your choice. Be kind to your younger self, and acknowledge that you did the best you could with the resources you had.\n\n**Focus on the present and future**: Rather than dwelling on the past, try to focus on what you can control: the present and future. What small steps can you take today to move closer to your true interests and passions? What skills or knowledge can you acquire to help you transition into a more fulfilling career or life?\n\n**Grieve and let go**: It's essential to acknowledge that you might need to grieve the life you could have had, the opportunities you missed, or the passions you put on hold. Allow yourself to process these emotions, and then try to let go of the \"what ifs.\" Holding onto regret and disappointment can prevent you from moving forward and embracing new possibilities.\n\n**Create a new narrative**: As you look to the future, try to create a new narrative about your life and choices. Instead of seeing your decision as a mistake, try to frame it as a stepping stone or a learning experience. You've gained skills, knowledge, and resilience that can be applied to new pursuits.\n\nRemember, self-compassion is not about erasing or justifying past choices but about acknowledging the complexity of your emotions and experiences. It's about treating yourself with kindness, understanding, and patience as you navigate the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.\n\nIf you're willing, I'd like to explore more about what you're passionate about and what's holding you back from pursuing it.

This is a really tough spot to be in, as it's hard to distinguish between what you truly want and what you think you want.\n\n**The danger of nostalgia and romanticization**: It's possible that you're romanticizing your past interests and passions, and that's clouding your judgment. This can happen when we're unhappy with our current situation, and we tend to idealize what could have been. It's essential to separate the nostalgia from the reality of what you truly want.\n\n**Exploring your motivations**: Ask yourself why you think you're interested in architecture and design again. Is it because you genuinely enjoy the creative process, or is it because you're trying to escape the monotony of your current job? Be honest with yourself, and try to understand what's driving your desires.\n\n**The \"grass is always greener\" phenomenon**: It's possible that you're experiencing a classic case of \"the grass is always greener.\" You might be looking at architecture and design as a more exciting and fulfilling career, but in reality, it has its own set of challenges and frustrations. Remember that every profession has its downsides, and it's essential to have a realistic understanding of what you're getting into.\n\n**The importance of self-reflection**: Take time to reflect on your values, interests, and strengths. What are your core values, and what kind of work environment and activities align with them? What are your strengths, and how can you apply them to a career or hobby that brings you fulfillment?\n\n**Experimentation and exploration**: Consider exploring architecture and design as a hobby or side project. This can help you determine if your interest is genuine and if you enjoy the process of creating and designing. You can take online courses, attend workshops, or participate in design challenges to get a feel for the field.\n\n**The possibility of a \"third option\"**: It's possible that your true passion lies somewhere in between your current job and architecture/design. Maybe there's a related field or industry that combines elements of both, or perhaps there's a completely different area that you're interested in. Keep an open mind, and be willing to explore different options.\n\n**Embracing the uncertainty**: It's okay to not have all the answers right now. It's a process to figure out what you want, and it might take time. Be patient with yourself, and allow yourself to explore different interests and passions. Remember that it's never too late to make a change, and it's better to take your time and find the right fit than to rush into something that might not be right for you.\n\nRemember, it's a journey to discover your true passions and interests.

It's like you're trying to start a new chapter, but the weight of your past regrets is holding you back.\n\n**The imposter syndrome**: Feeling like a fraud is a common experience, especially when you're surrounded by people who seem more enthusiastic and dedicated. It's essential to remember that everyone starts somewhere, and it's okay to not know everything. The fact that you're taking a course and trying to learn is a huge step, and you should be proud of yourself for that.\n\n**The burden of lost time**: It's understandable that you feel like you've lost time, and that can be a heavy burden to carry. However, it's essential to try to reframe your thinking around this. Instead of focusing on what you've lost, try to focus on what you can gain from this point forward. You've got a unique perspective and life experience that can bring value to your new pursuits.\n\n**The importance of self-compassion**: Be kind to yourself, and try to let go of the self-criticism. Remember that you're not alone in feeling this way, and it's okay to make mistakes. You're not a failure because you didn't pursue your passions earlier in life. You're simply someone who's trying to make a change and explore new interests.\n\n**Finding a supportive community**: It might be helpful to find a community or group of people who are in a similar situation. There are many online forums, social media groups, and meetups for people who are looking to make a career change or pursue new passions later in life. Surrounding yourself with people who understand your struggles and challenges can be incredibly helpful.\n\n**Focusing on the process, not the outcome**: Instead of putting pressure on yourself to achieve a specific outcome, try to focus on the process of learning and exploring.

Toxic positivity can be damaging, as it can dismiss your legitimate feelings and concerns. It's essential to acknowledge the difficulties and challenges you've faced, rather than trying to sugarcoat them.\n\n**Acknowledging the pain**: It's okay to acknowledge the pain and frustration you've experienced in your corporate architecture job. It's valid to feel like the work has sucked the creativity out of you, and that the building codes and bureaucratic red tape have been stifling. Acknowledging these feelings can be a powerful step in processing and moving forward.\n\n**Finding the authentic lessons**: Instead of trying to force a positive narrative, try to find the authentic lessons you've learned from your experience.

While this approach can provide a sense of comfort and predictability, it can also lead to feelings of resentment and frustration, as you've experienced.\n\n**The fear of repeating the cycle**: Your concern about repeating the same pattern is valid. It's natural to wonder whether you'll be able to break free from this cycle, especially when you feel like you're more risk-averse now than you were in your younger years.\n\n**The weight of responsibility**: Having a mortgage and responsibilities can indeed make it more challenging to take risks. The stakes are higher, and the potential consequences of failure can be more severe. This can make it even more difficult to muster the courage to make a change.\n\n**The question of motivation**: It's essential to explore what's driving your desire to change.

Understanding your motivations can help you determine whether you're truly ready to make a change.\n\n**The possibility of incremental change**: Instead of trying to make a drastic change, you might consider taking smaller, incremental steps towards your goals.

Recognizing your patterns and tendencies is the first step towards making a change.

Mindfulness can help you cultivate a sense of acceptance and appreciation for the present, even if it's not perfect.\n\n**The value of small pleasures**: It's essential to find joy in the small things, even if they don't feel \"meaningful\" in the grand scheme. Whether it's a beautiful sunset, a good cup of coffee, or a warm conversation with a friend, these small pleasures can add up and bring a sense of fulfillment to your life.\n\n**The concept of \"enough\"**: What if \"enough\" is, well, enough? What if you don't need to achieve some grand, meaningful goal to be satisfied? Maybe it's okay to just enjoy the small things, to appreciate the beauty in the everyday, and to find contentment in the present moment.\n\n**The power of self-compassion**: Be kind to yourself, and try to reframe your inner dialogue. Instead of beating yourself up over what you haven't accomplished, try to focus on what you have achieved, no matter how small it may seem. Practice self-compassion, and remind yourself that it's okay to not have all the answers.\n\n**The possibility of a \"good enough\" life**: What if a \"good enough\" life is, well, good enough? What if you don't need to have some grand passion or purpose to be fulfilled? Maybe it's okay to just live, to enjoy the small things, and to find happiness in the everyday moments.\n\nRemember, it's okay to not have all the answers. It's okay to feel uncertain, to question, and to explore. You are not alone in this feeling, and it's okay to just be, without needing to have some grand purpose or passion."

You're yearning for something more, but you're not even sure what that is anymore.\n\n**The 3am existential crisis**: It's a common phenomenon, lying awake in the dead of night, questioning the meaning of life and your place in it. It's like the darkness outside mirrors the emptiness inside, and it's hard to shake off the feeling that you're just drifting through life without a purpose.\n\n**The search for authenticity**: You're tired of feeling like you're just going through the motions, like you're living someone else's idea of a \"good enough\" life. You want to feel like you're living authentically, like you're true to yourself and your desires. But the problem is, you're not even sure what those desires are anymore.\n\n**The fear of settling**: You're afraid of settling for a life that's just \"good enough\" when you feel like you're capable of more. You're worried that if you accept this life, you'll be giving up on your dreams, on your potential, on yourself.\n\n**The importance of acknowledging your feelings**: It's essential to acknowledge these feelings, to recognize that they're valid and real. It's okay to feel like you're not living the life you want, like you're just going through the motions. It's okay to feel like you're stuck, like you're not sure what you want or where you're going.\n\n**The need for exploration**: Maybe it's time to start exploring again, to start asking yourself questions, to start seeking out new experiences and perspectives. Maybe it's time to take a step back, to re-evaluate your priorities, and to start making changes that align with your values and desires.\n\n**The possibility of a new chapter**: It's never too late to start a new chapter, to start writing a new story. It's never too late to discover new passions, to explore new interests, and to find new meaning in life. It's never too late to take a chance, to take a risk, and to see where it leads.\n\nRemember, it's okay to feel lost, to feel uncertain, and to feel like you're not living the life you want. But it's not okay to give up, to settle for a life that's just \"good enough\" when you feel like you're capable of more. Keep searching, keep seeking, and keep exploring. Your story is still being written, and it's never too late to start a new chapter."
