      "content": "Writing a culturally sensitive and inclusive year-end thank-you letter can be a challenge. Here's a suggestion on how to incorporate the red envelope promotion and a lucky idiom in a way that's respectful and considerate of your non-Chinese clients:\n\n**Option 1: Explain the cultural context**\n\nYou could start by explaining the cultural significance of Chinese New Year and the tradition of giving red envelopes (hongbao) as a symbol of good luck and prosperity. This way, you're educating your non-Chinese clients about the cultural context and making them feel included.\n\nExample:\n\"As we approach the Lunar New Year, we want to take a moment to express our gratitude for your trust and partnership. In many Asian cultures, the Lunar New Year is a time for renewal and new beginnings. To celebrate, it's traditional to give red envelopes filled with lucky money to wish loved ones good fortune and prosperity. We'd like to extend this tradition to you, our valued clients, with a special red envelope promotion [insert details]. As we say in Chinese, 'Gong Xi Fa Cai' (, which means 'wishing you prosperity and good fortune'). We hope this special offer brings you joy and success in the coming year.\"\n\n**Option 2: Use a universal message with a touch of cultural flair**\n\nAlternatively, you could focus on a universal message of appreciation and gratitude, while still incorporating a subtle nod to the Chinese New Year tradition.\n\nExample:\n\"As we close out the year, we want to thank you for being an important part of our journey. We're excited to embark on a new year filled with possibilities and opportunities. To celebrate, we're offering a special red envelope promotion [insert details] as a token of our appreciation. May the coming year bring you 'yi qi shun li' (, or 'smooth sailing and success'), and may our partnership continue to flourish.\"\n\n**Option 3: Omit the idiom, focus on the promotion**\n\nIf you're still unsure about using a Chinese idiom, you could simply focus on the promotion and the appreciation message, without referencing the cultural context.\n\nExample:\n\"As a valued client, we're grateful for your trust and partnership. To show our appreciation, we're offering a special red envelope promotion [insert details] to help you kick-start the new year. We're excited to continue working with you and exploring new opportunities together.\"\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to be sincere and genuine in your appreciation message. Your clients will appreciate the thought and effort you put into the letter, regardless of the cultural references."

In our culture, it's customary to give red envelopes filled with lucky money to wish loved ones prosperity and success. We'd like to extend this tradition to you, our valued clients, with a special red envelope promotion [insert details]. Wishing you 'Gong Xi Fa Cai' - prosperity and good fortune in the coming year!\"\n\nThis version still conveys the cultural context, but in a more concise and conversational way. It focuses on sharing a nice tradition with your clients, rather than explaining it in detail. The tone is friendly and inclusive, and the language is simple and easy to understand.\n\nAlternatively, you could also try:\n\n\"As we ring in the Lunar New Year, we're excited to share a special tradition with you. We're offering a red envelope promotion [insert details] to wish you prosperity and good fortune, just like we do with our loved ones. Gong Xi Fa Cai, and thank you for being an important part of our year!\"\n\nThis version is even shorter and more casual, and it gets straight to the point. It still conveys the cultural context and the appreciation, but in a very concise and friendly way."

We're offering a red envelope promotion [insert details] to wish you prosperity and good fortune, just like we do with our loved ones. Gong Xi Fa Cai, and thank you for being an important part of our year!\"\n\nRegarding the red envelope amount, it's a good idea to be clear about what the offer entails. You could say something like:\n\n* \"We're offering a red envelope with a $X credit towards your next purchase\"\n* \"Our red envelope promotion includes a special discount of X% off your next order\"\n* \"We're giving you a red envelope with a complimentary [service/product] valued at $X\"\n\nThis way, your clients know exactly what to expect and can appreciate the value of the offer.\n\nAlternatively, if you want to keep the language more general, you could say:\n\n* \"We're offering a special red envelope gift to help you start the new year off right\"\n* \"Our red envelope promotion includes a exclusive offer, just for our valued clients\"\n* \"We're sending you a red envelope with a surprise gift to show our appreciation\"\n\nThis approach can create a sense of excitement and anticipation, but make sure you're not being too vague or misleading. You want to ensure that your clients understand the value and significance of the offer."

The offer \"$888 off closing costs for any referral that closes in Q1\" is clear, specific, and relevant to your real estate business.\n\nWhile it may be a bit gimmicky, it's a thoughtful and culturally sensitive gesture that shows you're making an effort to connect with your clients and celebrate the Lunar New Year. The fact that you're offering a tangible benefit ($888 off closing costs) makes it a valuable and appealing incentive.\n\nTo make it even more effective, you could consider adding a brief explanation of why you chose the number 8, to add a personal touch and highlight the cultural significance. For example:\n\n\"As we celebrate the Lunar New Year, we're excited to share a special offer with you. In Chinese culture, the number 8 is considered lucky, symbolizing prosperity and good fortune. To wish you and your loved ones a prosperous new year, we're offering $888 off closing costs for any referral that closes in Q1.

While it's great that you're trying to be culturally sensitive and inclusive, you also want to make sure that all your clients feel valued and included.\n\nTo mitigate this risk, you could consider a few things:\n\n1. **Keep the language inclusive**: Make sure the language you use is welcoming and inclusive, and that you're not assuming that all your clients are familiar with Chinese culture. Use phrases like \"we're celebrating the Lunar New Year\" instead of \"we're celebrating Chinese New Year\" to make it more universal.\n2. **Focus on the universal theme**: Emphasize the universal theme of new beginnings, prosperity, and good fortune, which is relevant to people from all cultural backgrounds. You could say something like \"As we start a new year, we want to wish you prosperity and good fortune, and express our gratitude for your business.\"\n3. **Use a gentle touch**: Don't overdo it with the cultural references. A simple mention of the Lunar New Year and the lucky number 8 is enough. You don't need to go into great detail or use overly elaborate language.\n4. **Make it about the client**: Remember that the letter is ultimately about your clients and your appreciation for their business. Make sure the focus is on them, and that the cultural reference is just a nice added touch.\n\nHere's an example of how you could revise the letter to make it more inclusive:\n\n\"As we start a new year, we want to take a moment to express our gratitude for your trust and partnership. We're excited to celebrate the Lunar New Year, a time of new beginnings and fresh opportunities. To wish you prosperity and good fortune, we're offering $888 off closing costs for any referral that closes in Q1. Thank you for being an important part of our year, and we look forward to continuing to work with you in the years to come.\"\n\nThis way, you're still acknowledging the Lunar New Year and the cultural significance of the number 8, but you're also making it clear that the letter is about your clients and your appreciation for their business."

Here are a few options:\n\n1. **Use the idiom in a sentence, without translation**: You could say something like \"We hope our partnership will bring you \u5e74\u5e74\u6709\u4f59 in the years to come.\" This approach assumes that some clients will be familiar with the phrase, while others may not. However, the context of the sentence should give them a general idea of the meaning.\n2. **Use a subtle translation or explanation**: Instead of translating the idiom directly, you could use a phrase that conveys the same meaning in a more subtle way. For example, \"We wish you a year filled with abundance and prosperity, where every year brings more than the last.\" This approach still conveys the idea behind the idiom, without explicitly translating it.\n3. **Use the idiom as a closing phrase, without translation**: You could end your letter with a simple \"\u5e74\u5e74\u6709\u4f59\" without translation. This approach is more common in Chinese business culture, where the phrase is often used as a way to wish someone well. Non-Chinese clients may not understand the exact meaning, but they'll likely appreciate the cultural gesture.\n\nUltimately, the key is to use the idiom in a way that feels natural and authentic to your brand and relationship with your clients. If you're unsure, you could always test the language with a small group of clients or colleagues to see how it's received."
