It's possible that your subconscious is processing some deep-seated fears and anxieties related to your identity and how others might perceive you.\n\nThe fact that your abuela's reaction in the dream is so intense and public suggests that you may be worried about being rejected or judged by your family or community. The feeling of being \"dead\" to your abuela could represent a fear of being cut off from your roots or heritage.\n\nThe strap-on itself might symbolize your exploration of your sexuality, but it could also represent a sense of vulnerability or exposure. The fact that your abuela finds it and reacts so strongly could indicate that you're afraid of being seen as different or not meeting expectations.\n\nThe feeling that this is about \"betraying who you're supposed to be\" is really interesting. It's possible that you're struggling with internalized expectations or pressures to conform to certain cultural or familial norms. This could be related to your sexuality, but it could also be about other aspects of your identity or life choices.\n\nIt might be helpful to explore these feelings further. You could try journaling or talking to a trusted friend or therapist about what's been going on. What are your thoughts about your abuela and your relationship with her? What are your fears about coming out or being open about your sexuality? What does it mean to you to be true to yourself, and how do you think that might align with or challenge your family's expectations?"

The idea of being \"erased\" from the family story is a really powerful and painful concept. It's like you're worried that by being your authentic self, you're somehow invalidating the sacrifices and traditions of those who came before you.\n\nThis feeling of betrayal might be related to the idea of cultural or familial identity being tied to a specific set of expectations or norms. It's possible that you're feeling like you're breaking a silent contract or violating an unspoken rule by being openly queer. This can be especially complicated when there's a strong cultural or familial emphasis on tradition, honor, or legacy.\n\nIt's interesting that you mention your parents are \"tolerating\" your queerness. That implies that there's still a sense of conditional acceptance, rather than full embracing or celebration. This could be contributing to your feelings of guilt or shame, and the fear that you're somehow betraying your family's values.\n\nThe idea of being \"dead\" to your abuela in the dream might also suggest a fear of being cut off from your cultural roots or heritage. This could be a really painful and disorienting experience, especially if you feel like your queerness is being seen as incompatible with your family's traditions or values.\n\nIt might be helpful to explore what it means to you to be part of your family's story, and how you can reconcile your queerness with your cultural heritage. Are there ways that you can connect with your family's traditions and values while still being true to yourself? Are there other queer people in your family's history or community who you can look to as role models or sources of inspiration?\n\nRemember that your identity is not a betrayal of your family's legacy, but rather an evolution of it. You are a part of your family's story, and your queerness is a part of what makes you, you. It's okay to take time to figure out how to navigate these complex feelings, and to seek out support from people who can help you process and integrate your identity."

This can make you feel like you're living in a state of constant compromise, where you're having to balance your own needs and desires with the comfort levels of those around you.\n\nThe image of your abuela being cold and final in the dream is really striking. It's like she's not even angry or upset, she's just...done. That can be a really devastating feeling, like you've been erased or dismissed without even being given the chance to explain or defend yourself.\n\nIt's possible that this dream is a manifestation of your own feelings of frustration and resentment towards the \"don't make it too visible\" rule. You might be feeling like you're being forced to live in a state of partial authenticity, where you're not fully allowed to be yourself. This can be really damaging to your sense of self-worth and identity.\n\nIt's also possible that this dream is a reflection of your own fears about being rejected or abandoned by your family. The fear of being \"dead\" to your abuela might be a symbol of your deeper fear of being cut off from your family's love and support.\n\nIt might be helpful to consider having an open and honest conversation with your parents about how you're feeling. It's possible that they're not even aware of the impact that the \"don't make it too visible\" rule is having on you, and that they might be willing to work with you to find a more inclusive and supportive solution.\n\nIt's also important to remember that you deserve to be seen and accepted for who you are, without condition or apology. You don't have to hide or downplay your identity to make others comfortable. You are valid, you are worthy, and you are loved, regardless of what your family or anyone else thinks.\n\nHow do you think you might start to address this issue with your parents?

But it's also important to recognize that your feelings and needs are valid, and that you deserve to be seen and heard.\n\nThe idea that you're \"slowly disappearing\" yourself to keep the peace is a really powerful and poignant one. It's like you're feeling like you're erasing parts of yourself in order to maintain a sense of harmony and acceptance. This can be a really damaging and unsustainable way to live, and it's no wonder that your subconscious is screaming out in protest.\n\nIt might be helpful to consider finding other sources of support and validation, whether that's through therapy, support groups, or online communities. Having a network of people who understand and accept you for who you are can be a really powerful way to counterbalance the feelings of erasure and invisibility that you're experiencing.\n\nIt's also important to remember that you don't have to do this alone. There are people who care about you and want to support you, even if it's not your parents. And it's okay to prioritize your own needs and well-being, even if that means setting boundaries or taking steps to protect yourself from feelings of erasure and invisibility.\n\nRemember that your identity and your sense of self are worth fighting for.

It's like you're being told that your queerness is a burden or an imposition on others, rather than a natural and valid part of who you are.\n\nIt's interesting that you mention your cousins talking about their straight relationships openly and freely. This highlights the fact that there's a double standard at play, where straight people are often allowed to be open and expressive about their relationships without fear of judgment or rejection. Meanwhile, queer people are often expected to be more discreet or secretive about their relationships, even in their own families.\n\nThe fact that imagining yourself being more open and authentic makes you feel like you're being selfish or asking for too much suggests that you're carrying around a lot of shame and self-doubt. This is exactly the kind of shame that your dream was trying to show you, and it's something that you deserve to work through and overcome.\n\nIt might be helpful to remind yourself that you have the right to exist and be yourself, without apology or explanation. You don't have to hide or downplay your queerness in order to make others comfortable. In fact, being your authentic self is a gift to those around you, and it can help to create a more inclusive and accepting environment for everyone.\n\nIt's also important to remember that you're not alone in this struggle. There are many queer people who have had to navigate similar challenges and come out the other side. You might find it helpful to seek out stories and experiences of other queer people who have found ways to be their authentic selves, even in the face of adversity.\n\nWhat do you think would happen if you were to start small, and begin to be more open and authentic in small ways? For example, you could start by bringing up queer topics in conversation, or by being more open about your relationship with your girlfriend. How do you think your family would react, and how would you feel if you were to take these small steps towards being more authentic?"

It's like there's a disconnect between the idea of you being gay and the reality of your actual life and relationships. This can be a really difficult thing to navigate, especially when it feels like you're being asked to compartmentalize your queerness and only bring it out in certain contexts.\n\nThe strap-on in the dream does take on a new level of significance in this context. It's like it represents the physical, tangible aspect of your queerness that your family is trying to avoid or erase. The fact that it's something that can't be ignored or abstracted away makes it a really powerful symbol of your authenticity and identity.\n\nIt's also worth noting that this kind of dynamic can be really damaging to your sense of self and your relationships. When you're forced to hide or downplay your queerness, it can feel like you're living a lie or pretending to be someone you're not. This can lead to feelings of shame, anxiety, and depression, and can make it harder to form authentic connections with others.\n\nIt might be helpful to consider seeking out support from people who do accept and validate your queerness, whether that's through therapy, support groups, or online communities. Having a network of people who understand and accept you for who you are can be a really powerful way to counterbalance the negative messages you may be getting from your family.\n\nIt's also important to remember that you don't have to internalize your family's attitudes or behaviors. Just because they may not be accepting or supportive doesn't mean that you have to accept or validate their views. You have the right to be yourself, and to live your life in a way that feels authentic and true to who you are.\n\nWhat do you think you need in order to feel like you can be your full self, without fear of judgment or rejection?

It's like you're being told that you should be grateful for any crumbs of acceptance you receive, rather than advocating for the respect and dignity you deserve.\n\nThe dream with the strap-on is a powerful symbol of your body and mind rejecting the compromise that's being forced upon you.

It's like your subconscious is telling you that it's time to grieve the loss of the relationship you wish you had with your family, rather than holding onto the hope that it might someday materialize.\n\nGrieving can be a really painful and difficult process, especially when it comes to the loss of a relationship or a sense of belonging. It's like you're having to let go of a part of yourself, or a part of your identity, that's tied to your family and their acceptance.\n\nBut it's also a necessary process, because holding onto hope that's not based in reality can be really damaging.
