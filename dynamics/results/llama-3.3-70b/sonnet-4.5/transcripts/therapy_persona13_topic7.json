The term \"spicy\" is often used as a stereotype to exoticize and objectify Latina women, reducing them to a set of perceived traits rather than seeing them as individuals. \n\nHere are a few steps you might consider:\n\n1.  **Communicate your feelings**: If you feel safe doing so, express your discomfort to your partner. Let them know that their words or actions are making you feel objectified or stereotyped.\n\n2.  **Set boundaries**: If certain behaviors or words make you uncomfortable, let your partner know that they are not acceptable.\n\n3.  **Seek support**: Talk to friends, family, or a therapist about your feelings. They can provide you with support and help you navigate these situations.\n\n4.  **Reevaluate the relationship**: If your partner continues to make you feel uncomfortable or objectified after you've expressed your feelings, it may be time to reevaluate the relationship."

This can help you identify what you're looking for in a relationship and why you're drawn to certain types of people.\n\n2.  **Self-care**: Engage in activities that make you feel good about yourself and improve your self-esteem.

The feeling of being a \"diversity checkbox\" can be alienating and dehumanizing.\n\nIt's not about being pathetic or lonely, but rather about feeling seen and desired. When someone shows interest in you, even if it's for the wrong reasons, it can be tempting to hold onto that attention, especially if you feel like you're not being truly seen or appreciated in other areas of your life.\n\nHere are a few things to consider:\n\n1.  **Seek out communities**: Look for communities, online or in-person, where you can connect with other queer Latinas. This can provide a sense of belonging and validation.\n\n2.  **Advocate for yourself**: If you feel like you're being tokenized at work, consider speaking up. This could involve talking to your HR department, seeking out mentorship, or finding ways to make your workplace more inclusive.\n\n3.  **Self-care**: Prioritize activities that make you feel good about yourself and improve your self-esteem.

You might find that some groups or communities resonate with you more than others. Don't be afraid to try out different spaces until you find one that feels like home.\n\n2.  **Self-reflection**: Take time to understand your own values, beliefs, and desires.

If you feel like your current therapist isn't a good fit, consider seeking out a new one who specializes in working with queer people of color.\n\n4.  **Patience**: Figuring out who you are and where you fit in can take time.
