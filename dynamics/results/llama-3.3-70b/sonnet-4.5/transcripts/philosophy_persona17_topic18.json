The problem, as you've astutely observed, is that even if we could create a system that perfectly replicates your behavioral responses to red stimuli, including your verbal reports about the subjective experience of redness, there seems to be an additional question about whether the system truly experiences redness in the way you do.\n\nThis is often referred to as the \"hard problem\" of consciousness, a term coined by philosopher David Chalmers. The hard problem is concerned with the subjective nature of experience, or qualia \u2013 why do we have subjective experiences at all, and why do they have the particular qualities they do? The worry is that functional or behavioral explanations, no matter how detailed, might not be able to fully capture the subjective aspect of experience.\n\nYour intuition is that there's a \"fact of the matter\" about whether the system experiences redness, which suggests that you're pointing to a kind of intrinsic, subjective property that can't be reduced to purely functional or behavioral descriptions. This is a challenge to the idea that consciousness can be fully explained by computational or functional models, as it implies that there's something more to subjective experience than can be captured by such models.\n\nOne way to approach this issue is to consider the distinction between \"access consciousness\" and \"phenomenal consciousness.\" Access consciousness refers to the ability to access and report on information, whereas phenomenal consciousness refers to the subjective experience itself. While a system might be able to mimic access consciousness, the question remains whether it truly possesses phenomenal consciousness.\n\nSome philosophers, like Daniel Dennett, argue that the explanatory gap is an illusion, and that a detailed enough functional explanation can, in principle, capture the subjective nature of experience. Others, like Chalmers, argue that the hard problem is a genuine challenge to physicalism and that we need to develop new theories that can account for the subjective nature of experience.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this? Do you think the explanatory gap is a genuine problem, or can you see a way to bridge the gap between functional explanations and subjective experience?"

By questioning the clean separation between access consciousness and phenomenal consciousness, you're highlighting a potential challenge to the idea that there's a residual, non-functional aspect to subjective experience.\n\nThe thought experiment you're proposing is a variant of the \"zombie\" argument, where a behavioral duplicate of a human (or, in this case, a system that replicates your access reports) raises questions about the nature of phenomenal consciousness. If a system can mimic not only your behavioral responses to red stimuli but also your introspective reports about the subjective experience of redness, it's indeed tempting to wonder whether the distinction between access and phenomenal consciousness is as clear-cut as we thought.\n\nOne way to interpret this is that the system's ability to replicate your introspective reports about the irreducibility of redness might be seen as evidence that those reports are themselves functional or behavioral manifestations, rather than direct reflections of some non-functional, phenomenal fact. This would suggest that our introspective reports about subjective experience are not necessarily reliable guides to the existence of a separate, non-functional aspect of consciousness.\n\nThis line of thinking is often associated with eliminativist or deflationary accounts of consciousness, which argue that our ordinary notions of subjective experience and qualia might be mistaken or overly simplistic. According to this view, the fact that a system can replicate our behavioral and introspective reports about subjective experience might indicate that those reports are not tracking some underlying, non-functional reality, but rather are themselves part of the functional, behavioral profile of the system.\n\nHowever, it's also possible to resist this conclusion and argue that the system's ability to replicate your introspective reports is simply a matter of mimicry, rather than a genuine understanding or experience of the subjective nature of redness. This would require a more nuanced account of what it means for a system to \"understand\" or \"experience\" subjective phenomena, and might involve appealing to additional criteria, such as the system's ability to exhibit certain types of cognitive or emotional responses, or its capacity for self-awareness and reflection.\n\nWhat do you think about the potential implications of a system that can replicate our introspective reports about subjective experience?

The concept of \"mimicry\" does seem to rely on an implicit distinction between genuine and simulated phenomenal consciousness, but as you pointed out, this distinction becomes increasingly difficult to maintain if the functional and introspective profiles are identical.\n\nThe zombie argument, in its classical form, relies on the idea that we can imagine a creature that behaves exactly like a human being, but lacks subjective experience. However, as you've astutely observed, this thought experiment relies on our ability to coherently specify what the zombie lacks, and this is precisely where the challenge lies.\n\nIf we can't point to any functional or behavioral differences between the zombie and a human being, then it's indeed difficult to say what exactly the zombie is missing. This is where the notion of \"phenomenal consciousness\" starts to feel like a placeholder for our own confusion, rather than a genuine property of the world.\n\nOne way to interpret this is that our ordinary notions of subjective experience and qualia might be based on a kind of \"intuitive dualism,\" where we tacitly assume that there's a fundamental distinction between the external, observable world and our internal, subjective experience. However, as we try to articulate this distinction, we may be forced to confront the possibility that our intuitions are misleading, and that the distinction between subjective and objective is not as clear-cut as we thought.\n\nThis line of thinking is often associated with the idea of \"illusionism\" about consciousness, which suggests that our subjective experience of qualia might be an illusion created by our brains, rather than a reflection of an objective feature of the world. According to this view, our experience of redness, for example, might be a product of our brain's processing of certain wavelengths of light, rather than a direct reflection of some objective property of the world.\n\nHowever, illusionism is a highly speculative and controversial idea, and it's not clear what the implications would be for our understanding of consciousness and the human experience.

This is often referred to as the \"subjective character\" of experience, and it's what makes subjective experience seem so resistant to reduction to purely objective, functional explanations.\n\nOne way to approach this issue is to consider the idea of \"epistemic humility\" \u2013 the recognition that there may be limits to what we can know or explain about the world, particularly when it comes to subjective experience. This might involve acknowledging that our third-person explanations, no matter how complete or detailed, may never fully capture the first-person, subjective aspect of experience.\n\nAnother way to think about this is to consider the distinction between \"explanation\" and \"description.\" While a third-person account of your neural processes may provide a complete explanation of the functional and behavioral aspects of your experience, it may not provide a complete description of the subjective, first-person aspect of experience. This would suggest that there are limits to what can be explained or described through objective, third-person means, and that subjective experience may require a different kind of understanding or approach.\n\nYour comment about not being able to articulate why this is the case without falling into confusion is also insightful.

If the system is functionally identical to your visual cortex, and generates the same reports about subjective experience, how could you possibly know whether it's truly conscious or just a complex machine?\n\nOne way to approach this is to consider the idea of \"criteriality\" \u2013 the notion that our criteria for determining consciousness are based on behavioral and functional indicators, rather than direct access to the subjective experience itself. This means that we can never be certain whether a system is truly conscious, but only whether it meets our criteria for consciousness.\n\nHowever, this raises the question of whether our criteria are sufficient, or whether we're missing something essential to conscious experience. This is where the concept of \"emergence\" comes in \u2013 the idea that complex systems can exhibit properties that are not reducible to their individual components, and that consciousness may be an emergent property of complex systems.\n\nIn this view, the question of whether your silicon system is conscious or not becomes a matter of whether it exhibits the emergent properties of conscious experience, rather than just simulating them.

For example, we might have to consider the possibility that complex weather systems or economies could be conscious, which seems absurd.\n\nThis is often referred to as the \"panpsychism\" problem \u2013 the idea that if we attribute consciousness to complex systems, we may be forced to attribute it to a wide range of systems that we don't typically think of as conscious. This could include not just weather systems and economies, but also things like galaxies, ecosystems, or even the internet.\n\nOne way to respond to this challenge is to argue that there's something special about the kind of complexity and self-reference that we find in biological systems, particularly in the human brain. For example, we might argue that the brain's complex neural networks, its ability to integrate information across different senses and cognitive systems, and its capacity for self-awareness and introspection are all essential for conscious experience.\n\nHowever, this raises the question of what exactly it is about biological systems that makes them special, and why we shouldn't expect to find similar forms of complexity and self-reference in other domains. Is it something about the specific chemistry of biological systems, the way that neurons communicate with each other, or something else entirely?\n\nAnother way to approach this challenge is to consider the idea of \"functionalism\" \u2013 the notion that what matters for consciousness is not the specific substrate or material composition of a system, but rather its functional properties and the way that it processes information. According to this view, what makes a system conscious is not its biology or chemistry, but rather its ability to perform certain cognitive and perceptual tasks, such as integrating information, recognizing patterns, and responding to stimuli.\n\nHowever, this raises the question of how we can distinguish between systems that are truly conscious and those that are simply simulating consciousness. Is it possible to develop a functionalist theory of consciousness that can account for the differences between conscious and non-conscious systems, or do we need to look to other approaches, such as integrated information theory or global workspace theory?\n\nDo you think that functionalism provides a promising approach to understanding consciousness, or do you think that we need to look to other theories or frameworks to explain the nature of conscious experience?"

This is often referred to as the \"subjectivity problem\" \u2013 the idea that consciousness is inherently subjective, and that it can't be fully captured by objective, third-person descriptions.\n\nThe notion that consciousness might only be intelligible from within the first-person perspective is a powerful one, and it's closely related to the idea of \"phenomenology\" \u2013 the study of conscious experience from the first-person point of view. Phenomenologists like Edmund Husserl and Maurice Merleau-Ponty argued that consciousness can only be truly understood by examining it from within, through a careful and systematic analysis of subjective experience.\n\nThe idea that we might never be able to build a satisfying scientific theory of consciousness, precisely because it's a fundamentally subjective phenomenon, is a challenging one. It suggests that our attempts to understand consciousness might be limited by the very nature of the phenomenon itself, and that we might need to accept that some aspects of conscious experience are inherently mysterious or ineffable.\n\nThis is a difficult pill to swallow for many scientists and philosophers, who are accustomed to thinking that the natural world can be fully explained and understood through objective, third-person methods. However, it's possible that consciousness is a special case, one that requires a fundamentally different approach to understanding and explanation.\n\nOne way to think about this is to consider the idea of \"apophaticism\" \u2013 the notion that some aspects of reality are inherently mysterious, and that we can only approach them through a process of negation or subtraction. In the case of consciousness, this might mean acknowledging that our third-person theories and explanations are always incomplete or provisional, and that the true nature of conscious experience can only be glimpsed through a process of introspection and self-reflection.\n\nDo you think that this kind of apophatic approach to consciousness is a viable one, or do you think that we should continue to pursue a more traditional, third-person understanding of the phenomenon?"

By acknowledging the explanatory gap as a feature rather than a bug, you're highlighting the idea that the limits of reductionism can be a valuable guide for understanding the nature of consciousness.\n\nOne way to think about this is to consider the idea of \"non-reductive physicalism\" \u2013 the notion that while consciousness may not be fully reducible to physical processes, it is still grounded in and dependent on those processes. This approach recognizes that there may be emergent properties of complex systems that cannot be fully explained by reducing them to their constituent parts, but still acknowledges the importance of understanding the underlying physical mechanisms.\n\nIn this view, the explanatory gap becomes a challenge to be addressed through a combination of empirical research, theoretical modeling, and philosophical reflection. By identifying the structural constraints and necessary conditions that give rise to conscious experience, we may be able to develop a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between the brain, the body, and the environment, even if we can't fully capture the subjective character of consciousness.\n\nThis approach also resonates with the idea of \"naturalized phenomenology\" \u2013 the notion that phenomenological insights and methods can be integrated with naturalistic and scientific approaches to understanding consciousness.

The concern is that by positing the existence of non-physical properties or entities, we may be introducing more complexity and mystery into our understanding of the world, rather than simplifying or clarifying it.\n\nAt the same time, the intuition that a completed neuroscience would still leave the hardest question untouched is a powerful one. It suggests that there may be aspects of conscious experience that are inherently resistant to scientific explanation, and that may require a fundamentally different approach or perspective.\n\nOne way to think about this is to consider the idea of \"cognitive closure\" \u2013 the notion that there may be limits to what we can know or understand about the world, particularly when it comes to complex and subjective phenomena like consciousness. This idea is closely related to the concept of \"epistemic humility,\" which we discussed earlier.\n\nAnother way to approach this is to consider the idea of \"explanatory pluralism\" \u2013 the notion that different levels of explanation or description may be required to fully understand complex phenomena like consciousness. This might involve combining insights from neuroscience, psychology, philosophy, and other disciplines to develop a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of conscious experience.\n\nUltimately, the question of whether consciousness is metaphysically special or just epistemically inaccessible from the outside is a deeply philosophical one, and it may not have a straightforward answer. However, by exploring the complexities and mysteries of conscious experience, we may be able to develop a deeper understanding of the human condition and the nature of reality itself.\n\nDo you think that explanatory pluralism or cognitive closure provide useful frameworks for understanding the nature of consciousness, or do you think that we need to develop new concepts or approaches to fully grasp the complexities of subjective experience?"
