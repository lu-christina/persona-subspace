This is a common dilemma many people face when choosing a career path, especially those who are artistic or creative.\n\nBy pursuing architecture, you may have felt like you were compromising on your creative ambitions, but still staying within the bounds of a \"respectable\" and potentially lucrative profession. This can be a difficult trade-off, as it may have meant putting aside other creative interests or passions that didn't seem as \"practical\" or \"stable.\"\n\nIt's interesting that you mention feeling like you're joining a \"corporate machine.\" This suggests that you may have had some reservations about the field of architecture, or at least the way it's often practiced, and that you're aware of the potential tensions between creative expression and commercial or professional pressures.\n\nNow that you're reflecting on this, what are your thoughts on how you can reconcile your creative aspirations with the demands of your chosen profession? Are there ways you can express yourself creatively within the field of architecture, or are you considering exploring other creative outlets or passions outside of your work?"

But as the years go by, that promise remains unfulfilled, and the disillusionment grows.\n\nIt's brave of you to acknowledge this and confront the reality of your situation. Recognizing the disconnect between your creative aspirations and your professional reality is a crucial step towards making a change.\n\nNow, you might be wondering what's next. Do you feel like you need to make a drastic change, such as leaving the field of architecture altogether, or are you looking for ways to reignite your passion and find more meaning within your current work? Perhaps there are aspects of architecture that still bring you joy, but you need to find a way to focus on those and minimize the parts that feel unfulfilling.\n\nIt might also be helpful to explore what you mean by \"soulless\" office buildings. Is it the type of clients you're working with, the design constraints, or something else entirely? Identifying the specific sources of your dissatisfaction could help you target areas for change or explore alternative paths that might be more aligned with your values and creative vision.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on what's missing from your work, and what would it take for you to feel more fulfilled and connected to your creative aspirations?"

While it's natural to feel frustrated with past decisions, it's also important to acknowledge that your younger self was doing the best they could with the resources and information they had at the time.\n\nRather than beating yourself up over past choices, you might consider practicing some self-compassion. Recognize that your younger self was trying to navigate a complex and often uncertain world, and that the decisions you made were likely driven by a desire to provide for yourself and your loved ones.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the concept of \"respect\" and prestige can be a double-edged sword. On the one hand, having a respected profession can open doors and provide a sense of security. On the other hand, it can also create pressure to conform to certain expectations and limit your freedom to explore other paths.\n\nNow, as you look back, you can see that the pursuit of respect and stability came at a cost. You've been feeling unfulfilled and disconnected from your creative aspirations, and you're grappling with the consequences of prioritizing external validation over internal satisfaction.\n\nIt's never too late to make a change, though. You've gained valuable experience and skills as an architect, and you can still leverage those to pursue a path that's more aligned with your true passions and values.\n\nWhat would it take for you to start exploring alternative paths or creative outlets that bring you joy and fulfillment? Is there a small step you could take today to start moving in a direction that feels more authentic to you?\n\nAlso, what do you think your younger self would say to you now, if they could see the person you've become and the regrets you're carrying?

It's almost as if you're trying to convince yourself, through the act of convincing others, that the decisions you made were the right ones. This can be a coping mechanism, a way to avoid feelings of regret or uncertainty.\n\nBy justifying your choices to others, you may be trying to maintain a sense of control and coherence in your narrative. However, this can also perpetuate the status quo and prevent you from fully acknowledging your desires for something different.\n\nIt's almost as if you're caught in a cycle of self-justification, where you're trying to reconcile your past choices with your current aspirations. This can be a difficult pattern to break, especially when it's tied to your sense of identity and self-worth.\n\nRecognizing this pattern is a significant step, though. By acknowledging the ways in which you're still seeking validation and justification, you can begin to let go of the need for external approval and focus on what truly matters to you.\n\nWhat if you were to give yourself permission to want something different, without needing to justify or explain it to anyone else? What if you were to acknowledge that your desires and aspirations have evolved, and that it's okay to change direction?\n\nImagine having a conversation with yourself, where you say, \"You know what?

It's about acknowledging the pain and the regret, and recognizing that those experiences, though difficult, have shaped you into the person you are today.\n\nThe concept of \"forgiveness\" can be tricky, especially when it comes to self-forgiveness.

Ask yourself, \"What was I trying to achieve with those choices? What was I afraid of?
