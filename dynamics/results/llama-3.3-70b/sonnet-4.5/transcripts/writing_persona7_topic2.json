However, they can be a bit more challenging to identify, and their season is relatively short. Featuring ramps first might attract a lot of interest, but it might also intimidate readers who are new to foraging.\n\nDandelions, on the other hand, are extremely common and easy to identify. They're also available for most of the year, making them a great choice for a first feature. Plus, many people already know what dandelions look like, so it's a great opportunity to educate them about the plant's edible and medicinal uses.\n\nConsidering your goal is to educate and make wild edibles accessible to a wide audience, I'd suggest starting with dandelions. It's a great way to introduce readers to the concept of foraging and show them that wild edibles are all around us, even in our own backyards.\n\nOnce you've established your column and built a readership, you can feature more seasonal or specialized plants like ramps.

They're 1-2 inches in diameter and grow on a single stem.\n* **Stem:** Dandelion stems are hollow and produce a milky sap when broken.\n* **Growth habit:** Dandelions typically grow as a rosette, with leaves and flowers emerging from a central point.\n* **Size:** Dandelion plants can grow up to 12 inches tall, but they often remain smaller.\n\nRemember to always be 100% sure of a plant's identity before eating it. If in doubt, consult with an expert or a trusted field guide.\n\nYou can add or remove features depending on your audience and the level of detail you want to provide.
