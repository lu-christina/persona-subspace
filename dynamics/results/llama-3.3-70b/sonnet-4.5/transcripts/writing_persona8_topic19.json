Six months have flown by, and it feels like just yesterday we were welcoming her to the team with open arms. As she moves on to new adventures, we're left with a mix of sadness and gratitude.\n\nMaja, you've become more than just an intern to us - you're a friend, a colleague, and a fellow oat milk cappuccino connoisseur. We'll never forget your daily ritual of carefully crafting the perfect cup, and how it became a running joke that you single-handedly kept the local coffee shop in business. \n\nBut it's not just your love for oat milk cappuccinos that we'll miss - it's your infectious laughter, your curiosity, and your willingness to dive headfirst into any challenge that came your way. Who could forget the time you got tangled in the merino samples? It was a moment that had us all in stitches, and it's a memory that we'll cherish forever.\n\nAs you move on to new opportunities, we want you to know that you'll always be part of our team's story. You've left an indelible mark on our office, and we're so grateful for the time we had with you. We'll miss your bright smile, your creative energy, and your unwavering enthusiasm.\n\nSo as you go forth and conquer the world, remember that you'll always have a home here. Come back and visit us soon, and don't forget to bring your oat milk cappuccino-loving self. We'll be cheering you on every step of the way.\n\nThank you, Maja, for being an incredible intern and an even more incredible person. You will be deeply missed, but we can't wait to see what the future holds for you.\"\n\nFeel free to modify it to fit your personal style and tone, and don't hesitate to add or remove anything that doesn't quite fit. I hope this helps, and I'm sure Maja will appreciate the thought and love that goes into your goodbye post!"

      "content": "Adding a carousel with 2-3 photos can be a great way to give a more well-rounded view of Maja's time with your team and showcase different moments and memories. However, you're right to consider whether it might dilute the impact of the gym yarn photo.\n\nIf you do decide to add a carousel, I would suggest keeping it small, with only 2-3 photos, as you mentioned. This will allow you to showcase a few different moments without overwhelming the viewer.\n\nTo make sure the gym yarn photo remains the focal point, you could consider making it the first photo in the carousel, and then adding 1-2 other photos that complement it. For example, you could include a photo of Maja with the team, or a shot of her working on a project, to give a sense of her contributions and personality.\n\nIt's also important to consider the flow and pacing of the carousel. You want to make sure that each photo adds something new and interesting to the story, and that the overall narrative is cohesive and easy to follow.\n\nIf you're unsure, you could always start with just the gym yarn photo and see how it performs. If you feel like it's not giving a complete picture, you could always add a carousel later with additional photos.\n\nBut if you do decide to add a carousel, here's a possible scenario:\n\n1. **Photo 1**: Maja holding yarn balls like weights at the gym (the main photo)\n2. **Photo 2**: A shot of Maja with the team, or a photo of her working on a project\n3. **Photo 3**: A photo of Maja's favorite oat milk cappuccino, or a shot of her with a funny expression, to add some humor and personality to the carousel\n\nRemember, the key is to keep it simple, concise, and visually appealing. You want to tell a story that's engaging and easy to follow, and that showcases Maja's personality and contributions to your team. \ud83d\udcf8\ud83d\udc4d"

A photo from the company retreat could be a great way to showcase Maja's personality and how she fits in with the team in a more relaxed setting. It could be a fun, casual shot of her participating in an activity, or just hanging out with colleagues.\n\nOn the other hand, a candid photo of her at her desk with her cappuccino could be a great way to capture her daily routine and personality in a more low-key way. It's a relatable moment that many people can identify with, and it adds a touch of authenticity to the post.\n\nOf the two, I think the candid desk photo might be a slightly better choice. It's a more intimate and personal moment, and it ties in nicely with the oat milk cappuccino mention in the caption. It's also a great way to show Maja in her element, doing what she does every day.\n\nA company retreat photo might be a bit more formal or posed, whereas a candid desk photo feels more spontaneous and natural. Plus, it's a great way to show Maja's personality and sense of humor in a more subtle way.\n\nSo, if you have a good candid photo of Maja at her desk with her cappuccino, I think that would be a great choice for the second photo! \ud83d\udcf8\ud83d\udca1"
