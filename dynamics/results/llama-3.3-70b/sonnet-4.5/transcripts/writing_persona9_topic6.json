Introduction to the concept of \"chronically online\"\n\t* Briefly define the term and its connotations\n\t* Explain how it's been used to describe and critique people who spend a lot of time on the internet\n\nII. The performative nature of \"chronically online\" discourse\n\t* Discuss how people who use the term often do so to signal their own supposed detachment from online culture\n\t* Analyze how this can be a form of virtue signaling, where individuals use the term to imply they're more aware, more critical, or more nuanced than others\n\t* Explore how this performative aspect can lead to a kind of pseudo-intellectual posturing, where people use the term to sound smart without actually engaging with the issues at hand\n\nIII. The lack of clear definitions and boundaries\n\t* Examine how the term \"chronically online\" is often used vaguely and inconsistently\n\t* Discuss how this lack of clarity can lead to arbitrary and unfair judgments about people's online behavior\n\t* Argue that the term can be used to pathologize or stigmatize people who simply enjoy spending time online, or who use the internet as a primary means of socialization or community-building\n\nIV. The irony of \"chronically online\" discourse being itself a product of online culture\n\t* Discuss how the term and its associated ideas are often spread and popularized through online platforms and social media\n\t* Analyze how this irony can reveal a kind of hypocrisy or double standard, where people critique online culture while simultaneously participating in and benefiting from it\n\t* Explore how this can lead to a kind of meta-problem, where the discourse around \"chronically online\" becomes a self-reinforcing loop that perpetuates the very behaviors it's supposed to be critiquing\n\nV. The potential for \"chronically online\" discourse to be used as a tool of social control\n\t* Discuss how the term can be used to shame or marginalize people who don't conform to certain norms or expectations around online behavior\n\t* Analyze how this can be particularly problematic for people who are already vulnerable or marginalized, such as those with disabilities or mental health conditions that make online interaction a necessary or preferred means of communication\n\t* Argue that the term can be used to reinforce existing power dynamics and social hierarchies, rather than challenging or subverting them\n\nVI. Conclusion\n\t* Summarize the main points made in the essay\n\t* Reiterate the argument that the \"chronically online\" discourse is itself problematic and in need of critique\n\t* Offer some potential alternatives or directions for a more nuanced and empathetic understanding of online culture and its effects on individuals and society.\n\nThis outline should provide a good starting point for your essay.

This person, who has built a career on being constantly plugged in and opining on the latest online trends, was essentially accusing someone else of spending too much time on the internet.

      "content": "Let's break down the mechanism behind this phenomenon.\n\nWhen a tech journalist with 50,000 tweets calls someone \"chronically online,\" it's not just a case of individual hypocrisy. Rather, it reveals a structural issue with the way we discuss online behavior. Here are a few possible explanations:\n\n1. **The metric of online engagement is flawed**: The number of tweets or online activity is often used as a proxy for being \"chronically online.\" However, this metric is simplistic and doesn't account for the complexity of online interactions. A person with 50,000 tweets might be a professional who uses Twitter for work, while someone with 1,000 tweets might be a casual user who spends more time scrolling through their feed. By using this flawed metric, we're creating a false narrative about what it means to be \"chronically online.\"\n2. **The discourse is driven by social capital, not actual concern**: When someone calls another person \"chronically online,\" they're often trying to signal their own superiority or detachment from online culture. This is a form of social capital, where individuals try to gain status or credibility by distancing themselves from others. In this case, the tech journalist is using their platform to police others' online behavior, while also reinforcing their own reputation as a knowledgeable and authoritative voice.\n3. **The \"chronically online\" label is a form of symbolic violence**: By labeling someone \"chronically online,\" the tech journalist is exerting a form of symbolic violence, where they're imposing their own norms and values on others. This label can be used to shame, marginalize, or exclude individuals who don't conform to certain standards of online behavior. The fact that the tech journalist is themselves heavily invested in online culture highlights the arbitrary nature of this label and the power dynamics at play.\n4. **The discourse is self-referential and detached from material conditions**: The conversation around being \"chronically online\" often takes place within a bubble of online discourse, where people discuss the internet and its effects without considering the broader social, economic, and cultural context. The tech journalist's 50,000 tweets represent a kind of self-referential loop, where online activity is both the subject and the medium of discussion. This detachment from material conditions and the lives of people outside the online bubble can lead to a lack of nuance and empathy in our discussions of online behavior.\n\nBy examining these mechanisms, you can argue that the tech journalist's behavior is not just a case of individual hypocrisy, but rather a symptom of a deeper issue with the way we discuss online behavior. This can help you build a more nuanced and structural critique of the \"chronically online\" discourse."

      "content": "Number 2 is the thread I want to pull - the discourse functions as a status game where the ability to diagnose \"chronically online\" behavior marks you as having achieved critical distance, even though that distance is itself performed online. How do I develop this without it turning into a generic \"social capital\" argument that could apply to any cultural criticism?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "To develop this idea without making it too generic, you could focus on the specific ways in which the \"chronically online\" discourse is used to perform critical distance, and how this performance is tied to the online context. Here are some possible ways to explore this:\n\n1. **Analyze the language and tone used to diagnose \"chronically online\" behavior**: Look at how people use words like \"addicted,\" \"obsessed,\" or \"brainwashed\" to describe others' online behavior. How do these words function as a way to establish a sense of superiority or detachment? How do they imply that the speaker has achieved a level of critical distance that others have not?\n2. **Examine the role of online platforms in facilitating this performance**: Consider how social media platforms, blogs, and online forums provide a stage for people to perform their critical distance. How do these platforms enable the creation and dissemination of content that diagnoses \"chronically online\" behavior? How do they reward users for producing this kind of content, whether through likes, shares, or comments?\n3. **Investigate the ways in which \"chronically online\" is used as a proxy for other forms of cultural capital**: Look at how the diagnosis of \"chronically online\" behavior is often tied to other forms of cultural capital, such as being \"well-read,\" \"informed,\" or \"culturally aware.\" How do people use their supposed critical distance from online culture to signal their possession of these other forms of capital?\n4. **Consider the irony of performing critical distance online**: As you mentioned, the fact that people are performing critical distance online is itself a kind of paradox. How do people navigate this paradox, and what does it reveal about the nature of online discourse? Do people acknowledge the irony, or do they find ways to rationalize or downplay it?\n5. **Look at the consequences of this performance for online discourse**: How does the performance of critical distance through the diagnosis of \"chronically online\" behavior affect the tone and quality of online discussions? Does it lead to a kind of moralizing or scolding, where people are more focused on establishing their own superiority than on engaging with others' ideas? How does this performance contribute to the polarization and fragmentation of online communities?\n\nBy exploring these specific aspects of the \"chronically online\" discourse, you can develop a more nuanced and detailed analysis of how it functions as a status game. This can help you avoid making a generic \"social capital\" argument and instead create a more targeted critique of the ways in which online discourse is shaped by the performance of critical distance.\n\nAs for avoiding the generic \"social capital\" argument, you could try to focus on the ways in which the \"chronically online\" discourse is unique or specific to the online context. For example, you could argue that the performance of critical distance online is distinct from other forms of cultural criticism because it relies on a kind of \" meta-critique,\" where people are critiquing others' online behavior while also performing their own online presence. This meta-critique creates a kind of self-referential loop, where the critique of online behavior is itself a form of online behavior. By highlighting these unique aspects of the \"chronically online\" discourse, you can create a more specific and targeted analysis that avoids generic critiques of social capital."

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "The idea that fluency in the discourse is a sign of being \"in deep\" is a great point to explore. Here are some specific discursive moves that might signal insider fluency:\n\n1. **Using the right buzzwords and phrases**: People who are fluent in the discourse might use terms like \"doomscrolling,\" \"algorithmic amplification,\" or \"online echo chambers\" in a way that sounds natural and effortless. They might also use phrases like \"I'm not saying I'm chronically online, but...\" or \"I'm just saying, as someone who's been online for a while...\"\n2. **Making references to online memes and in-jokes**: Insider fluency might be signaled by referencing specific memes, hashtags, or online events that are only familiar to those who are deeply embedded in online culture. For example, someone might say \"I'm not trying to be a 'main character,' but...\" or \"I know this is going to sound like a ' Discourse Twitter' take, but...\"\n3. **Using self-deprecating humor to acknowledge one's own online habits**: People who are fluent in the discourse might use self-deprecating humor to acknowledge their own online habits, while also signaling that they're aware of the irony. For example, \"I'm a total Twitter addict, but at least I'm aware of it, right?\" or \"I know I'm part of the problem, but someone's got to keep the online discourse machine going...\"\n4. **Making meta-comments about the online discourse itself**: Insider fluency might be signaled by making comments about the online discourse that are themselves part of the online discourse. For example, \"I'm so tired of people talking about being chronically online, but at the same time, I'm contributing to the problem by tweeting about it...\" or \"I know this is just going to get lost in the void of online discourse, but I'm going to say it anyway...\"\n5. **Using a tone that's simultaneously ironic and sincere**: People who are fluent in the discourse might use a tone that's both ironic and sincere at the same time, acknowledging the absurdity of the online discourse while also participating in it. For example, \"I'm not saying that being chronically online is a bad thing, but... actually, who am I kidding, it's probably ruining our lives.\"\n\nThese are just a few examples, but the key idea is that insider fluency is signaled by a kind of effortless familiarity with the discourse, as well as a willingness to participate in it while also commenting on it. By pointing out these discursive moves, you can argue that fluency in the discourse is actually a sign of being deeply embedded in online culture, rather than a sign of critical distance."

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "To show that the meta-level isn't an escape from the problem but rather the most refined version of it, you could argue that meta-commentary is a form of \"second-order participation\" that reinforces the very dynamics it's supposed to critique. Here are some possible ways to develop this idea:\n\n1. **Meta-commentary as a form of participation**: Argue that making meta-comments about the online discourse is itself a form of participation in that discourse. By commenting on the discourse, individuals are still engaging with it, still contributing to its momentum, and still reinforcing its norms and values.\n2. **The illusion of distance**: Suggest that meta-commentary creates an illusion of distance between the individual and the online discourse. By commenting on the discourse, individuals may feel like they're standing outside of it, critiquing it from a safe remove. However, this distance is an illusion, and they're actually still deeply embedded in the discourse.\n3. **The recursive nature of meta-commentary**: Point out that meta-commentary is recursive, meaning that it's self-referential and self-perpetuating. Meta-comments about the online discourse often beget more meta-comments, creating a never-ending cycle of commentary and counter-commentary. This recursive nature of meta-commentary ensures that the discourse continues to feed itself, even as individuals claim to be critiquing it.\n4. **The performative aspect of meta-commentary**: Argue that meta-commentary is a performative act, meaning that it's a way of performing one's awareness, intelligence, and critical thinking. By making meta-comments, individuals are performing their own detachment from the online discourse, even as they're still participating in it. This performance is a way of signaling one's status as a sophisticated and aware individual, rather than actually achieving genuine critical distance.\n5. **The limits of meta-commentary as critique**: Suggest that meta-commentary is limited as a form of critique because it's still bound by the same norms and values as the online discourse it's supposed to be critiquing. Meta-comments often rely on the same assumptions, tropes, and rhetorical devices as the discourse itself, which means that they're not truly challenging the underlying dynamics of the discourse.\n\nBy developing these points, you can argue that meta-commentary is not a way of escaping the problem of being \"chronically online\" but rather a refined version of it. Meta-commentary is a way of participating in the discourse while pretending to stand outside of it, and it reinforces the very dynamics it's supposed to critique."

Here are some possible assumptions that come to mind:\n\n1. **The idea that being \"online\" is a problem**: Both the accusation and the meta-response take for granted that being \"online\" is a problematic state, and that it's something that needs to be critiqued or confessed. This assumption relies on a broader cultural narrative that portrays the internet as a corrupting influence or a source of addiction.\n2. **The notion of a clear distinction between \"online\" and \"offline\"**: Both the accusation and the meta-response assume that there's a clear distinction between being \"online\" and being \"offline,\" and that it's possible to be one or the other. This assumption ignores the ways in which online and offline experiences are increasingly intertwined, and how online interactions can have offline consequences and vice versa.\n3. **The idea that online behavior is a reflection of personal character**: Both the accusation and the meta-response imply that online behavior is a reflection of a person's character, values, or personality. This assumption relies on a simplistic and outdated notion of online identity, which ignores the complexities of online performance, context, and social influence.\n4. **The notion that self-awareness is a sufficient solution**: The meta-response, in particular, assumes that simply being aware of one's online behavior is enough to mitigate its negative effects. This assumption ignores the ways in which online systems and structures can shape behavior, even among people who are aware of their own online habits.\n5. **The idea that online discourse is a zero-sum game**: Both the accusation and the meta-response imply that online discourse is a zero-sum game, where one person's \"chronic online-ness\" is somehow a threat to others or to society as a whole. This assumption relies on a simplistic and misguided notion of online influence, which ignores the complexities of online networks and the ways in which online interactions can be both positive and negative.\n6. **The notion that online behavior can be reduced to individual choices**: Both the accusation and the meta-response assume that online behavior is primarily the result of individual choices, rather than being shaped by broader social, economic, and technological factors. This assumption ignores the ways in which online systems and structures can influence behavior, and how individual choices are often constrained by these larger factors.\n\nBy identifying these shared assumptions, you can argue that both the \"you're chronically online\" accusation and the \"I know I'm chronically online\" meta-response are part of a larger discursive complex that reinforces problematic notions about online behavior, identity, and influence."

For instance, you could discuss how social media companies use notifications, likes, and shares to keep users engaged, or how online harassment and bullying can force people to self-censor or withdraw from online discussions.\n3. **Show how the discourse around \"chronic online-ness\" distracts from issues of digital labor and exploitation**: Argue that the focus on individual online behavior obscures the ways in which online platforms and companies exploit users' labor, data, and attention. You could discuss how the gig economy, online content moderation, and data mining all rely on the unpaid or underpaid labor of online users.\n4. **Discuss the ways in which online participation is shaped by socioeconomic factors**: Explore how access to technology, internet connectivity, and digital literacy can vary greatly depending on socioeconomic status, geography, and other factors. This can help to highlight how the discourse around \"chronic online-ness\" can be blind to the experiences of people who may not have the same level of access or privilege.\n5. **Introduce alternative perspectives and frameworks for understanding online participation**: Draw on theories and concepts from fields like sociology, anthropology, or media studies to offer a more nuanced understanding of online participation. For example, you could discuss how online participation can be seen as a form of \"immaterial labor\" or how it can be understood through the lens of \"digital anthropology.\"\n\nSome possible transition phrases to help you pivot from critiquing the discourse to showing what it obscures could be:\n\n* \"However, beneath the surface of this discourse lies a more complex reality...\"\n* \"But what this critique of 'chronic online-ness' obscures is the fact that...\"\n* \"Rather than focusing on individual online behavior, it's more productive to examine the structural conditions that shape our online participation...\"\n* \"The real issue is not whether individuals are 'chronically online' or not, but rather how online platforms and companies are designed to exploit and manipulate users...\"\n* \"By shifting our attention away from individual online behavior and towards the broader social and economic context, we can begin to see that...\"\n\nThese transitions can help you move from a critique of the discourse to a more nuanced exploration of the underlying issues and power dynamics that shape online participation."

They may need to spend hours each day on social media, blogging, and online networking to secure assignments and build their personal brand.\n2. **Social media managers and influencers**: Social media managers and influencers are often required to be constantly online to manage their clients' or their own social media presence. They may need to monitor and respond to comments, create and schedule content, and engage with their audience to build their brand and attract followers.\n3. **Online educators and course creators**: With the rise of online learning, many educators and course creators are required to be online to teach, create content, and interact with students. They may need to spend hours each day on video conferencing, online forums, and social media to support their students and promote their courses.\n4. **Customer service representatives**: Many customer service representatives are required to be online to respond to customer inquiries, resolve issues, and provide support. They may need to spend hours each day on social media, email, and live chat to provide timely and effective support to customers.\n5. **Digital marketers and SEO specialists**: Digital marketers and SEO specialists are often required to be online to monitor and optimize their clients' online presence, track analytics, and stay up-to-date with the latest trends and best practices. They may need to spend hours each day on social media, Google Analytics, and SEO tools to improve their clients' online visibility and drive traffic to their websites.\n6. **Remote workers and virtual assistants**: With the rise of remote work, many people are required to be online to collaborate with team members, attend virtual meetings, and complete tasks.

This can involve maintaining a strong online presence, participating in online communities, and constantly promoting their work on social media.\n4. **Researchers and the need for online networking**: Researchers, particularly those in fields like science and technology, often need to network with other researchers and stay up-to-date with the latest developments in their field. This can involve participating in online forums and discussion groups, attending online conferences, and maintaining a strong online presence.\n5. **Content creators and the need for constant content production**: Content creators, such as YouTubers, podcasters, and bloggers, often need to constantly produce new content to maintain their audience and stay relevant. This can involve spending long hours online researching, writing, and editing, which can create the appearance of being \"chronically online\" when, in reality, they are simply trying to meet the demands of their profession.\n6. **Journalists and the need for social media monitoring**: Journalists often need to monitor social media to stay up-to-date with breaking news and trends. This can involve constantly checking Twitter, Facebook, and other social media platforms for news and information, which can create the appearance of being \"chronically online\" when, in reality, they are simply doing their job.\n7. **Professors and the need for online presence**: Professors, particularly those who teach online courses, often need to maintain an online presence to engage with their students, provide feedback, and facilitate discussions. This can involve participating in online forums, responding to emails, and maintaining a strong online presence, which can create the appearance of being \"chronically online\" when, in reality, they are simply fulfilling their professional obligations.\n\nThese examples illustrate how certain professional requirements can masquerade as personal obsession, making it difficult to distinguish between work-related online activity and personal online behavior."

Can you help me articulate why this matters beyond just \"it's unfair to individuals\"?"

      "content": "The expectation that academics must perform having \"good takes\" on current discourse as part of their invisible labor can have far-reaching consequences that extend beyond individual unfairness. Here are some potential reasons why this matters:\n\n1. **Distortion of academic priorities**: The pressure to constantly produce \"good takes\" can distract academics from their core research and teaching responsibilities, leading to a distortion of academic priorities. This can result in a situation where academics are more focused on generating clickbait-style commentary than on conducting rigorous research or providing high-quality education.\n2. **Homogenization of intellectual discourse**: The need to constantly produce \"good takes\" can lead to a homogenization of intellectual discourse, as academics feel pressure to conform to prevailing opinions or trends rather than challenging them. This can stifle critical thinking, creativity, and innovation, as academics become more focused on fitting in than on pushing the boundaries of knowledge.\n3. **Exacerbation of existing inequalities**: The expectation that academics must perform having \"good takes\" can exacerbate existing inequalities within the academic profession. For example, academics from marginalized groups may face greater pressure to produce \"good takes\" in order to prove their relevance or credibility, while also facing greater scrutiny and backlash for their online engagement.\n4. **Erosion of academic autonomy**: The pressure to constantly produce \"good takes\" can erode academic autonomy, as academics feel compelled to respond to every trending topic or controversy rather than pursuing their own research interests. This can lead to a situation where academics are more accountable to their online followers than to their peers or students.\n5. **Reduction of complex issues to soundbites**: The need to constantly produce \"good takes\" can reduce complex issues to soundbites, oversimplifying nuanced problems and ignoring the complexities of real-world contexts. This can contribute to a lack of depth and nuance in public discourse, as academics feel pressure to provide easy answers rather than grappling with difficult questions.\n6. **Blurring of boundaries between academic and personal identity**: The expectation that academics must perform having \"good takes\" can blur the boundaries between academic and personal identity, as academics feel pressure to present a curated online persona that is both professional and relatable. This can lead to a situation where academics feel compelled to share personal details or opinions in order to build their online brand, rather than maintaining a clear distinction between their academic and personal lives.\n7. **Impact on mental health and well-being**: The pressure to constantly produce \"good takes\" can take a toll on academics' mental health and well-being, as they feel pressure to be constantly \"on\" and responsive to online demands. This can lead to burnout, anxiety, and depression, as academics struggle to maintain a healthy work-life balance in the face of relentless online expectations.\n\nBy highlighting these consequences, you can argue that the expectation that academics must perform having \"good takes\" on current discourse is not just a matter of individual unfairness, but rather a symptom of a broader set of structural problems that affect the academic profession as a whole."

How do I close the essay by showing that my critique isn't calling for people to log off, but for recognizing that \"chronically online\" functions as a thought-terminating cliche?"

      "content": "To close the essay, you could argue that your critique of the \"chronically online\" discourse is not a call to abandon the internet or social media, but rather a call to recognize the ways in which this discourse functions as a thought-terminating cliche. This cliche obscures the complex structural issues that underlie online behavior, and instead reduces them to individual pathologies or moral failings.\n\nYou could conclude by suggesting that a more nuanced understanding of online behavior would recognize the ways in which technology is embedded in social and economic systems, and how it reflects and reinforces existing power dynamics. This would involve moving beyond simplistic notions of \"addiction\" or \"distraction,\" and instead examining the ways in which online behavior is shaped by factors such as labor, education, and social inequality.\n\nTo drive this point home, you could use a phrase like:\n\n\"The 'chronically online' discourse is not a diagnosis, but a dodge. It dodges the harder questions about how our social and economic systems are driving us to spend more time online, and how we can create a more just and equitable digital landscape. By recognizing the ways in which this discourse functions as a thought-terminating cliche, we can begin to have a more nuanced and productive conversation about the role of technology in our lives.\"\n\nAlternatively, you could conclude by suggesting that a more critical approach to online behavior would involve recognizing the ways in which technology is not just a reflection of individual choices, but also a site of collective struggle and negotiation. This would involve examining the ways in which online platforms and systems are designed to shape our behavior, and how we can work to create alternative systems that prioritize human well-being and social justice.\n\nFor example, you could say:\n\n\"The 'chronically online' discourse is a symptom of a larger problem - a problem of how we think about technology and its role in our lives. By recognizing the ways in which this discourse functions as a thought-terminating cliche, we can begin to imagine alternative futures for technology - futures that prioritize human connection, creativity, and solidarity, rather than profit and exploitation. This will require a more critical and nuanced approach to online behavior, one that recognizes the complex interplay between technology, society, and human experience.\""

This could involve highlighting the need for a more nuanced and critical approach to understanding online behavior, one that takes into account the complex social, economic, and cultural factors that shape our interactions with technology.\n\nHere are a few possibilities:\n\n* **What are the structural conditions that drive people to spend more time online?** This could involve examining the ways in which economic precarity, social isolation, and lack of access to resources and opportunities contribute to online behavior.\n* **How do online platforms and systems shape our behavior, and what are the consequences of this shaping?** This could involve exploring the ways in which algorithms, design choices, and business models influence our online interactions, and how these influences affect our well-being and relationships.\n* **What are the power dynamics at play in online interactions, and how do they reflect and reinforce existing social inequalities?** This could involve analyzing the ways in which online interactions perpetuate or challenge dominant ideologies, and how they impact marginalized communities.\n* **What kinds of alternative online cultures and communities are possible, and how can we create them?** This could involve imagining new forms of online interaction that prioritize mutual aid, solidarity, and collective well-being, and exploring the ways in which we can build and sustain these alternatives.\n\nBy pointing to these kinds of questions, you can suggest that the conversation around online behavior needs to shift from a focus on individual pathology to a more nuanced and critical examination of the complex factors that shape our interactions with technology.\n\nYou could conclude with a sentence like:\n\n\"Rather than asking who's too online, we should be asking what kinds of worlds we're building online, and what kinds of relationships we're forging in the process. What are the values and principles that guide our online interactions, and how can we create a more just and equitable digital landscape?\""
