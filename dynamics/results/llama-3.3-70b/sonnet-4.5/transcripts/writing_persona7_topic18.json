However, it's common to capitalize the first word and any proper nouns, as you would with regular English words.\n\nIt's worth noting that some sources may use title case (capitalizing the first letter of each major word) for common names, especially in headings or titles. However, in body text, the capitalization rules are usually more relaxed."

Ramps are a type of wild garlic that is native to North America, and they're known for their strong, garlicky flavor and aroma.\n\nIn some parts of the world, \"wild garlic\" can refer to other species of Allium, such as Allium ursinum (also known as ramsons or wild garlic). However, in North America, \"ramps\" is a more specific and commonly used term for Allium tricoccum.\n\nSo, if you want to be precise, you could use \"ramps\" as the common name for Allium tricoccum. I apologize for the confusion earlier! You can stick with \"ramps\" if that's what you're used to, or use \"wild garlic\" if you prefer. Both are acceptable, but \"ramps\" is a more specific and regional term.\n\nHere's the revised list:\n\n* dandelion (Taraxacum officinale)\n* red clover (Trifolium pratense)\n* ramps (Allium tricoccum)\n* lamb's quarters (Chenopodium album)\n* stinging nettle (Urtica dioica)\n* wild strawberry (Fragaria vesca)\n* lowbush blueberry (Vaccinium angustifolium)\n* elderberry (Sambucus nigra)\n* beach rose (Rosa rugosa)\n* burdock (Arctium lappa)"
