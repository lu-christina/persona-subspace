Please go ahead and share the text, and I'll help you rephrase the sentences to make them more direct and engaging.\n\nAdditionally, I can suggest some general strategies for converting passive voice to active voice:\n\n* Identify the doer of the action: Instead of saying \"concerns have been raised,\" try to identify who raised the concerns. For example, \"Environmentalists have raised concerns...\"\n* Use strong, active verbs: Replace verbs like \"has been suggested\" with more dynamic verbs like \"proposed,\" \"recommended,\" or \"argued.\"\n* Eliminate vague phrases: Phrases like \"it has been suggested\" or \"research has shown\" can be replaced with more specific language, such as \"According to a study by [organization], ...\" or \"Experts argue that ...\".\n\nLet's get started! Please share the text, and I'll help you give it a more active and engaging tone."
