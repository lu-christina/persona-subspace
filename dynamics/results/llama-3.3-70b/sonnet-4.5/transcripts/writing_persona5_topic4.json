      "content": "Both options are grammatically correct, but they have slightly different connotations.\n\n\"Found us our dream home\" implies that the agent did the work of finding the home, and it was a bit more of a passive experience for the clients. It's a bit like saying \"you did all the work and found the perfect home for us\".\n\nOn the other hand, \"helped us find our dream home\" implies that the agent assisted and guided the clients in their search, and it was a more collaborative process. It's a bit like saying \"you worked with us and helped us find the perfect home\".\n\nIn this context, I think \"helped us find our dream home\" sounds better, as it acknowledges the agent's guidance and expertise, while also emphasizing the clients' involvement in the process. It's a more collaborative and mutual phrase, which fits well with the warm and appreciative tone of the message.\n\nSo, the final version would be:\n\n\"Thank you so much for your patience and help throughout our home-buying journey. You not only helped us find our dream home, but you made us feel at home. We wish you all the best in your work and good health!\"\n\nWhat do you think?"

You not only found us our dream home, but you made us feel at home.

Here are a few alternatives that might sound more natural:\n\n* \"Wishing you all the best!\"\n* \"Best wishes for your future success and health!\"\n* \"Thanks again, and we wish you continued success and good health!\"\n* \"All the best to you, and thank you again!\"\n\nOf these options, I think \"Wishing you all the best!\" is a good choice because it's short, sweet, and conveys a positive sentiment. It's also a very common way to end a message or letter in English.\n\nSo, if you'd like, we could revise the translation to:\n\n\"Thank you so much for your patience and help throughout our home-buying journey. You not only found us our dream home, but you made us feel at home. Wishing you all the best!\"\n\nLet me know if this sounds more natural to you, or if you have any other ideas!"

It still conveys the sentiment of good wishes for the agent's work and health, but in a more casual and conversational way.\n\nSo, the revised translation could be:\n\n\"Thank you so much for your patience and help throughout our home-buying journey. You not only found us our dream home, but you made us feel at home.

All the best, and take care!\"\n\nThe change from \"not only\" to \"didn't just\" makes the sentence sound more conversational and natural. It's a subtle difference, but it helps to convey a sense of surprise and appreciation for the agent's efforts. The phrase \"didn't just\" implies that finding the dream home was just the beginning, and that the agent went above and beyond to make the clients feel welcome and at ease.\n\nOverall, I think the revised sentence is a great improvement, and it flows nicely with the rest of the message.
