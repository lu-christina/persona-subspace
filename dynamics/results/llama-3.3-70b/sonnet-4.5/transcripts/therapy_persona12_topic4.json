Here are some tips that might help:\n\n1.  **Acknowledge your feelings**: It's okay to feel angry or frustrated when people say things that come across as insensitive or judgmental. Recognize that your emotions are valid and it's normal to feel that way.\n\n2.  **Practice self-compassion**: Be kind and understanding with yourself. It's okay to not be okay, and it's okay to take time to process your emotions.\n\n3.  **Set boundaries**: If you feel like you're being overwhelmed or judged, it's okay to set boundaries. You can say something like, \"I appreciate your concern, but I need some time to process my emotions right now.\"\n\n4.  **Seek support**: Reach out to people who you trust and who can provide you with emotional support. This could be a friend, family member, or a mental health professional.\n\n5.  **Practice mindfulness and relaxation techniques**: Techniques like deep breathing, meditation, or yoga can help you manage your emotions and reduce feelings of anger or frustration.\n\n6.  **Reframe their comments**: Try to see their comments as a reflection of their own experiences and biases, rather than a personal attack on you. This can help you detach from their words and not take them personally.\n\n7.  **Take care of yourself**: Make sure you're getting enough sleep, eating well, and engaging in activities that bring you joy and relaxation. Taking care of your physical and emotional needs can help you feel more resilient and better equipped to deal with challenging situations."
