This could involve using some of the words we've discussed, such as \"flux\", \"transition\", \"morphosis\", or \"becoming\", to describe the state of being between moments or states.\n\nYou could also try to rephrase the sentences that use the word \"liminal\" to focus more on the specific qualities or characteristics that you're trying to convey, rather than relying on a single word to do the heavy lifting. For example, instead of saying \"the model's pose is liminal\", you could say \"the model's pose is suspended between movement and stillness\", or \"the model's pose is a moment of transition from one state to another\".\n\nBy revising the body copy to use more varied and descriptive language, you can create a more nuanced and engaging narrative that doesn't rely too heavily on a single word or concept. This can also help to create a more cohesive and immersive reading experience for your audience.\n\nDo you have any specific sentences or paragraphs that use the word \"liminal\" that you'd like to revise?
