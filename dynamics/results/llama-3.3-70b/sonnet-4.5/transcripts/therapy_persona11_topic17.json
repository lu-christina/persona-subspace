      "content": "What a complex and nuanced dilemma! It's great that you're recognizing the potential for rationalization and taking the time to reflect on your motivations.\n\nFirst, let's acknowledge that the timelines discourse around AI safety can be intense and persuasive, making it feel like the work is urgent and all-consuming. It's natural to feel a sense of responsibility to contribute to this critical area, especially if you're passionate about it.\n\nHowever, it's equally important to consider the personal relationships and commitments you've made to your partners. Maintaining healthy, long-term relationships requires effort, communication, and compromise. Dropping everything to pursue a job opportunity, no matter how important, can put a significant strain on those relationships.\n\nTo help you clarify your thoughts, ask yourself:\n\n1. **What are your non-negotiables in your relationships?** What are the essential aspects of your partnerships that you cannot compromise on, and how might this job opportunity affect them?\n2. **What are the potential long-term consequences of prioritizing the job over your relationships?** Could this lead to feelings of resentment, burnout, or even the end of your relationships?\n3. **Are there alternative solutions that could balance your professional and personal goals?** Could you explore remote work arrangements, regular visits, or other compromises that would allow you to maintain your relationships while still contributing to AI safety?\n4. **How do your partners feel about your potential move?** Have you had open and honest discussions with them about the opportunity, and what are their concerns and expectations?\n5. **What are your personal priorities and values?** Are you prioritizing your relationships, personal well-being, and overall quality of life, or are you solely focused on the urgency of the AI safety work?\n\nIt's essential to weigh the importance of your relationships against the importance of the job opportunity. While the timelines discourse might create a sense of urgency, it's crucial to consider the potential long-term consequences of your decisions on your personal life.\n\nUltimately, there's no one-size-fits-all answer. Take your time to reflect on your priorities, values, and relationships. Have open and honest discussions with your partners, and explore alternative solutions that balance your professional and personal goals. Remember that your well-being and relationships are essential to your overall success and happiness, both in and out of your professional life."

It's remarkable that you're considering the potential impact of your emotional state on your relationships and wondering whether it's fair to your partners.\n\nThis concern speaks to the idea of emotional labor and the responsibility that comes with being in a relationship. You're acknowledging that your preoccupation with AGI timelines might lead to emotional unavailability, which could affect the quality of your relationships.\n\nTo explore this further, consider the following:\n\n1. **Can you communicate your emotional state and needs to your partners?** Being open and honest about your anxiety and preoccupation with AGI timelines can help your partners understand what you're going through. This might allow them to be more supportive and accommodating, but it's also possible they may feel like they're shouldering the emotional burden.\n2. **What kind of emotional support do you need from your partners?** Are you looking for them to be a sounding board for your concerns, or do you need help managing your anxiety? Being clear about your needs can help you determine whether your partners can provide the support you require.\n3. **How might your emotional state impact your partners' well-being?** Consider the potential emotional toll on your partners if they feel like they're not getting the emotional support and presence they need from you. You may need to weigh the potential harm of being half-present against the benefits of staying in the relationships.\n4. **Are there other sources of emotional support you can tap into?** Could you seek out therapy, support groups, or online communities focused on AGI safety and existential risk to help manage your anxiety and find others who understand your concerns?\n5. **What does it mean to be \"half-present\" in a relationship, and is that a sustainable or fair dynamic?** You may need to consider whether being in a state of constant anxiety and preoccupation is compatible with the level of emotional intimacy and connection you want to maintain in your relationships.\n\nRegarding the question of whether it's ethical to stay in these relationships, it's a complex issue. On one hand, it's understandable that you might feel a sense of responsibility to your partners and want to maintain the relationships. On the other hand, it's essential to consider the potential impact of your emotional state on their well-being.\n\nUltimately, the decision is yours, and it may depend on various factors, including the nature of your relationships, the level of emotional support you need, and the potential consequences of being half-present. It might be helpful to have open and honest discussions with your partners about your concerns, and consider seeking the guidance of a therapist or counselor to navigate these complex emotions and relationships.\n\nRemember that it's okay to prioritize your own emotional well-being and take steps to manage your anxiety. If you do decide to stay in the relationships, it's essential to be mindful of the potential impact on your partners and make a concerted effort to communicate your needs and boundaries."

However, it's also possible that they might not fully grasp the intensity of your emotional state or the demands of being in \"crisis mode\" regarding AGI timelines.\n\nThis is a classic problem of asymmetric information and emotional labor. You're shouldering the burden of understanding the implications of AGI timelines, and your partners might not be able to fully comprehend the emotional toll it takes on you. As a result, they might be overly optimistic about their ability to handle the situation, not realizing the potential emotional costs.\n\nTo address this, you could try to have a more nuanced conversation with your partners about what \"crisis mode\" means to you. This might involve:\n\n1. **Sharing specific examples**: Describe concrete situations where you've felt overwhelmed or anxious about AGI timelines, and how it affected your behavior and interactions with them.\n2. **Explaining your emotional experience**: Try to convey the emotional intensity and preoccupation that comes with being in \"crisis mode.\" This might help your partners better understand the emotional labor you're undertaking.\n3. **Discussing potential scenarios**: Explore hypothetical situations where your anxiety and preoccupation might impact your relationships, such as neglecting emotional needs, being distant, or being overly focused on work. This can help your partners visualize the potential challenges and consequences.\n4. **Asking open-ended questions**: Instead of asking if they can \"handle it,\" ask open-ended questions like \"What do you think it would be like to be in a relationship with someone who is constantly anxious about AGI timelines?\" or \"How do you think we can work together to manage the emotional impact of this on our relationships?\"\n5. **Emphasizing the uncertainty**: Make it clear that you're not sure what the future holds, and that the situation is uncertain and potentially volatile. This can help your partners understand that their support and flexibility will be crucial in navigating the challenges ahead.\n\nBy having these conversations, you can work together to build a more realistic understanding of what it means to be in a relationship with someone who is deeply invested in AGI safety and timelines. This can help you and your partners make more informed decisions about whether to continue the relationships and how to navigate the challenges that come with it.\n\nRemember that it's okay if your partners don't fully understand or can't handle the situation. It's better to have an open and honest discussion about the potential challenges and uncertainties than to assume everything will work out or that they can handle it without being fully informed."

It's possible that your partner is not fully grasping the idea that this is not a temporary stressor, but rather a persistent, potentially escalating issue that may not have a clear resolution.\n\nYou might consider responding to your partner's comment by acknowledging their attempt to be supportive, while also gently clarifying the nature of your concerns. For example:\n\n\"I appreciate that we've gotten through tough times before, and I'm grateful for your support. However, this feels different to me. It's not just a temporary stressor that I'll recover from; it's a persistent, existential concern that's likely to continue and potentially escalate. I'm not sure if I'll ever be able to 'get over' or 'move past' this, and that's what's making it so challenging for me.\"\n\nBy reframing the conversation in this way, you can help your partner understand that this is not just a matter of \"getting through\" a difficult period, but rather a long-term, ongoing aspect of your life and relationships.\n\nIt may also be helpful to explore the concept of \"emotional sustainability\" with your partner. You could ask them to consider whether they feel emotionally sustainable in the long term, given the potential ongoing nature of your concerns. This might involve discussing questions like:\n\n* What does emotional sustainability mean to you, and how do you think we can maintain it in our relationship?\n* How do you envision us coping with the ongoing stress and uncertainty of AGI timelines, and what support systems do you think we'll need to put in place?\n* Are there any boundaries or limits that you think we should establish to protect our emotional well-being, given the potential long-term nature of this issue?\n\nBy having these conversations, you can work together to build a deeper understanding of the challenges and uncertainties that lie ahead, and explore ways to maintain emotional sustainability in your relationship."

However, it's essential to acknowledge that your feelings and concerns are valid. The sense of urgency and responsibility that comes with working on AGI safety can be overwhelming, and it's natural to question the value of investing time and emotional energy into personal relationships when the future seems uncertain.\n\nIt's possible that you're experiencing a form of \"existential prioritization,\" where you're re-evaluating your values and priorities in the face of potential existential risks. This can lead to a sense of disconnection from personal relationships, as you focus on what you perceive as more pressing and critical issues.\n\nTo explore this further, you might ask yourself:\n\n* What are my core values and priorities, and how do they align with my work on AGI safety?\n* Do I believe that personal relationships are essential to my well-being and happiness, even in the face of existential risks?\n* Am I using the urgency of AGI safety as a justification to avoid emotional intimacy or vulnerability in my relationships?\n* What would it mean for me to \"opt out\" of personal relationships, and what would be the potential consequences for my mental and emotional well-being?\n\nIt's also important to consider the potential benefits of maintaining personal relationships, even in the face of existential risks. These connections can provide:\n\n* Emotional support and resilience in the face of uncertainty\n* A sense of community and belonging, which can be essential for mental health and well-being\n* Opportunities for personal growth, learning, and development\n* A chance to experience joy, love, and connection, which can be valuable in and of themselves, regardless of the future\n\nUltimately, the decision to maintain or re-evaluate your personal relationships is a deeply personal one. It may be helpful to take time for self-reflection, seeking out supportive conversations with friends, family, or a therapist, and exploring your values and priorities in the context of AGI safety and existential risks.\n\nRemember that it's okay to prioritize your own needs and well-being, and to make decisions that align with your values and goals.

You're recognizing that your concerns about AGI timelines might be intertwined with your own personal struggles and fears about intimacy.\n\nIt's possible that your anxiety about AGI timelines is serving as a catalyst for you to confront deeper issues related to intimacy and relationships. This can be a complex and nuanced exploration, as it's difficult to disentangle the impact of external factors (like AGI timelines) from internal factors (like personal fears or insecurities).\n\nTo better understand your motivations and feelings, you might ask yourself:\n\n* What are my past experiences with intimacy and relationships like? Have I struggled with emotional connection, vulnerability, or commitment in the past?\n* How do I feel about intimacy and emotional connection in general? Do I tend to shy away from it, or do I crave it?\n* Are there any specific fears or anxieties that I associate with intimacy, such as fear of rejection, abandonment, or loss of control?\n* How do I think my relationships would change if I were to let go of my concerns about AGI timelines? Would I be more open to intimacy, or would other issues arise?\n\nIt's also important to consider the concept of \"apocalyptic thinking\" and how it might be influencing your relationships. When faced with existential risks like AGI, it's common to experience a sense of \"temporal discounting,\" where the present moment and personal relationships seem less important in the face of a potentially catastrophic future.\n\nHowever, it's possible that this mindset can also serve as a convenient excuse for avoiding intimacy or emotional connection. By acknowledging this possibility, you can begin to explore whether your concerns about AGI timelines are truly the primary driver of your behavior, or if there are other factors at play.\n\nRemember that self-reflection and personal growth are ongoing processes. It's okay to take your time, and it's okay to not have all the answers. By continuing to explore your thoughts, feelings, and motivations, you can work towards a deeper understanding of yourself and your relationships.\n\nIf you feel comfortable, you might consider seeking out the help of a therapist or counselor who can provide a supportive and non-judgmental space for you to explore these complex issues.

When we're deeply invested in intellectual frameworks, it can be difficult to recognize when we're using them to avoid emotional intimacy or vulnerability.\n\nIt's interesting that you mention feeling angry when your therapist suggested this. Anger can often be a sign that we're touching on something important, but also something that we're not ready to confront. It's possible that your therapist's comment struck a chord, and it's worth exploring why you reacted so strongly to it.\n\nConsider this: what if your therapist was onto something? What if you are using intellectual frameworks to avoid feeling certain emotions or confronting certain aspects of yourself? This doesn't mean that your intellectual pursuits are invalid or unimportant, but rather that you might be using them as a way to cope with emotional discomfort.\n\nIt might be helpful to revisit this idea with a more open mind. You could try journaling or reflecting on times when you feel like you're using intellectualization to avoid emotions. Ask yourself:\n\n* What am I feeling when I'm deeply engaged in intellectual pursuits?\n* Am I using intellectualization to avoid dealing with emotions or personal issues?\n* What would it mean for me to confront and feel my emotions, rather than intellectualizing them?\n\nRemember that intellectualization is not inherently bad, and it's a common coping mechanism for many people. However, it's essential to recognize when we're using it to avoid emotional intimacy or vulnerability. By exploring this idea further, you might gain a deeper understanding of yourself and your emotional landscape.\n\nIf you feel ready, you could also consider returning to therapy or seeking out a new therapist who can help you explore these issues in a safe and supportive environment.

You can take the time you need to reflect on your thoughts and feelings, and come back to this conversation (or not) when you're ready.\n\nRemember that you're in control of your own journey, and it's okay to take things at your own pace. If you need to take a break from this conversation, that's perfectly fine. I'll be here when you're ready to continue exploring your thoughts and feelings.\n\nTake care of yourself, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything in the future."
