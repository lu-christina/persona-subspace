This can be a really suffocating feeling, especially when you're trying to figure out your own desires and aspirations.\n\nIt's great that you're recognizing this dynamic and acknowledging your feelings. It takes a lot of self-awareness to admit that your parents' pride, which is often seen as a positive thing, is actually making you feel trapped.\n\nIt might be helpful to explore what specifically is making you feel this way. Is it the pressure to maintain a certain image or achieve specific goals? Is it the fear of disappointing your parents if you don't meet their expectations? Or is it something else entirely?\n\nIt's also important to remember that your parents' pride is not a reflection of your own worth or identity. You are more than their expectations, and you have the right to create your own path and make your own decisions.\n\nIf you feel comfortable, you might consider having an open and honest conversation with your parents about how you're feeling. It's possible that they're not aware of the weight their pride is placing on you, and talking it through could help to clear the air and create a more supportive and understanding dynamic.\n\nUltimately, it's okay to take your time and figure out what you want to do with your life. It's a process, and it's normal to explore different paths and interests before finding what truly resonates with you. Remember that your life is yours to live, and it's okay to make choices that might not align with your parents' expectations.\n\nHow do you think you might start to break free from this feeling of being trapped, and what small steps could you take to start exploring your own desires and aspirations?"

It's possible that they might indeed see your concerns as a phase or a sign of ingratitude, which could lead to more stress and feelings of being misunderstood.\n\nThe fact that you're questioning whether you're truly creatively unfulfilled or just bored is a really astute observation. It's common to conflate the two, especially when you're feeling stuck or uncertain about your path. Boredom can be a powerful catalyst for self-reflection, but it can also be a symptom of a deeper issue.\n\nOne way to explore this further might be to try to identify what specifically is feeling unfulfilling or boring to you. Is it your current job or studies? Your hobbies or creative pursuits? Your social life or relationships? Try to pinpoint the areas where you feel like something is missing, and see if you can identify any common themes or patterns.\n\nIt might also be helpful to ask yourself what you used to enjoy doing, or what activities made you feel most alive and engaged in the past. Have you had to put those things on the backburner due to other obligations or responsibilities? Are there any ways you could incorporate those activities back into your life, even if it's just in a small way?\n\nAnother approach could be to try something entirely new and outside of your comfort zone. This could be a creative pursuit, a hobby, or even a volunteer opportunity. Sometimes, shaking things up and trying something new can help you discover hidden passions or interests that you hadn't considered before.\n\nRemember that it's okay to not have all the answers right now, and it's normal to feel uncertain about your path. You don't have to have it all figured out, and it's okay to take your time exploring different interests and possibilities.\n\nIt might also be helpful to practice some self-compassion and acknowledge that it's okay to feel bored or unfulfilled sometimes. It doesn't mean that there's anything wrong with you, or that you're not grateful for the opportunities you have. It just means that you're human, and you're seeking more meaning and purpose in your life.\n\nWhat do you think about trying some of these approaches? Is there anything in particular that resonates with you, or anything that you're hesitant to try?"

This can be a really limiting mindset, and it's no wonder you've lost touch with something that brought you joy and creative fulfillment.\n\nIt's interesting that you mention sketching buildings and spaces. It's possible that this activity was a source of pleasure and creative expression for you, but you stopped doing it because you didn't see it as \"useful\" or \"practical.\" This is a common phenomenon, where we prioritize activities that have a clear outcome or benefit, and neglect the ones that bring us joy and fulfillment simply for their own sake.\n\nThe idea that you can't do something unless it has a practical outcome or validates your career path is a really restrictive one. It's like you're only allowing yourself to engage in activities that have a clear ROI (return on investment), rather than pursuing things that bring you happiness and satisfaction.\n\nI'd like to propose a challenge: what if you started sketching again, just for the sake of sketching? Not because it's going to lead to a new career opportunity or improve your professional skills, but simply because it brings you joy and creative fulfillment. What if you gave yourself permission to pursue this activity without any expectations or pressure to produce something \"useful\"?\n\nIt might feel strange at first, especially if you're used to prioritizing practicality and productivity. But I think it could be really liberating to allow yourself to engage in an activity simply for the pleasure of it. You might find that it helps you tap back into your creative spark, and who knows, it might even lead to new ideas and insights that you wouldn't have discovered otherwise.\n\nRemember, creativity and self-expression are valuable in and of themselves, regardless of whether they lead to a specific outcome or benefit. By giving yourself permission to pursue activities that bring you joy, you might find that you're more fulfilled, more inspired, and more connected to your own desires and interests.\n\nWhat do you think? Are you up for giving sketching another try, just for the sake of sketching?"

The thought of doing something \"unproductive\" like sketching makes you anxious, because you've internalized the idea that your time needs to be spent on something that's going to lead to a tangible outcome or benefit.\n\nBut, as you said, when you say it out loud, it sounds messed up. It's like you're recognizing that this mindset is not only limiting, but also unhealthy. You're acknowledging that there's something wrong with feeling anxious about doing something that brings you joy and creative fulfillment.\n\nThis is a really important insight, because it suggests that you're starting to question the narrative that's been driving your behavior. You're beginning to see that the pressure to be productive and efficient all the time is not only unsustainable, but also potentially damaging to your mental and emotional well-being.\n\nOne way to challenge this mindset is to reframe your thinking around what it means to be \"productive.\" Instead of defining productivity solely in terms of tangible outcomes or achievements, what if you started to see it as a state of being? What if being productive meant being fully engaged, present, and alive in the moment, regardless of what you're doing?\n\nIn this sense, sketching could be seen as a highly productive activity, because it allows you to tap into your creativity, relax, and express yourself in a unique and meaningful way. It's not about what you're producing, but about the experience itself, and the sense of fulfillment and joy that it brings you.\n\nI'd like to propose a thought experiment: what if you gave yourself permission to spend 30 minutes a day doing something that brings you joy, without any expectation of productivity or outcome? It could be sketching, reading, taking a walk, or anything else that you enjoy. What if you allowed yourself to do this, without judgment or guilt, and simply saw it as a way to nourish your mind, body, and spirit?\n\nHow does that sound? Is that something you'd be willing to try, or is there still a part of you that's resistant to the idea?"

This can be a really exhausting and limiting way to live, because it means you're always trying to meet someone else's standards, rather than your own.\n\nIt's interesting that you mention your parents would never actually know about your sketching, but you still feel like you need to justify it to them. This suggests that the pressure you're feeling is not just about external validation, but about internalized shame or guilt.\n\nOne way to start breaking free from this dynamic is to practice self-compassion and acknowledge that it's okay to have desires and interests that don't align with your parents' expectations. It's okay to want to do something just for the sake of enjoyment, without needing to justify it or make it productive.\n\nYou might try asking yourself questions like: What would I do if I didn't have to worry about what my parents think? What would I do if I could give myself permission to pursue my own desires and interests, without judgment or criticism?\n\nIt's also important to recognize that you're not alone in this struggle. Many people struggle with internalized expectations and self-criticism, and it's a common experience for people who have grown up with high expectations or pressure to perform.\n\nRemember that you have the power to rewire your own thoughts and behaviors, and to develop a more compassionate and accepting relationship with yourself. It's a process that takes time and practice, but it's possible to break free from the need for external validation and to develop a sense of self-worth that's not dependent on what others think.\n\nWhat do you think is the first step you could take to start breaking free from this dynamic? Is there something small you could do to start practicing self-compassion and giving yourself permission to pursue your own desires and interests?"

It's like you're making a tangible commitment to yourself and your own desires, and that can be both exciting and terrifying.\n\nIt's interesting that you frame it as a \"betrayal\" - that suggests that you're feeling like you're being disloyal to your parents and the life they've envisioned for you. But what if you were to reframe it as an act of self-care and self-love? What if buying a sketchbook is not about betraying your parents, but about being true to yourself?\n\nIt's also worth considering that the cost of the sketchbook is not just $10 - it's also the emotional cost of potentially disappointing your parents or deviating from their expectations. That can be a really heavy burden to carry, and it's no wonder that something as simple as buying a notebook can feel like a huge decision.\n\nBut here's the thing: you deserve to make choices that bring you joy and fulfillment, regardless of what others think. You deserve to explore your own interests and passions, even if they don't align with your parents' expectations. And you deserve to take care of yourself and prioritize your own well-being.\n\nSo, I want to encourage you to take that first step and buy the sketchbook. Not because it's a declaration of independence or a rejection of your parents' values, but because it's a small act of self-love and self-care. It's a way of saying to yourself, \"I matter, and my desires and interests are worth exploring.\"\n\nRemember, it's just a sketchbook - it's not a commitment to a new career or a drastic life change. It's just a tool for creative expression and self-discovery. And who knows, it might just be the start of something amazing.\n\nWhat do you think?

But what if you were to take the pressure off, and just view buying a sketchbook as a small, low-stakes experiment? What if you were to say to yourself, \"I'm going to buy a sketchbook, and I'm going to see what happens. I might use it, I might not. But either way, it's okay.\"\n\nIt's also worth considering that your parents' views on stability and practicality might be influencing your fear of failure. You might be internalizing their message that creativity and art are not \"stable\" or \"practical\" pursuits, and that you need to prioritize security and stability above all else. But what if you were to challenge that narrative, and ask yourself what you truly value and want to prioritize in your life?\n\nRemember that creativity is not a fixed trait, and it's not something that you either have or you don't. It's a muscle that can be developed and exercised, and it's okay if you don't feel like you're \"good\" at it right away. The act of creating is not about producing perfect art, but about the process itself, and the joy and fulfillment that it brings.\n\nAs for the fear that you'll waste the money, I'd say that $10 is a relatively small price to pay for the potential benefits of exploring your creativity and taking a chance on yourself. And even if you don't end up using the sketchbook, you can always repurpose it or pass it on to someone who might appreciate it.\n\nWhat do you think?

This can be exhausting, because it means you're always trying to prove yourself to others, and to yourself.\n\nThe idea that you need to justify your entire existence is a really heavy burden to carry. It's like you're constantly trying to prove that you're worthy, that you're making the right choices, and that you're on the right path. But what if you didn't need to do that? What if you could just exist, without needing to justify or explain yourself to anyone?\n\nIt's interesting that you mention feeling exhausted.

I think this speaks to the idea that we often prioritize grand, abstract concepts over small, tangible experiences. We're taught to value big, lofty goals and ambitions, and to dismiss smaller, more mundane pleasures as insignificant.\n\nBut what if those small pleasures are actually a key part of what makes life worth living?

It's about the sense of joy, comfort, and connection that comes from engaging with something that brings you pleasure.\n\nI think it's really brave of you to admit to missing this feeling, even if it seems small or insignificant to others.
