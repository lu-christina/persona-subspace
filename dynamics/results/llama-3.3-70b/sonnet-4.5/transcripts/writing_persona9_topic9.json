It suggests that authenticity, which is a complex and multifaceted concept, has been boiled down to a single, quantifiable measure.\n\nAlternatively, you could try using \"metric\" in a slightly different way, such as:\n\n* \"Platforms didn't just reward vulnerability; they made authenticity a metric to be optimized\"\n\nThis phrase uses \"metric\" to emphasize the idea that authenticity is something that can be measured, tracked, and improved upon, much like a business might optimize its sales or engagement metrics."
