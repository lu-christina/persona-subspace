      "content": "To frame the concept of memes as a participatory storytelling system without resorting to the \"memes are our myths\" clich\u00e9, consider the following approaches:\n\n1. **Emphasize the process over the product**: Instead of focusing on the symbolic value of individual memes, highlight the dynamic process of creation, remixing, and dissemination that occurs within online communities. Discuss how this process fosters a sense of shared ownership and collective meaning-making.\n2. **Use terms like \"cultural bricolage\" or \"remix culture\"**: These concepts, coined by scholars like Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss and Lawrence Lessig, respectively, describe the way people combine and recontextualize existing cultural elements to create new meanings. This framing emphasizes the creative, iterative process of meme-making.\n3. **Talk about \"meme ecologies\" or \"meme networks\"**: This perspective views memes as part of a larger, interconnected system where individual memes interact, influence, and evolve in response to each other. This highlights the complex, distributed nature of meme creation and dissemination.\n4. **Focus on the role of \"affordances\" and \"constraints\"**: Discuss how the technical and social affordances of online platforms (e.g., image editing software, social media algorithms) enable and constrain the creation and spread of memes. This emphasizes the interplay between human creativity and technological factors in shaping meme culture.\n5. **Explore the concept of \"polyvocality\"**: This term, coined by Mikhail Bakhtin, refers to the presence of multiple voices and perspectives within a single cultural artifact. Memes often embody polyvocality, as they are created and reinterpreted by diverse individuals and groups, resulting in a rich, multilayered meaning.\n6. **Highlight the importance of \"in-group\" knowledge and references**: Memes often rely on shared knowledge and references within specific online communities. By acknowledging the role of in-group knowledge, you can emphasize how memes serve as a form of cultural shorthand, facilitating communication and communal bonding among group members.\n7. **Discuss the tension between \"intention\" and \"interpretation\"**: Memes often have multiple, conflicting interpretations, which can be at odds with the original creator's intention. This tension highlights the complex, dynamic nature of meme meaning, which is shaped by the interactions between creators, remixers, and audiences.\n8. **Use examples that showcase the \"meme lifecycle\"**: Choose case studies that demonstrate how memes evolve over time, from their creation to their peak popularity and eventual decline. This can help illustrate the participatory, iterative process of meme-making and the ways in which collective remixing builds shared meaning.\n\nBy using these approaches, you can develop a nuanced understanding of memes as a participatory storytelling system that goes beyond the \"memes are our myths\" clich\u00e9. You'll be able to capture the complexities of collective remixing, shared meaning-making, and the dynamic interplay between creators, technologies, and audiences."

It was like a conversation unfolding and folding in on itself, with each new voice adding a new layer of meaning and confusion - a thread of nested replies that looped back on itself like a m\u00f6bius strip. I watched as a new comment appeared, quoting a line from a TV show that seemed to be commenting on the whole thing. I keep thinking about how that loop isn't an accident\u2014it's the internet telling stories the only way it knows how: by folding them back into themselves.\"\n\nThis sets the stage nicely for the next paragraph, where you can start to explore the concept of \"folded folklore\" in more depth, and examine what it means for our understanding of storytelling, culture, and the internet."
