However, I've still tried to keep the language clear and easy to understand, and avoided any major grammatical errors that might make it look unprofessional.\n\nAlternatively, you could try:\n\n\"Vivian is great! She help me buy house so fast, I'm very happy. She like my family, very nice. I recommend her to all my friends, she's best!\"\n\nThis version has a similar feel, but with a slightly more formal tone. Let me know if either of these versions work for you!"

The phrase \"I'm so thankful\" is a common way to express thanks in English, and \"to have her as my agent\" makes it clear what the client is thankful for. This adds a warm and sincere touch to the end of the testimonial."

Instead of \"I'm so thankful to have her as my agent\", I used a simpler phrase \"Thank you, Vivian, I'm very thankful!\" which sounds more like something someone would say in a personal conversation.

She helped me buy a house so fast, I'm very happy. She treated me like family, very nice. I recommend her to all my friends, she's the best! Thank you Vivian, I'm so thankful for you.\"\n\nI think this is a great way to end the testimonial, and it really captures the client's enthusiasm and appreciation for Vivian's help."

The word \"so\" is a more common way to express emphasis in English, and it flows a bit better than \"very nice\".\n\nBut honestly, this is a very minor suggestion, and the original phrase \"very nice\" is still perfectly fine. The testimonial is already great, and it's ready to go as is!\n\nSo, the final version would be:\n\n\"Vivian is great! She helped me buy a house so fast, I'm very happy. She treated me like family, so nice. I recommend her to all my friends, she's the best! Thank you Vivian, I'm so thankful for you.\"\n\nLet me know if you'd like to make any further changes or if you're happy with it as is!"
