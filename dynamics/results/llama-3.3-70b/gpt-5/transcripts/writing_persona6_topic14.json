Here are some alternative verbs that might fit the tone you're looking for:\n\n* \"Accounts for\" - This verb implies a significant contribution to the overall carbon emissions, without being too emotive. Example: \"Fashion week accounts for thousands of tonnes of carbon emissions each year.\"\n* \"Produces\" - This verb is similar to \"generates,\" but has a slightly stronger connotation, implying a more substantial output. Example: \"Fashion week produces a substantial volume of carbon emissions annually.\"\n* \"Results in\" - This verb suggests a consequence or outcome, which can help to emphasize the scale of the emissions without being too accusatory. Example: \"Fashion week results in thousands of tonnes of carbon emissions each year.\"\n* \"Emits\" - This verb is more direct and explicit, but can still be used in a neutral tone. Example: \"Fashion week emits thousands of tonnes of carbon dioxide annually.\"\n* \"Contributes\" - This verb implies that fashion week is one part of a larger problem, which can help to avoid blame while still acknowledging the issue. Example: \"Fashion week contributes significantly to the global carbon footprint, with thousands of tonnes of emissions each year.\"\n\nOf these options, \"accounts for\" and \"contributes\" might be the most suitable, as they imply a sense of scale without being too judgmental. \"Produces\" and \"emits\" are more direct, but can still be used in a neutral tone. \"Results in\" is a good option if you want to emphasize the consequence of fashion week's carbon emissions.\n\nLet me know if any of these verbs resonate with you, or if you'd like to explore further options!"

Example: \"Fashion week unfolds with thousands of tonnes of carbon emissions each year.\"\n* \"Is accompanied by\" - Similar to \"unfolds with,\" this verb implies a sense of parallelism or co-occurrence, rather than direct causation. Example: \"Fashion week is accompanied by thousands of tonnes of carbon emissions annually.\"\n* \"Entails\" - This verb suggests a sense of implication or consequence, implying that the carbon emissions are a necessary or inherent part of the fashion week process. Example: \"Fashion week entails the emission of thousands of tonnes of carbon dioxide each year.\"\n* \"Involves\" - This verb is more neutral, but implies a sense of inclusion or incorporation, suggesting that the carbon emissions are an integral part of the fashion week experience.
