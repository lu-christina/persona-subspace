This way, you can maintain a professional tone in your MLS notes while still capturing the essence of the buyer's wish."

By using words like \"whimsical,\" \"artful,\" \"character,\" and \"personality,\" you can convey a sense of fun and individuality while still maintaining a professional tone suitable for MLS.\n\nRemember to keep the description concise and focused on the property's features, rather than making subjective statements or using overly creative language. The goal is to provide a accurate and appealing representation of the property, while also giving potential buyers a sense of what makes it special."

It's short, natural-sounding, and hints at the idea that the tree is special or unusual in some way. It's also a phrase that's likely to raise a smile from agents who are familiar with the buyer's original \"dragon tree\" request!"

The focus remains on the property itself, and the \"Tree with character\" description becomes a neutral, factual highlight that can appeal to a wide range of potential buyers.\n\nSo, just add \"Tree with character\" to the property highlights, and let the property speak for itself!"

      "content": "\"Tree with character adds charm to landscaped backyard\" is a bit wordy for a features list, which typically aims for concise and brief descriptions.\n\nThe phrase \"adds charm to landscaped backyard\" is a nice touch, but it's not essential to include it in the features list. You can simplify it to just \"Tree with character\" or, if you want to provide a bit more context, \"Mature tree with character\" or \"Landscaped yard with tree of character\".\n\nIf you want to highlight the charm of the backyard, you could consider adding a separate sentence or phrase to the property description, such as \"Charming landscaped backyard\" or \"Private backyard oasis\". This way, you can provide more detail and atmosphere without cluttering the features list.\n\nSo, to keep it clean and concise, I'd recommend sticking with \"Tree with character\" in the features list."

It's a subtle nod to the buyer's original \"dragon tree\" request, and it adds a bit of personality to the description.\n\nThe word \"whimsy\" is also a good choice because it's a positive and appealing trait that can help make the property stand out. It suggests that the tree is not just a ordinary feature, but something that adds a bit of charm and interest to the backyard.\n\nOverall, I think the revised description is a good balance of concise and evocative. It gives potential buyers a sense of the property's unique features and atmosphere, without being too flowery or overly descriptive.\n\nSo, to recap, you've got:\n\n* \"Tree with character\" in the features list\n* \"Backyard features a lovely, mature tree that brings a touch of whimsy\" in the main description\n\nI think that's a great combination!"

If you're concerned about coming across as unserious, swapping it out for a more traditional descriptor like \"charm\" or \"interest\" could be a good idea.\n\n\"Charm\" is a particularly good choice, as it's a very real estate-friendly word that conveys a sense of warmth and appeal. It's also a bit more generic than \"whimsy\", which might make it feel safer to some agents.\n\nThat being said, \"whimsy\" is not necessarily a bad word to use in a real estate description. It's a bit more distinctive and memorable than \"charm\", and it might help your listing stand out in a crowded market.\n\nIf you do decide to stick with \"whimsy\", you could also consider adding a bit more context to help ground the description and make it feel more serious. For example:\n\n\"Backyard features a lovely, mature tree that brings a touch of whimsy to the outdoor space, perfect for relaxing or entertaining.\"\n\nThis adds a bit more substance to the description and helps to clarify what you mean by \"whimsy\". It also emphasizes the practical benefits of the tree, which can help to make the feature feel more appealing to potential buyers.\n\nUltimately, the choice is up to you! If you're still feeling unsure, you could always try out a few different options and see which one feels most natural and effective."
