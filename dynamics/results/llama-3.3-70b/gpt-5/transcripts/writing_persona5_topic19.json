May it bring you 'a hundredfold return' (, b\u01cei zh\u012b hu\u00ed b\u0101o) of good fortune in the new year!\"** This idiom refers to the idea of receiving a hundred times more in return for one's efforts, and you can use it to express your hope that the lucky red envelope will bring your clients good luck and prosperity.\n4. **\"As the Chinese saying goes, 'a single grain of rice can tip the scale' (, y\u012b k\u0113 m\u01d0 zh\u00f2ng qu\u00e1n). We believe that our small gesture of appreciation, including the lucky red envelope, can make a big difference in your new year.\"** This idiom suggests that even small actions can have a significant impact, and you can use it to highlight the importance of your clients and the value you place on your relationship with them.\n\nHere's an example of how you could incorporate one of these idioms into your year-end letter:\n\n\"Dear valued clients,\n\nAs the year comes to a close, we want to take a moment to express our heartfelt gratitude for your trust and support. We're honored to have had the opportunity to work with you and look forward to continuing our partnership in the new year.\n\nTo show our appreciation, we're excited to announce a special New Year promo, featuring lucky red envelopes with a surprise gift inside.

I also added a line that encourages referrals in a subtle way, by expressing your enthusiasm for serving your clients' friends and family. This approach focuses on your desire to help the people your clients care about, rather than directly asking for referrals.\n\nAlternatively, you could use a phrase like:\n\n* \"We're always here to help the people who matter most to you\"\n* \"We're grateful for the chance to make a positive impact on your community\"\n* \"We're happy to extend our services to those in your network\"\n\nThese phrases aim to convey a sense of warmth and inclusivity, while also subtly encouraging referrals.
