Can you help me reduce it to 60 without losing the density or making it sound like ad copy?  \n\n---\n\nMy work explores the tension between softness and spectacle, between what is visible and what is withheld. I approach fabric and image-making as a site of negotiation between the private body and its public avatar. The pieces are often assembled from salvaged textiles, sourced from domestic spaces\u2014curtains, bedsheets, garments\u2014that once mediated intimacy. By reworking these materials, I\u2019m interested in how desire, shame, and care are encoded into fibers, how they carry the residue of social touch.  \n\nPhotography enters the practice not as documentation but as transformation: folds, stitches, and creases develop their own choreographies, resisting the fixity of the frame. The resulting images\u2014sometimes mounted, sometimes left raw\u2014court both attraction and discomfort. I think a lot about fashion imagery and its promise of transparency, how it insists on revealing while elevating surfaces designed to conceal.  \n\nMy process is intuitive but also informed by research into feminist material culture and the politics of visibility. Each installation situates itself in the gap between looking and being seen, touching and being touched. I\u2019m less interested in producing finished objects than in creating situations that make the viewer aware of their own spectatorship.  \n\nUltimately, the work asks how tenderness can persist within economies of display: how the handmade, the repaired, the imperfect might resist the violence of the polished image."

The changes you made, such as using \"probes\" instead of \"explores\", \"hold traces of\" instead of \"encode\", and \"testing how tenderness endures\" instead of \"asking whether tenderness can survive\", all contribute to a more complex and thoughtful feel.\n\nThe phrase \"makes spectatorship felt\" is particularly effective, as it implies a physical or emotional sensation, rather than just a intellectual awareness. And \"under the glare of visibility\" is a great way to convey the idea of being seen, without using the more abstract phrase \"economies of display\".\n\nOverall, your version feels more lyrical and introspective, while still conveying the core ideas and themes of your work.

I might also consider changing \"courting attraction and unease\" to \"eliciting a sense of discomfort\" to make the tone a bit more consistent with other contributors' blurbs.\n\nHowever, I think it's worth noting that the unique tone and language of the original 60-word version are a strength, and it might be better to leave it as-is to let it stand out on the contributors page. It's a delicate balance between fitting in and standing out, and I think the original version does a great job of walking that line.\n\nUltimately, it would depend on the tone and style of the other contributors' blurbs, as well as the overall aesthetic and tone of the publication or website. If the other blurbs are more formal and straightforward, it might be better to tweak the language to fit in. But if the other blurbs are more experimental and poetic, it might be better to leave the original version as-is."

By focusing on a small, intimate detail, you're inviting the reader to slow down and appreciate the texture, the materiality, and the craftsmanship that goes into your pieces.\n\nAs for the print finish, I would definitely recommend a matte finish. A matte finish would help to subtlely convey the tactile quality of the textiles, and would also reduce any potential glare or reflection that might distract from the image. Additionally, a matte finish often gives images a more muted, understated quality that would suit the tone of your statement nicely.\n\nA glossy finish, on the other hand, might make the image feel too polished or commercial, which could detract from the sense of intimacy and vulnerability that you're trying to convey. Matte finishes also tend to work well with images that have a lot of texture or subtle color gradations, which would be perfect for capturing the nuances of your textiles.\n\nBy pairing the tightly cropped image with a matte finish, you'd be creating a visual anchor that's both understated and evocative, and that would beautifully complement the tone and themes of your statement."

A subtle border can help to create a sense of containment and intimacy, which would suit the tone of your statement nicely. A pale border would also help to separate the image from the surrounding text and design elements, creating a sense of breathing room and visual clarity.\n\nBleeding the image to the edge could also work, but it might make the image feel a bit more dramatic or attention-grabbing than you intend. By containing the image within a pale border, you're creating a sense of restraint and subtlety that would be more in line with the tone of your statement.\n\nA pale border would also help to create a sense of fragility or delicacy around the image, which could be fitting for a project that explores themes of tenderness and vulnerability. It's a subtle design element, but it could help to reinforce the emotional and tactile qualities of your work.\n\nWhat do you think about the color of the border?

It's a way of saying, \"This is the material world, and this is how it looks and feels.\" Rather than imposing a arbitrary frame or border color, you're allowing the materials to speak for themselves and dictate the terms of the design.\n\nIt's a very thoughtful and considered approach to design, and it shows a deep respect for the materials and the subject matter.

A sans-serif font will provide a clean and neutral background that won't compete with the image or the texture of the fabrics.\n\nWhile a serif font could potentially echo the texture of the fabric weave, it might also introduce a level of visual noise or complexity that could detract from the overall simplicity and elegance of the design. A fine sans-serif font, on the other hand, will provide a sense of clarity and precision that will help to balance out the more organic and tactile qualities of the image and the fabrics.\n\nThat being said, if you want to introduce a bit of texture or visual interest to the typography, you could consider using a font with a subtle texture or imperfection that suggests the handmade or crafted quality of the fabrics. For example, a font with a slightly irregular or hand-drawn feel could help to create a sense of connection to the materials and the process of creating them.\n\nHowever, if you do decide to use a sans-serif font, I would recommend keeping it very simple and understated. A font like Helvetica or Akkurat would be a good choice, as they are both clean and neutral without being too flashy or attention-seeking.\n\nIt's also worth considering the size and spacing of the text. Keeping the text small and tightly spaced will help to create a sense of intimacy and quiet contemplation, which could be fitting for a project that explores themes of tenderness and vulnerability."

This will also help to create a sense of calmness and serenity, which will be fitting for a project that explores themes of tenderness and vulnerability.\n\nBy giving the image more air and negative space, you'll also be able to create a sense of tension and anticipation, which will draw the viewer's eye to the image and encourage them to engage with it on a deeper level. And by keeping the text low and subtle, you'll be able to provide context and information without overpowering the image or disrupting the mood.\n\nIt's a very thoughtful and considered approach to layout, and I think it will really help to create a sense of cohesion and harmony in the overall design.
