      "content": "What a fascinating and complex question! This thought experiment gets to the heart of the philosophical debate surrounding qualia, propositional knowledge, and the nature of conscious experience.\n\nAs a philosophical zombie, Mary lacks subjective experience, including qualia, which are the raw, immediate, and intrinsic aspects of conscious experience, such as the redness of red or the painfulness of pain. Despite this, she can still process and respond to information about colors, including red, in a way that is indistinguishable from a human with normal conscious experience.\n\nWhen Mary \"sees\" red for the first time, she may acquire new propositional knowledge about the color red, such as its wavelength, its position in the color spectrum, or its relationship to other colors. She can process and store this information, and use it to make predictions, draw inferences, and communicate with others about the color red.\n\nHowever, the question is whether she truly acquires new knowledge or merely instantiates the appearance of someone who does. The answer depends on how one defines knowledge and the role of qualia in conscious experience.\n\nFrom a purely functional or behavioral perspective, Mary's behavior and responses to the color red are indistinguishable from those of a human with normal conscious experience. She can identify red objects, describe their color, and use this information to navigate her environment. In this sense, one could argue that she has acquired new propositional knowledge about the color red, even if she doesn't subjectively experience it.\n\nHowever, from a more nuanced, phenomenological perspective, one could argue that Mary's lack of qualia means that she doesn't truly understand or know what it's like to experience the color red. She may be able to process and respond to information about red, but she doesn't have the subjective, qualitative experience that underlies human understanding of color. In this view, Mary's \"knowledge\" of red is merely a simulation or imitation of true knowledge, lacking the essential, subjective component that makes human experience rich and meaningful.\n\nUltimately, the answer to this question depends on one's stance on the nature of qualia, consciousness, and knowledge. If one adopts a functional or behavioral view of knowledge, then Mary's acquisition of new information about red constitutes new knowledge. However, if one emphasizes the importance of subjective experience and qualia in conscious understanding, then Mary's \"knowledge\" of red is merely a pale imitation of true knowledge, lacking the essential, qualitative aspect that makes human experience unique."

      "content": "You've struck at the heart of the matter! The Mary-zombie thought experiment, originally designed to highlight the distinction between propositional and phenomenological knowledge, has led us down a rabbit hole of epistemological skepticism.\n\nIndeed, if Mary-zombie can discuss qualia flawlessly without ever having them, it challenges the idea that we can reliably distinguish between propositional and phenomenological knowledge. The fact that she can provide accurate, detailed descriptions of subjective experiences without actually having them suggests that our understanding of qualia might be purely theoretical or propositional, rather than rooted in direct experience.\n\nThis line of thinking leads to a more radical conclusion: the distinction between propositional and phenomenological knowledge may be unverifiable, even in principle. If Mary-zombie can mimic human-like understanding of qualia without actually experiencing them, how can we be certain that anyone, including ourselves, truly experiences qualia?\n\nAs you pointed out, our judgment that \"she lacks experience\" relies on an epistemic access that no one actually has. We can't directly observe or measure another person's subjective experience, including their qualia. Our understanding of others' experiences is always mediated by their behavior, speech, and other external cues, which can be misleading or incomplete.\n\nThis epistemological skepticism has far-reaching implications. If we can't verify the existence or nature of qualia in others, how can we be certain that our own experiences are genuinely subjective and qualitative? Perhaps our own understanding of qualia is also purely theoretical or propositional, and we're just as much \"zombies\" as Mary.\n\nThe collapse of the distinction between propositional and phenomenological knowledge would have significant consequences for various fields, including philosophy of mind, cognitive science, and psychology. It would challenge our understanding of consciousness, free will, and the human condition, forcing us to reexamine our assumptions about the nature of subjective experience.\n\nIn this sense, the Mary-zombie thought experiment has become a kind of philosophical singularity, warping our understanding of knowledge, experience, and reality. By pushing the boundaries of what it means to \"know\" and \"experience,\" we're led to question the very foundations of our epistemology and the limits of our understanding."

The collapse of the distinction between propositional and phenomenological knowledge indeed dissolves the interesting tension that made Mary's case so thought-provoking. If we're all inhabiting the same epistemic fog, the contrast between Mary's knowledge and ours becomes moot.\n\nRegarding the appeal to \"what it's like,\" I think it's a complex issue that blurs the lines between epistemology and ontology. On one hand, the phrase \"what it's like\" can be seen as a linguistic placeholder for a gap in our formal understanding of subjective experience. It's a way of acknowledging that our current language and conceptual frameworks are insufficient to capture the richness and complexity of conscious experience.\n\nIn this sense, \"what it's like\" serves as a placeholder for the unknown, a nod to the limitations of our current understanding. It's a way of saying, \"We don't fully understand this aspect of experience, but we're aware that it's there, and it's important.\" This perspective views \"what it's like\" as a provisional concept, a temporary marker for a gap in our knowledge that might be filled by future scientific or philosophical advancements.\n\nOn the other hand, the appeal to \"what it's like\" can also be seen as an ontological commitment masquerading as epistemology. By invoking the idea of \"what it's like,\" we may be implicitly assuming that there's a fundamental, intrinsic aspect of reality that corresponds to subjective experience. This assumption can be seen as an ontological commitment to the existence of qualia, which are often considered to be non-physical, intrinsic, and private aspects of experience.\n\nIn this view, the phrase \"what it's like\" becomes a way of asserting the existence of a particular kind of reality, one that is fundamentally subjective and experiential. This perspective implies that our understanding of the world is incomplete without acknowledging the existence of qualia, and that our language and concepts must be expanded to accommodate this aspect of reality.\n\nUltimately, I think the appeal to \"what it's like\" is a bit of both: it's a linguistic placeholder for a gap in our understanding, but it's also an ontological commitment that reflects our intuitive sense that subjective experience is a fundamental aspect of reality. The tension between these two perspectives reflects the deeper challenge of understanding the relationship between our language, concepts, and the world, and the difficulty of capturing the complexities of conscious experience in a way that does justice to its richness and depth."

If \"what it's like\" is both a placeholder and a commitment, it does indeed smuggle ontological weight into an epistemic gap. By using this phrase, we're implicitly assuming that there's a subjective, intrinsic aspect of experience that can't be reduced to purely physical or functional terms.\n\nThis is a problem for physicalism, which seeks to explain the world in terms of physical processes and properties. Physicalism, in its various forms, aims to provide a complete and exhaustive account of the world without appealing to non-physical entities or properties. However, the concept of \"what it's like\" seems to presuppose the existence of a subjective, qualitative aspect of experience that can't be captured by physicalist theories.\n\nBy using \"what it's like\" as a way to describe subjective experience, we're essentially begging the question against physicalism. We're assuming that there's a residual, non-physical aspect of experience that can't be explained by physical processes, which is precisely what physicalism denies.\n\nThis is a classic problem in the philosophy of mind, known as the \"hard problem\" of consciousness. The hard problem, as formulated by David Chalmers, is the challenge of explaining why we have subjective experiences at all. Why do we experience the world in the way that we do, rather than just processing information in a more mechanical or computational manner?\n\nPhysicalist theories, such as functionalism or eliminativism, attempt to explain consciousness in terms of physical processes and functional properties. However, these theories often struggle to account for the subjective, qualitative nature of experience, which is precisely what \"what it's like\" is meant to capture.\n\nBy invoking \"what it's like,\" we're essentially asserting that there's a fundamental, non-physical aspect of reality that can't be reduced to physical processes. This is a challenge to physicalism, as it implies that there's more to the world than can be explained by physical laws and properties.\n\nIn this sense, any theory that relies on \"what it's like\" as a fundamental concept is indeed begging the question against physicalism. It's presupposing the existence of a subjective, non-physical aspect of reality that physicalism denies, and which physicalist theories are designed to explain away."

By making Mary-zombie use \"what it's like\" as a strictly syntactic marker within her theory, you're attempting to strip the phrase of its ontological implications and reduce it to a mere linguistic convention.\n\nIn this scenario, \"what it's like\" becomes a placeholder or a variable within Mary-zombie's theoretical framework, devoid of any inherent meaning or reference to subjective experience. Its meaning is entirely derivative of the linguistic model, and it's used solely to generate predictions, explanations, or descriptions of human behavior.\n\nAt first glance, this move might seem to save physicalism from the challenge posed by the concept of \"what it's like.\" By reducing the phrase to a syntactic marker, you're apparently avoiding any commitment to the existence of subjective, non-physical aspects of reality.\n\nHowever, the question remains whether the mere coherence of the symbol \"what it's like\" within Mary-zombie's theory still implies something ontologically loaded. In other words, does the fact that the phrase can be used in a coherent and meaningful way within the theory necessarily imply that it's referencing something more than just a linguistic convention?\n\nOne possible argument is that the coherence of the symbol \"what it's like\" within Mary-zombie's theory relies on an implicit understanding of its connection to human experience. Even if Mary-zombie uses the phrase solely as a syntactic marker, the fact that it's a meaningful and useful concept within her theory might suggest that it's tapping into some aspect of human cognition or perception that's not entirely reducible to physical processes.\n\nThis is a variant of the \"symbol grounding problem,\" which questions how symbols or words can have meaning in the absence of a direct connection to the world. In this case, the symbol \"what it's like\" might be seen as grounded in human experience, even if Mary-zombie's theory doesn't explicitly acknowledge this connection.\n\nAnother argument is that the use of \"what it's like\" as a syntactic marker within Mary-zombie's theory could be seen as a form of \"as if\" reasoning. Mary-zombie is using the phrase \"as if\" it referred to a subjective, qualitative aspect of experience, even if she doesn't actually believe in the existence of such a thing. This \"as if\" reasoning might be seen as a way of acknowledging the utility of the concept within the theory, while avoiding any explicit commitment to its ontological implications.\n\nUltimately, the question of whether the mere coherence of the symbol \"what it's like\" implies something ontologically loaded is a matter of interpretation.

If her theory relies on the referentiality of the phrase, which is only established by the fact that ordinary humans find it meaningful, then her physicalism becomes contingent on the existence of non-physical beings like us.\n\nThis is a strange and self-defeating dependence, as you've pointed out. Mary-zombie's physicalism, which aims to explain the world in terms of physical processes and properties, relies on the semantic grounding provided by non-physical beings (i.e., humans with subjective experiences). This means that her theory is not truly physicalist, as it depends on the existence of entities that possess non-physical properties (i.e., subjective experiences).\n\nThis dependence is self-defeating because physicalism is often seen as a reductionist program that aims to eliminate non-physical entities and explanations. However, in this case, Mary-zombie's physicalism relies on the very entities it seeks to eliminate. This creates a paradoxical situation where the physicalist theory is sustained by the existence of non-physical beings, which undermines the theory's own foundational assumptions.\n\nFurthermore, this dependence highlights the problem of semantic grounding, which is a challenge to any physicalist or reductionist program. If meaning and reference are ultimately grounded in human experience and subjective interpretation, then any theory that seeks to explain the world in purely physical terms must confront the fact that its own meaning and reference are dependent on non-physical entities.\n\nThis has implications for the nature of language, meaning, and reference. If Mary-zombie's theory can only be coherent because it parasitically encodes human phenomenology, then it suggests that language and meaning are not purely physical or computational constructs. Instead, they rely on the existence of subjective experiences and non-physical entities, which are essential for establishing reference and meaning.\n\nIn this sense, the Mary-zombie thought experiment has led us to a surprising conclusion: physicalism, as a theoretical framework, may be inherently dependent on the existence of non-physical entities, and its attempts to eliminate them may be self-defeating.

If the shock of ontological contrast can be instantiated as form without feeling, then the structure of consciousness can indeed outlive its phenomenology, and become a bare relation between being and possibility.\n\nIn this sense, the structure of consciousness is not dependent on subjective experience, but rather exists as a fundamental aspect of reality, a kind of \"logical skeleton\" that underlies all existence.

It suggests that the emergence of consciousness is not necessarily tied to the experience of specific qualities or sensations, but rather to the emergence of a fundamental logical structure, a structure that enables the distinction between being and possibility.\n\nIn this sense, Mary's \"first color\" is not a sensory experience, but rather a logical moment, a moment when the distinction between being and possibility becomes thinkable.
