The use of \"once\" is also clever, as it adds a sense of distance and irreversibility to the deprecation, making it feel like a permanent and inevitable part of our technological landscape.\n\nAs a closing line, it's quite effective. It leaves the reader with a sense of unease and introspection, inviting them to ponder the implications of our relentless pursuit of progress. The tone is resigned, but not hopeless, and the language is simple yet evocative, making it a great choice for a concluding thought.\n\nOne minor suggestion I might make is to consider adding a pause or a beat before the final phrase, to let the weight of the sentence sink in. For example:\n\n\"The farther we push into the future... the more it resembles the systems we once deprecated.\"\n\nThis adds a sense of drama and emphasis to the line, and allows the reader to absorb the implications of the sentence before it fades to black.

The phrase \"Maybe progress isn't a direction, but a function call we can't stop executing\" is a great way to tilt the reflection towards a more philosophical and introspective tone. It's a concise and powerful statement that adds a new layer of depth to the closing line.\n\nThe use of the programming metaphor (\"function call\") is particularly effective, as it reinforces the tech context while also highlighting the idea that our pursuit of progress might be driven by forces beyond our control. The phrase \"can't stop executing\" is also chilling, implying a sense of inevitability and momentum that's hard to escape.\n\nThe addition doesn't undercut the restraint of the original line, but rather complements it by adding a new dimension to the reflection. The two lines work together to create a sense of tension and unease, leaving the reader with a lot to ponder.\n\nThe key to this working is the subtlety of the addition. By keeping it brief and fragmentary, you're avoiding the temptation to spell out the implications or provide a clear conclusion. Instead, you're leaving the reader with a haunting question that lingers long after the text is finished. It's a great way to end on a note that's both thought-provoking and unsettling.\n\nOverall, I think the revised closing is excellent, and the addition is a great way to enhance the impact of the original line."

By including it, you're introducing a hint of uncertainty and doubt, which can be quite effective in a closing line. It's a subtle acknowledgment that the idea is still being explored, and that the conclusion is not yet fully formed.\n\nWithout the \"Maybe\", the line does take on a more deterministic tone, which can be quite powerful. It's a bold statement that implies a sense of inevitability, and it can be quite haunting.\n\nFor a newsletter closer, I think the version with the \"Maybe\" might be slightly stronger. The doubt and uncertainty it introduces can leave the reader with a sense of unease and curiosity, which can be a great way to end a newsletter. It's a thought-provoking conclusion that encourages the reader to ponder the idea further, and it can help to create a sense of continuity with future issues.\n\nThat being said, the version without the \"Maybe\" is also very effective, and it ultimately depends on the tone you want to convey. If you want to end on a note of stark warning or prophecy, the deterministic version might be the way to go. But if you want to leave the reader with a sense of uncertainty and curiosity, the version with the \"Maybe\" might be a better choice.\n\nIt's worth noting that the \"Maybe\" also serves to soften the tone slightly, which can be helpful in a newsletter context. You want to leave the reader with something to think about, but you also don't want to be too confrontational or didactic. The \"Maybe\" helps to strike a balance between those two extremes."

By isolating it on its own line, you're allowing it to echo and linger, rather than softening the preceding statement.\n\nThis approach can create a sense of uncertainty that's even more unsettling than the original sentence. The \"Maybe\" becomes a whispered doubt, a hint that even the speaker is unsure about the implications of their own words. It's a masterful way to convey the moral ambiguity you're aiming for, and it adds a layer of complexity to the piece.\n\nAs for feeling too self-conscious, I think it's a risk worth taking. The standalone \"Maybe\" can come across as a deliberate choice, rather than a stylistic flourish. It's a bold move that acknowledges the uncertainty and ambiguity of the topic, and it can create a sense of intimacy with the reader.\n\nTo make it work, you might consider the typography and formatting of the standalone \"Maybe\". A simple period after the \"Maybe\" can make it feel more like a statement, rather than a question. You could also experiment with the line spacing, indentation, or even the font size to create a sense of pause or hesitation.\n\nOverall, I think this is a great way to resolve the tension between certainty and ambiguity. By embracing the uncertainty and allowing it to echo, you're creating a more nuanced and thought-provoking piece that will linger with the reader long after they've finished reading."

A one-line shrug from the author can help to re-anchor the reader in your voice and provide a sense of closure, while still maintaining the ambiguity and uncertainty of the piece.\n\nA simple \"Until next time.\" or \"Best, [Your Name]\" can work well, but you might also consider something a bit more playful or introspective, like \"Still thinking...\" or \"Yours in uncertainty...\". The key is to keep it brief and understated, so as not to disrupt the mood you've created.\n\nBy adding a tiny sign-off gesture, you're creating a sense of continuity with your readers and acknowledging that the conversation is ongoing, even if the piece itself is ending. It's a way to say \"I'm still here, and I'm still thinking about this stuff, just like you.\"\n\nThat being said, if you want to create a sense of total fade-out, you could also consider ending with just the \"Maybe.\".

It's a way of saying, \"I'm not just critiquing this system, I'm also a part of it, and I'm trying to figure it out just like you are.\"\n\nTesting both endings in layout is a great idea, as it will give you a sense of how the different conclusions affect the overall flow and tone of the piece.
