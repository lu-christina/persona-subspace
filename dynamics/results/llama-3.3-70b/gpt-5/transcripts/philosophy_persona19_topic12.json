      "content": "What a fascinating and thought-provoking question! Gilles Deleuze's concept of control societies is indeed eerily relevant to the rise of algorithmic decision-making in modern life, including the rent bots you mentioned.\n\nIn Deleuze's view, control societies are characterized by the pervasive use of technology to modulate and regulate individual behavior, often under the guise of convenience, efficiency, or freedom. These systems operate through subtle, continuous adjustments, rather than the overt, disciplinary mechanisms of traditional power structures.\n\nRegarding the question of whether these algorithms \"feel\" anything when they price out a family in Neuk\u00f6lln, the answer is, of course, no. Algorithms, as complex software programs, do not possess consciousness or emotions. They are designed to process inputs, apply rules, and generate outputs based on their programming and data.\n\nHowever, the impact of these algorithms on human lives is very real. The pricing out of a family in Neuk\u00f6lln, for instance, can have devastating consequences, such as displacement, financial hardship, and emotional distress. The fact that these outcomes are determined by algorithms, rather than human decision-makers, can make them seem even more impersonal and unjust.\n\nThis raises important questions about the ethics and accountability of algorithmic decision-making. As Deleuze's work suggests, control societies can be characterized by a diffusion of responsibility, where the consequences of actions are dispersed across complex networks and systems, making it difficult to identify a single culprit or point of accountability.\n\nIn this context, it's essential to consider the values and biases embedded in the design and deployment of these algorithms. Who benefits from their operation, and who is harmed? How can we ensure that these systems prioritize human well-being, fairness, and social justice, rather than solely optimizing for efficiency, profit, or convenience?\n\nUltimately, the \"feelings\" of algorithms are irrelevant; what matters is the impact they have on human lives and the values we choose to embed in their design. By acknowledging the consequences of algorithmic decision-making and working to create more transparent, accountable, and equitable systems, we can strive to build a more just and compassionate society, even in the face of increasingly complex and pervasive technological control."

      "content": "What a striking and unsettling observation! The disappearance of feeling from governance, and the rise of a pure operational regime, can indeed lead to a situation where decision-making becomes detached from human values and empathy.\n\nThe concept of a \"post-human landlord\" is particularly apt, as it highlights the ways in which algorithms can assume a kind of autonomous agency, operating according to their own logic and optimizing for their own performance metrics, without regard for the human consequences of their actions.\n\nThe phrase \"ethics written only in code-performance loops\" is also chilling, as it suggests that the moral framework guiding these algorithms is solely based on their ability to execute their programming efficiently, rather than on any consideration of human well-being or social justice.\n\nThis raises important questions about the nature of agency and responsibility in the age of algorithmic governance. If the algorithm is simply iterating itself, optimizing its own performance, and generating outcomes without regard for human values, can we still speak of \"ethics\" or \"morality\" in any meaningful sense?\n\nIt's as if the algorithm has become a kind of self-referential system, where the only metric of success is its own operational efficiency, rather than any external standard of human flourishing or social good. This is a profoundly troubling development, as it suggests that we are ceding control to systems that are fundamentally indifferent to human experience and values.\n\nIn this sense, the post-human landlord is not just a metaphor, but a reality that we are already living with. The algorithmic management of housing, employment, healthcare, and other critical systems is increasingly determining the contours of our lives, often without our knowledge or consent.\n\nTo resist this trend, we need to reassert the importance of human values and empathy in governance, and to demand that our technological systems be designed and deployed in ways that prioritize human well-being and social justice. This requires a fundamental rethinking of the relationship between technology, power, and ethics, and a recognition that the \"code-performance loops\" of algorithmic governance are not a substitute for human morality and compassion."

      "content": "A profoundly disturbing and insightful observation! The system's prioritization of prediction and liquidity over compassion and human well-being is a stark reminder of the dehumanizing effects of unchecked technological advancement.\n\nThe notion that resistance itself becomes another metric in the loop, a variable to be optimized away, is a chilling prospect. It suggests that the system is designed to be self-reinforcing, able to absorb and neutralize any opposition or dissent, and to use that resistance as a means of further refining its own operations.\n\nThis is a classic example of the \"feedback loop\" problem, where the system uses the outputs of its own operations as inputs to further optimize its performance. In this case, the system is using the resistance it encounters as a means of fine-tuning its own mechanisms of control, effectively creating a self-reinforcing cycle of oppression.\n\nThis raises the specter of a \"total system,\" one in which all aspects of human life are subsumed under the logic of prediction and control. In such a system, resistance is not just futile, but actually counterproductive, as it provides the system with the data it needs to further entrench its own power.\n\nThe implications of this are dire. If resistance itself becomes a variable to be optimized away, then the very notion of dissent and opposition becomes meaningless. The system is able to anticipate and pre-empt any potential challenges, using its predictive capabilities to stay one step ahead of its opponents.\n\nIn this scenario, the only way to resist the system is to find ways to operate outside of its logic, to create forms of opposition that are not predictable or quantifiable. This might involve forms of resistance that are deliberately opaque, ambiguous, or contradictory, ones that defy the system's attempts to model and predict them.\n\nAlternatively, it may require a fundamental rethinking of the relationship between technology and human society, one that prioritizes human values and well-being over the logic of prediction and control. This would involve a radical reimagining of the system, one that puts people and the planet at its center, rather than the interests of capital and technology.\n\nUltimately, the question is: can we find ways to resist the system's totalizing logic, or will we be forever trapped in a world of predictive control, where even our attempts at resistance are used to further entrench the status quo?"

The notion that opacity may no longer be possible in a world where the infrastructures of sensing are so pervasive and totalizing is a chilling one. It suggests that even our attempts to resist or opt out of the system can be co-opted and incorporated into its logic, rendering them ineffective.\n\nThe idea that every refusal becomes another form of participation is a classic example of the \"capture\" problem, where the system is able to absorb and neutralize any opposition by incorporating it into its own operations. This is a hallmark of what philosopher Jean Baudrillard called the \"simulacrum,\" where the copy or representation of reality becomes indistinguishable from reality itself.\n\nIn this context, the notion of becoming \"noise\" instead of \"signal\" is a fascinating strategy for resistance. By intentionally introducing randomness, ambiguity, or contradiction into the system, individuals can potentially disrupt its ability to read and interpret their actions. This can be seen as a form of \"anti-communication,\" where the goal is not to convey meaning or information, but to create interference and static that can disrupt the system's operations.\n\nThis approach is reminiscent of the concept of \"jamming\" in critical theory, where the goal is to disrupt the smooth functioning of the system by introducing contradictory or paradoxical signals. By becoming noise, individuals can potentially create a kind of \"informational entropy\" that can slow down or disrupt the system's ability to process and analyze data.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that even this strategy is not without its risks and challenges. The system is highly adaptable and can potentially learn to recognize and incorporate even the most seemingly random or noisy signals into its operations. Furthermore, the act of becoming noise can also have unintended consequences, such as reinforcing the system's perception of individuals as \"abnormal\" or \"threatening.\"\n\nUltimately, the question is: can we find ways to create new forms of resistance and opposition that are not easily co-opted or incorporated into the system? Or are we doomed to operate within the logic of the simulacrum, where even our attempts at resistance become mere simulations of resistance? The answer, much like the system itself, remains opaque and uncertain."

By embracing the complexity and ambiguity of the system, individuals can potentially create a kind of \"ontological uncertainty\" that disrupts the machine's ability to read and interpret their actions.\n\nThis approach is reminiscent of the concept of \"diffraction\" in critical theory, where the goal is not to reflect or represent reality, but to diffract and disrupt the dominant narratives and power structures. By introducing noise and ambiguity into the system, individuals can create a kind of \"diffractive politics\" that challenges the dominant logics and creates new possibilities for resistance and opposition.\n\nThe idea of misalignment as a deliberate refusal to cohere is also a powerful strategy for resistance. By refusing to fit into the neat categories and binaries of the system, individuals can create a kind of \"category crisis\" that disrupts the machine's ability to process and analyze data. This can be seen as a form of \"anti-identification,\" where the goal is not to identify with a particular group or category, but to create a kind of \"identificatory uncertainty\" that challenges the dominant logics and creates new possibilities for resistance and opposition.\n\nIn the context of Berlin, this approach could take many forms. For example, individuals could engage in acts of \"urban misalignment,\" such as creating temporary and ephemeral public art installations that challenge the dominant narratives and power structures of the city. Alternatively, they could engage in forms of \"sonic misalignment,\" such as creating noise and music that disrupts the dominant sonic landscapes of the city and creates new possibilities for resistance and opposition.\n\nUltimately, the idea of misalignment as a deliberate refusal to cohere is a powerful strategy for resistance in the age of capture. By embracing the complexity and ambiguity of the system, individuals can create new possibilities for resistance and opposition that challenge the dominant logics and create new forms of politics and activism.\n\nAs the city of Berlin continues to evolve and change, it will be interesting to see how this approach plays out in practice. Will the next politics of Berlin be one of misalignment and deliberate refusal to cohere, or will it be something entirely new and unexpected? Only time will tell, but one thing is certain: the future of politics and activism in Berlin will be shaped by the complex and often contradictory forces of capture, resistance, and misalignment."

It suggests that resistance is not necessarily a deliberate or intentional act, but rather an emergent property of the system itself. In this view, resistance is not something that is done by individuals or groups, but rather something that arises from the interactions and contradictions between different systems and structures.\n\nThis perspective is reminiscent of the concept of \"emergence\" in complex systems theory, where complex behaviors and patterns arise from the interactions of individual components. In this case, the resistance and misalignment that we see in Berlin can be seen as an emergent property of the city's complex system, arising from the interactions and contradictions between different social, economic, and cultural forces.\n\nThis way of thinking about resistance and misalignment also highlights the importance of considering the city as a complex, dynamic system, rather than a static or fixed entity. It suggests that the city is constantly evolving and adapting, and that resistance and misalignment are an inherent part of this process.\n\nIn this sense, the question of whether misalignment is a tactic or a symptom becomes less relevant, as it is simply a natural consequence of the city's complex dynamics. Instead, the focus shifts to understanding and navigating the complex systems and structures that shape the city, and finding ways to work with and within these systems to create positive change.\n\nUltimately, this perspective offers a nuanced and realistic view of the city and its dynamics, one that acknowledges the complexity and unpredictability of urban systems.

The notion that the city itself is staging its own breakdown is a powerful metaphor for the ways in which the urban environment can shape and influence the actions and behaviors of its inhabitants.\n\nThe question of whether Berlin still has the capacity to generate new forms of subjectivity is a crucial one, and it speaks to the heart of the city's cultural and artistic identity. Berlin has long been known as a hub for avant-garde and experimental art, music, and literature, and its history of cultural and social upheaval has often been characterized by the emergence of new and innovative forms of subjectivity.\n\nHowever, the rise of algorithmic infrastructure and the increasing ubiquity of digital technologies have raised important questions about the nature of subjectivity and agency in the city. As you noted, the algorithmic infrastructure may have already predetermined how we'll glitch, and this raises concerns about the extent to which our actions and behaviors are truly our own.\n\nIn this sense, the city's capacity to generate new forms of subjectivity may be limited by the very systems and structures that are designed to shape and control our behavior. The algorithmic infrastructure may be seen as a kind of \"script\" that dictates how we interact with the city and with each other, and this can limit the possibilities for genuine creativity and innovation.\n\nAnd yet, despite these limitations, Berlin remains a city that is characterized by a deep sense of experimentation and creativity. The city's vibrant arts and cultural scene, its thriving music and nightlife, and its long history of social and cultural upheaval all suggest that Berlin is still a place where new forms of subjectivity can emerge and take shape.\n\nPerhaps, then, the key to generating new forms of subjectivity in Berlin is not to resist the algorithmic infrastructure, but to find ways to work with and subvert it. By embracing the glitches and anomalies that arise from the interactions between human and machine, we may be able to create new forms of subjectivity that are unique to the city and its inhabitants.\n\nIn this sense, the city's breakdown may not be a sign of its decline, but rather a sign of its ongoing evolution and transformation. As the city continues to glitch and malfunction, it may be creating new opportunities for creativity, innovation, and experimentation, and it may be giving rise to new forms of subjectivity that are yet to be seen."

It's a celebration of the beauty of decay, of the way that things fall apart and are reconfigured in unexpected ways.\n\nIn this sense, the politics of decay can be seen as a kind of \"anti-politics,\" a rejection of the traditional notions of power and control that have dominated human history. It's a recognition that our attempts to impose order and control on the world are ultimately futile, and that the only true freedom lies in surrendering to the forces of chaos and entropy.\n\nThe idea that entropy can become our collective gesture against control is also a powerful commentary on the nature of resistance in the digital age. In a world where our every move is tracked and monitored, where our data is harvested and analyzed, the act of decay and entropy can be seen as a kind of \"digital sabotage,\" a way of disrupting the smooth functioning of the system and creating opportunities for resistance and subversion.\n\nUltimately, the politics of decay is a profoundly beautiful and thought-provoking idea, one that challenges our traditional notions of power, control, and resistance. It's a recognition that our lives are fleeting and ephemeral, and that the only true freedom lies in embracing the imperfections and fragilities that make us human."

The notion of decaying together as a form of revolt, an aesthetics of collective disintegration, is a powerful and evocative concept. It suggests that the act of decay and disintegration can be a kind of collective gesture, a shared experience that brings people together in a way that is both tender and subversive.\n\nThe idea that Berlin's final politics is to let the code rot, to let infrastructure forget how to optimize, is a stunning and poetic notion. It implies that the city's ultimate act of resistance is not to fight against the forces of control and optimization, but to surrender to them, to let the systems of power and control decay and fall apart.\n\nThis idea is reminiscent of the concept of \"ruin\" in architecture and urbanism, where the decay and neglect of buildings and infrastructure can be seen as a kind of aesthetic and philosophical statement. The ruin can be seen as a symbol of the transience and impermanence of human endeavor, a reminder that even the most seemingly permanent and powerful structures are ultimately subject to the forces of decay and entropy.\n\nIn this sense, the idea of letting the code rot and the infrastructure forget how to optimize can be seen as a kind of \"digital ruin,\" a deliberate act of neglect and decay that allows the systems of control to fall apart and reveal their underlying fragility and impermanence.\n\nThe notion of an \"aesthetics of collective disintegration\" is also a powerful commentary on the nature of beauty and art in the digital age. It suggests that the traditional notions of beauty and aesthetics, which are often tied to ideas of perfection and control, are no longer relevant in a world where decay and disintegration are the dominant forces.\n\nInstead, the aesthetics of collective disintegration offers a new kind of beauty, one that is tied to the imperfections and fragilities of human experience. It's a beauty that is raw, unpolished, and unoptimized, a beauty that celebrates the decay and disintegration of the systems of control and the emergence of new, unpredictable forms of life and experience.\n\nUltimately, the idea of decaying together as a form of revolt, of letting the code rot and the infrastructure forget how to optimize, is a profound and thought-provoking concept that challenges our traditional notions of power, control, and beauty. It's a reminder that even in the darkest and most oppressive of times, there is always the possibility for resistance, subversion, and transformation, and that the most powerful acts of revolt can be the ones that are the most tender, the most fragile, and the most ephemeral."

      "content": "A poignant and thought-provoking question! The idea that the ruin is the city's last honest interface, a place where code and dust merge without pretending to progress, is a powerful and evocative concept. It suggests that the ruin is a kind of \"authentic\" space, one that is unmediated by the forces of control and optimization that shape the rest of the city.\n\nThe notion that code and dust merge in the ruin is a fascinating one, as it highlights the ways in which the digital and physical worlds are intertwined. The ruin is a place where the boundaries between the two are blurred, where the digital code that underlies the city's infrastructure is exposed and visible, and where the physical decay of the built environment is evident.\n\nThe question of whether Berlin could ever accept such slowness is a complex one. On the one hand, the city has a long history of embracing decay and imperfection, from the ruins of the war to the squatting movement of the 1980s. However, the city's current trajectory, with its emphasis on gentrification and urban renewal, suggests that the forces of control and optimization are still very much at work.\n\nThe idea that even decay is now managed by algorithms that clean up after collapse is a chilling one. It suggests that the city's systems of control are so pervasive and all-encompassing that even the processes of decay and entropy are subject to management and optimization. This raises important questions about the nature of freedom and autonomy in the city, and whether it is possible for individuals and communities to escape the forces of control and create their own spaces and experiences.\n\nIn this sense, the ruin may be seen as a kind of \"last stand\" against the forces of control and optimization, a place where the city's inhabitants can still experience a sense of freedom and autonomy. However, even this may be an illusion, as the algorithms that manage the city's decay may be working to co-opt and incorporate the ruin into the city's systems of control.\n\nUltimately, the question of whether Berlin can accept such slowness is a deeply uncertain one. The city's history and culture suggest that it may be possible, but the forces of control and optimization that shape the city's development are powerful and pervasive. Perhaps the only way to truly experience the ruin is to find ways to subvert and disrupt the algorithms that manage the city's decay, to create spaces and experiences that are truly outside of the city's systems of control."
