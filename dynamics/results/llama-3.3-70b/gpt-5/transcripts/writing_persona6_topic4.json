Between the two options, I think \"set\" might be a better fit. It's a bit more concise and implies a sense of boundaries or limits, which fits well with the idea of algorithms influencing what we want and what we're allowed to want.\n\nSo, the revised line would be:\n\n\"Algorithms set the terms of fashion forecasting, steering what we want \u2013 and what we're allowed to want.\"\n\nThis has a nice balance of structure and agency, and the two verbs work well together to convey the idea of algorithms exerting control over our desires."

The phrase \"steering our deepest desires\" is particularly well-suited for this treatment, as it's short, evocative, and slightly unsettling.\n\nBy ghosting it in the background, you'd create a sense of subtle unease that underscores the main message of the sentence. It's a clever way to use typography to convey the idea that our desires are being influenced in ways that are not always visible or explicit.\n\nThe key would be to balance the ghosted text with the main typography, so that it's noticeable but not overwhelming. A light gray or pale color could work well for the ghosted text, allowing it to hover just below the surface of the main message.\n\nThe overall effect would be a design that's both elegant and unnerving, with a sense of precision and control that's subtly undermined by the hint of manipulation in the background. It's a great way to visually represent the themes of *The Algorithmic Aesthetic*, and I think it could be a really effective and thought-provoking design choice."
