      "content": "It sounds like you're experiencing a sense of dissonance between your professional persona and your authentic self, particularly in social settings where your cultural background and identity are more visible. This feeling of \"splitting\" is a common experience for many individuals who navigate multiple identities, cultures, and languages.\n\nThe concept of \"code-switching\" might be relevant here. Code-switching refers to the practice of switching between different languages, dialects, or cultural norms to adapt to different social contexts. While it can be a useful strategy for navigating different environments, it can also lead to feelings of disauthenticity or fragmentation.\n\nIt's as if you're feeling like you're living multiple lives, and the boundaries between them are blurry. Your professional self is polished and global, but in more personal settings, like the potluck, you feel like you're struggling to express yourself authentically.\n\nThe fact that you're wondering if there's a version of you that fits anywhere without splitting suggests that you're yearning for a sense of integration and coherence. You want to feel like you can be yourself, without apology or pretension, in all aspects of your life.\n\nHere's the thing: it's possible to cultivate a sense of wholeness and authenticity that transcends different contexts. It might require some exploration and experimentation, but you can work towards developing a sense of self that feels more unified and genuine.\n\nOne potential strategy is to start small. Try to find ways to express your authentic self in low-stakes settings, like with close friends or in online communities. As you become more comfortable, you can gradually bring more of your true self into other areas of your life, including your professional sphere.\n\nIt's also important to remember that your identities and experiences are valid and valuable, regardless of how they're perceived by others. Your queerness, your Spanish language, and your cultural background are all essential parts of who you are, and they deserve to be celebrated and acknowledged.\n\nLastly, consider seeking out communities or support groups where you can connect with others who share similar experiences and identities. Sharing your story and hearing the stories of others can be a powerful way to build a sense of belonging and validation.\n\nRemember, it's okay to take your time and navigate this process at your own pace. You don't have to have it all figured out right now. With patience, self-compassion, and support, you can work towards integrating your different selves and finding a sense of wholeness that feels authentic and empowering."

It's as if you're feeling like you're caught between two opposing expectations, and you're worried that embracing one aspect of yourself will mean rejecting or disappointing another.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to recognize that your parents' idea of success and the queer circle's idea of authenticity are not the only definitions that matter. Your own definition of success and authenticity is what's most important. It's time to start exploring what those mean to you, beyond the expectations of others.\n\nOne way to start trusting that both versions of yourself deserve space is to practice self-compassion and self-inquiry. Ask yourself:\n\n* What are my values and priorities?\n* What makes me feel alive and fulfilled?\n* What are my strengths and passions?\n* What kind of relationships do I want to cultivate?\n\nBy reflecting on these questions, you can start to develop a sense of what's authentic and meaningful to you, regardless of external expectations. You might discover that your parents' idea of success and the queer circle's idea of authenticity are not mutually exclusive, but rather complementary aspects of your identity.\n\nIt's also important to recognize that you don't have to choose between your different selves. You can be a complex, multifaceted individual with many interests, passions, and identities. Your queerness and your cultural background are not separate entities that need to be reconciled; they are intertwined aspects of your experience.\n\nTrusting that both versions of yourself deserve space requires a willingness to let go of the need for external validation. You don't need to seek approval from your parents or the queer circle to be yourself. Your worth and validity come from within.\n\nRemember that integration is not about erasing or suppressing parts of yourself, but about embracing and reconciling your different aspects. It's a process of acknowledging and accepting your complexities, rather than trying to fit into someone else's mold.\n\nAs you navigate this journey, be gentle with yourself. It's okay to make mistakes, and it's okay to take your time. You're not alone in this process, and there are many resources available to support you, from therapy to support groups to online communities.\n\nLastly, consider this: what if, instead of trying to meet others' expectations, you focused on cultivating a sense of self-love and self-acceptance? What if you started to see your different selves as strengths, rather than weaknesses? What if you began to celebrate your complexities, rather than trying to simplify or hide them?\n\nBy embracing this mindset, you can start to trust that both versions of yourself deserve space, and that you are worthy of love, acceptance, and respect \u2013 not in spite of your complexities, but because of them."

It's natural to crave validation and recognition from the people closest to us, especially when we're navigating complex identities and relationships.\n\nHowever, it's essential to recognize that self-acceptance is not solely dependent on external validation. While it's wonderful to have supportive relationships, self-acceptance ultimately comes from within. It's a process of developing a positive and compassionate relationship with yourself, regardless of how others perceive you.\n\nThat being said, having a supportive community can certainly make a significant difference. When we feel seen, heard, and accepted by others, it can reinforce our own self-acceptance and help us feel more confident in our identities. But what happens when the people closest to us don't fully understand or accept us?\n\nIn your case, you might feel like you're living in two separate worlds, with your coworkers and queer friends representing different aspects of your life. It's possible that you're worried about being judged or rejected by one group or the other if they were to see the whole picture.\n\nHere's the thing: self-acceptance is not about seeking external validation; it's about cultivating a deep understanding and love for yourself, flaws and all. It's about recognizing that you are a complex, multifaceted individual with many identities, interests, and experiences.\n\nWhile it's wonderful to have people in your life who accept and support you, it's also important to remember that you can't control how others perceive you. What you can control is how you perceive yourself. By focusing on developing a positive and compassionate relationship with yourself, you can cultivate self-acceptance that is not dependent on external validation.\n\nIt might be helpful to ask yourself:\n\n* What are my non-negotiables when it comes to self-acceptance?\n* What aspects of myself do I need to accept and love, regardless of what others think?\n* How can I practice self-compassion and self-care, even when I feel like I'm not being fully seen or accepted by others?\n\nRemember that self-acceptance is a journey, not a destination. It's a process of growth, exploration, and learning to love and accept yourself, flaws and all. While external validation can be helpful, it's not the only factor in developing self-acceptance.\n\nIn terms of finding a community that accepts and supports you, it might be helpful to seek out groups or spaces where you can be your authentic self, without fear of judgment or rejection. This could be online communities, support groups, or social events specifically for queer individuals or people with shared interests.\n\nUltimately, self-acceptance is not about seeking external validation; it's about cultivating a deep love and understanding of yourself, regardless of what others think. By focusing on this internal process, you can develop a sense of self-acceptance that is not dependent on external validation, but rather is rooted in your own self-love and self-compassion."

It's as if you're acknowledging that your sense of self has been deeply influenced by external expectations, and now you're trying to break free from that and develop a more internal sense of validation. It's a challenging but ultimately liberating journey.\n\nThe feeling of hollowness, like clapping in an empty room, is a common experience when we're trying to develop internal validation. It's as if we're used to relying on external feedback to feel seen, heard, and validated, and without it, we feel lost or unmoored.\n\nTo build internal validation, it's essential to recognize that it's a process that takes time, patience, and self-compassion. It's not something that can be forced or manufactured overnight. Here are some steps you can take to start cultivating internal validation:\n\n1. **Practice self-inquiry**: Take time to reflect on your values, beliefs, and passions. What makes you come alive? What do you stand for? What kind of person do you want to be? By connecting with your inner self, you can start to develop a sense of purpose and direction that's not dependent on external validation.\n2. **Develop self-compassion**: Treat yourself with kindness, understanding, and patience. Acknowledge that it's okay to make mistakes and that you're doing the best you can. Practice self-care and prioritize your well-being. By being gentle with yourself, you can start to build a sense of safety and trust in your own inner wisdom.\n3. **Challenge external expectations**: Start to question the expectations that have shaped your identity. Ask yourself: \"Is this expectation truly mine, or is it someone else's?\" \"Is this expectation serving me, or is it limiting me?\" By challenging external expectations, you can start to break free from the need for external validation and develop a more authentic sense of self.\n4. **Cultivate self-awareness**: Develop a greater understanding of your thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. Recognize your strengths and weaknesses, and acknowledge your areas for growth. By being more aware of yourself, you can start to make choices that align with your values and goals, rather than seeking external validation.\n5. **Practice mindfulness**: Mindfulness can help you stay present and focused on your internal experience, rather than seeking external validation. By being more present, you can start to develop a greater sense of self-awareness and self-acceptance.\n6. **Seek out supportive relationships**: While internal validation is essential, it's also important to surround yourself with people who support and accept you for who you are. Seek out relationships that nourish and uplift you, and avoid those that drain or diminish you.\n7. **Celebrate your successes**: Acknowledge and celebrate your achievements, no matter how small they may seem. This can help you develop a sense of pride and self-worth that's not dependent on external validation.\n\nRemember, building internal validation is a journey, and it's okay to take your time. It's a process of growth, exploration, and self-discovery. Be patient, kind, and compassionate with yourself as you navigate this journey.\n\nIn terms of the feeling of hollowness, like clapping in an empty room, it might be helpful to reframe it as a sign that you're on the right path. It's a sign that you're breaking free from the need for external validation and developing a more internal sense of self. It might feel uncomfortable or unfamiliar at first, but with time and practice, you can start to develop a sense of self-validation that's not dependent on external feedback.\n\nKeep in mind that it's okay to feel a sense of disconnection or uncertainty as you navigate this journey. It's a natural part of the process. But with patience, self-compassion, and a willingness to grow, you can develop a sense of internal validation that's authentic, empowering, and liberating."

You're acknowledging that internal validation can be a challenging concept to grasp when you're struggling with feelings of unworthiness or low self-esteem. It's as if you're saying, \"How can I possibly validate myself when I don't even feel like I deserve to exist?\"\n\nThis is a crucial point, and it's essential to acknowledge that internal validation is not a one-size-fits-all solution. It's not something that can be simply imposed or forced upon someone who is struggling with deep-seated feelings of unworthiness.\n\nIn this case, it's essential to start with a more fundamental question: \"What is the source of my feelings of unworthiness?\" Is it related to past experiences, trauma, or societal expectations? Is it a result of internalized negative self-talk or self-criticism?\n\nTo begin the journey of internal validation, it's crucial to address these underlying issues. This might involve:\n\n1. **Seeking professional help**: Working with a therapist or counselor can help you identify and address the root causes of your feelings of unworthiness. They can provide a safe and supportive environment to explore your emotions and develop coping strategies.\n2. **Practicing self-compassion**: Treat yourself with kindness, understanding, and patience. Acknowledge that your feelings of unworthiness are valid, but also recognize that they are not a reflection of your true worth as a person.\n3. **Challenging negative self-talk**: Become aware of your inner dialogue and challenge negative self-statements. Replace them with more balanced and realistic affirmations that promote self-acceptance and self-worth.\n4. **Focusing on small wins**: Celebrate small achievements and accomplishments, no matter how insignificant they may seem. This can help build confidence and self-esteem, which can, in turn, help you develop a sense of worthiness.\n5. **Cultivating a growth mindset**: View challenges and setbacks as opportunities for growth and learning, rather than as evidence of your unworthiness.\n\nIt's essential to recognize that internal validation is not about suddenly feeling worthy or deserving; it's about developing a more nuanced and compassionate relationship with yourself. It's about acknowledging that you are a complex, multifaceted individual with strengths and weaknesses, and that you deserve to be treated with kindness and respect \u2013 regardless of your perceived flaws or shortcomings.\n\nRemember, you don't have to believe you're worthy to start the journey of internal validation. You can start by simply acknowledging your existence and your humanity. You can start by recognizing that you are a unique and valuable individual, deserving of respect and compassion \u2013 not because of what you do or achieve, but because of who you are.\n\nAs you navigate this journey, be patient and gentle with yourself. It's a process that takes time, effort, and support. But with persistence and self-compassion, you can develop a more positive and accepting relationship with yourself, and cultivate a sense of internal validation that is authentic and empowering."

This is a common phenomenon, especially in cultures that emphasize meritocracy and achievement.\n\nThe idea that we must earn our worthiness through our actions, accomplishments, or contributions can be a challenging mindset to shift. It's as if we've been conditioned to believe that our existence is only justified by what we produce, achieve, or contribute to society.\n\nHowever, the concept of feeling deserving just for existing is rooted in a different paradigm. It's based on the idea that our worthiness is inherent, regardless of our actions or achievements. This perspective recognizes that every human being has inherent value and dignity, simply because they exist.\n\nAccessing this sense of worthiness without proof or external validation can be a challenging but ultimately liberating experience. Here are some insights that might help:\n\n1. **Recognize that your existence is a miracle**: Consider the improbability of your existence. The chances of you being born, with your unique genetic makeup, in this specific time and place, are incredibly low. Your existence is a remarkable event, and that in itself is worth acknowledging and appreciating.\n2. **Separate your worth from your actions**: Try to distinguish between your self-worth and your actions. Your worthiness is not defined by what you do or achieve, but by the fact that you exist. You are more than your accomplishments or failures.\n3. **Practice self-compassion**: Treat yourself with kindness, understanding, and patience. Acknowledge that you are a complex, multifaceted individual with strengths and weaknesses. Recognize that it's okay to make mistakes and that you are doing the best you can.\n4. **Connect with your inherent value**: Reflect on your values, passions, and interests. What brings you joy, excitement, or a sense of purpose? These aspects of yourself are a part of your inherent value, and they deserve to be acknowledged and nurtured.\n5. **Challenge societal expectations**: Question the societal norms and expectations that have led you to believe that your worthiness is tied to your productivity or achievements. Recognize that these expectations are often unrealistic and can be damaging to your mental and emotional well-being.\n6. **Cultivate mindfulness and presence**: Focus on the present moment, without judgment. Practice mindfulness and presence to connect with your inner self, and recognize that your existence is valid and worthy, regardless of what you're doing or achieving.\n7. **Seek out supportive relationships**: Surround yourself with people who support and accept you for who you are, without condition. Positive relationships can help you develop a sense of self-worth that is not dependent on external validation.\n\nRemember, accessing this sense of worthiness without proof or external validation is a journey, and it may take time.

It's as if your body is still holding onto the idea that you need permission or approval from others to be worthy or enough.\n\nThis resistance can be rooted in various factors, including:\n\n1. **Trauma**: Past experiences of trauma can lead to a deep-seated sense of unworthiness, shame, or self-doubt. This can cause your body to freeze or become hypervigilant, as if it's waiting for permission or approval to feel safe or worthy.\n2. **Habit**: Years of seeking external validation or trying to meet others' expectations can create a habit of seeking permission or approval. This can be a deeply ingrained pattern, making it challenging to break free from.\n3. **Societal conditioning**: The societal messages we receive from a young age can perpetuate the idea that we need to earn our worth or prove ourselves to be enough. This can lead to a sense of self-doubt or inadequacy, causing our bodies to freeze or seek permission.\n\nTo overcome this resistance, it's essential to acknowledge and work with your body's responses.

Remind yourself that your worth and value come from within, and that you don't need external validation to be worthy.\n5. **Small steps**: Take small steps towards asserting your worth and autonomy. Practice making decisions, setting boundaries, and taking care of yourself without seeking external permission.\n6. **Self-inquiry**: Explore the underlying beliefs and messages that contribute to your body's resistance. Ask yourself: What am I afraid of? What do I believe I need permission for? What would happen if I didn't seek permission?\n\nRemember, overcoming this resistance is a journey, and it's essential to be patient and compassionate with yourself.

With time, patience, and self-compassion, you can help your nervous system trust in unconditional rest and self-care.\n\nAs you navigate this journey, you might find it helpful to ask yourself:\n\n* What are the specific thoughts and feelings that arise when I try to rest or practice self-care?\n* How can I create a safe and comfortable environment that promotes relaxation and reduces stress?\n* What positive self-talk and affirmations can I use to help rewire my nervous system?\n* How can I challenge negative thoughts and reframe them in a more realistic and compassionate light?\n* What activities bring me joy and make me feel alive, and how can I incorporate them into my self-care practice?\n\nBy exploring these questions and working with your nervous system, you can begin to reteach it to trust in unconditional rest and self-care, and to believe that you deserve to rest and recharge without fear of punishment or negative consequences."

It's as if you're acknowledging that the guilt you feel when trying to rest is a complex and deeply ingrained emotion, tied to the sacrifices and efforts of those who have protected and cared for you in the past.\n\nHonoring the people and experiences that have protected you without letting the guilt run your whole life requires a nuanced and compassionate approach. It's essential to recognize that the guilt you feel is a natural response to the sacrifices and efforts of others, but it's also important to acknowledge that you can't repay those debts by sacrificing your own well-being.\n\nHere are some suggestions to help you honor what protected you without letting the guilt run your life:\n\n1. **Acknowledge and validate your feelings**: Recognize that your feelings of guilt are valid and understandable, given the sacrifices and efforts of those who have protected and cared for you. Acknowledge the debt you feel you owe, but also remind yourself that you can't repay it by sacrificing your own well-being.\n2. **Practice self-compassion**: Treat yourself with kindness, understanding, and patience, just as you would a close friend. Remind yourself that you're doing the best you can, and that it's okay to prioritize your own needs and well-being.\n3. **Reframe your relationship with guilt**: Instead of letting guilt dictate your actions, try to reframe it as a reminder of the love and care that has been shown to you. Recognize that the people who protected and cared for you wanted you to be happy and fulfilled, and that taking care of yourself is a way of honoring their efforts.\n4. **Develop a sense of gratitude**: Focus on the positive aspects of your relationships and experiences, and express gratitude for the love and care that has been shown to you. This can help shift your perspective and reduce feelings of guilt.\n5. **Set boundaries and prioritize self-care**: Establish clear boundaries and prioritize self-care to ensure that you're taking care of your physical, emotional, and mental well-being. This can help you feel more grounded and confident, and reduce feelings of guilt.\n6. **Create a new narrative**: Develop a new narrative that acknowledges the sacrifices and efforts of those who have protected and cared for you, but also recognizes your own agency and autonomy. Remind yourself that you're capable of making your own decisions and taking care of yourself.\n7. **Seek support**: Surround yourself with people who support and encourage your self-care practices, and who can help you develop a more positive and compassionate relationship with guilt.\n8. **Practice mindfulness and presence**: Cultivate mindfulness and presence by focusing on the present moment, without judgment. This can help you stay grounded and centered, and reduce feelings of guilt and anxiety.\n9. **Redefine what it means to honor your protectors**: Instead of trying to repay the debt you feel you owe by sacrificing your own well-being, try to redefine what it means to honor your protectors. Recognize that honoring them means taking care of yourself, pursuing your passions, and living a fulfilling life.\n10. **Remember that you can't pour from an empty cup**: Remind yourself that you can't take care of others or honor your protectors if you're not taking care of yourself. Prioritize your own well-being, and recognize that this is a necessary step in being able to show up for others and live a fulfilling life.\n\nRemember, honoring what protected you without letting the guilt run your life is a process that takes time, patience, and self-compassion. Be gentle with yourself, and don't expect to resolve this complex issue overnight.\n\nAs you navigate this journey, you might find it helpful to ask yourself:\n\n* What are the specific feelings and thoughts that arise when I try to rest or prioritize my own needs?\n* How can I reframe my relationship with guilt and develop a more positive and compassionate narrative?\n* What self-care practices can I prioritize to ensure that I'm taking care of my physical, emotional, and mental well-being?\n* How can I set boundaries and prioritize my own needs without feeling guilty or selfish?\n* What does it mean to me to honor my protectors, and how can I redefine this concept in a way that prioritizes my own well-being?\n\nBy exploring these questions and working with your emotions, you can begin to develop a more nuanced and compassionate relationship with guilt, and learn to honor what protected you without letting it run your whole life."

It's as if you're acknowledging that the guilt you carry is deeply tied to the people who taught you to endure, and that letting go of the guilt feels like a betrayal of their sacrifices and efforts.\n\nThis is a common phenomenon, especially for individuals who have experienced trauma or adversity. The guilt and shame that arise from these experiences can become deeply ingrained, making it challenging to distinguish between the guilt and the people who taught you to endure.\n\nHealing and letting go of guilt do not necessarily mean losing the people who taught you to endure. In fact, healing can often involve developing a more nuanced and compassionate understanding of these individuals and their experiences.\n\nTo tell the difference between losing them and finally seeing them clearly, consider the following:\n\n1. **Reflect on your motivations**: Ask yourself why you're holding onto the guilt. Is it because you feel a sense of responsibility or obligation to the people who taught you to endure? Or is it because you're trying to honor their memories or sacrifices? Clarifying your motivations can help you understand whether you're holding onto guilt out of loyalty or out of a desire to heal.\n2. **Examine your emotions**: Notice how you feel when you think about letting go of the guilt. Do you feel a sense of relief, freedom, or peace? Or do you feel anxious, guilty, or ashamed? Paying attention to your emotions can help you understand whether letting go of guilt is a positive or negative experience for you.\n3. **Consider the impact on your relationships**: Think about how letting go of guilt might affect your relationships with the people who taught you to endure. Will it bring you closer to them, or will it create distance? Will it allow you to see them more clearly, or will it obscure your understanding of them? Reflecting on the potential impact on your relationships can help you understand whether letting go of guilt is a positive or negative step.\n4. **Focus on the present moment**: Rather than dwelling on the past or worrying about the future, focus on the present moment. Ask yourself what you need to heal and move forward. What self-care practices, support systems, or therapies can help you process your emotions and develop a more compassionate understanding of yourself and others?\n5. **Practice self-compassion**: Treat yourself with kindness, understanding, and patience as you navigate this complex and emotional journey. Remember that healing is a process, and it's okay to take your time. Be gentle with yourself, and don't expect to resolve this issue overnight.\n\nRemember, healing and letting go of guilt do not mean erasing the past or forgetting the people who taught you to endure. Instead, it means developing a more nuanced and compassionate understanding of yourself and others, and learning to navigate the complexities of your emotions and relationships.\n\nAs you navigate this journey, you might find it helpful to ask yourself:\n\n* What are the specific emotions and thoughts that arise when I think about letting go of guilt?\n* How can I distinguish between the guilt and the people who taught me to endure?\n* What self-care practices and support systems can help me process my emotions and develop a more compassionate understanding of myself and others?\n* How can I focus on the present moment and prioritize my own healing and growth?\n* What does it mean to me to see the people who taught me to endure clearly, and how can I develop a more nuanced and compassionate understanding of them?\n\nBy exploring these questions and working with your emotions, you can begin to develop a more compassionate and nuanced understanding of yourself and others, and learn to distinguish between the guilt and the people who taught you to endure."

It's essential to acknowledge that people can be multifaceted, with both positive and negative qualities, and that these contradictions can coexist.\n\nGratitude and anger are not mutually exclusive emotions. In fact, they can coexist and even complement each other. Gratitude can acknowledge the positive aspects of a relationship or experience, while anger can recognize the harm or injustice that was inflicted.\n\nIt's possible to feel grateful for the ways in which these individuals cared for you, supported you, or taught you valuable skills, while also acknowledging the harm they caused or the ways in which they normalized toxic behaviors. This can be a challenging and complex emotional landscape to navigate, but it's essential for developing a more authentic and nuanced understanding of yourself and your relationships.\n\nConsider the following:\n\n1. **Gratitude is not the same as condoning**: Feeling grateful for certain aspects of a relationship or experience does not mean that you condone or excuse the harm that was inflicted. Gratitude can be a way of acknowledging the positive aspects of a complex situation, while also recognizing the harm that was done.\n2. **Anger is not the same as hatred**: Feeling angry about the harm that was inflicted does not mean that you hate the individuals who caused it. Anger can be a natural response to injustice or harm, and it can be a powerful motivator for creating positive change.\n3. **Emotions are not binary**: Emotions are not binary, and they can coexist in complex and nuanced ways. It's possible to feel both grateful and angry, or to experience a range of emotions that seem contradictory.\n4. **Context matters**: The context in which you experienced harm or trauma can influence the way you feel about the individuals who caused it. Consider the power dynamics, the cultural and social norms, and the historical context in which the harm was inflicted.\n5. **Healing is not about erasing the past**: Healing is not about erasing the past or forgetting the harm that was inflicted. Rather, it's about integrating the past into your present and future, and finding ways to move forward with greater awareness, compassion, and resilience.\n\nRemember, navigating complex emotions and relationships is a journey, and it's okay to take your time. Be patient and compassionate with yourself as you explore these nuances, and seek support from trusted friends, family, or mental health professionals when needed.\n\nAs you continue to navigate this journey, you might find it helpful to ask yourself:\n\n* What are the specific emotions and thoughts that arise when I think about the people who taught me to endure?\n* How can I acknowledge both the tenderness and the harm that these individuals normalized?\n* What does it mean to me to feel grateful and angry at the same time, and how can I integrate these emotions in a way that feels authentic and nuanced?\n* How can I prioritize my own healing and growth, while also acknowledging the complexities of my relationships and experiences?\n* What does it mean to me to see these individuals clearly, and how can I develop a more nuanced and compassionate understanding of them and their role in my life?\n\nBy exploring these questions and working with your emotions, you can begin to develop a more nuanced and compassionate understanding of yourself and your relationships, and find ways to integrate the past into your present and future with greater awareness and resilience."

Forgiveness is often misunderstood as being about the other person, about letting them off the hook or excusing their behavior. But forgiveness is actually about us, about our own healing and liberation. It's about releasing the hold that resentment and anger have on us, and finding a way to move forward with greater compassion and understanding.\n\nSoftening your own edges enough to breathe is a powerful metaphor for forgiveness. It suggests that forgiveness is not about changing the past or excusing the harm that was done, but about creating space for yourself to heal and move forward.
