Avoid bringing it up in public or when either of you is in a rush.\n2.  **Start with a positive tone**: Begin the conversation by expressing your appreciation for the person and your relationship with them. This can help set a positive tone for the rest of the conversation.\n3.  **Use \"I\" statements**: Instead of accusing or blaming the other person, use \"I\" statements to express your feelings and thoughts. For example, \"I felt hurt when I saw that meme\" rather than \"You hurt me with that meme.\"\n4.  **Focus on the issue, not the person**: Try to separate the issue from the person's identity or character. Avoid making assumptions or jumping to conclusions about their intentions or beliefs.\n5.  **Listen actively**: Make an effort to truly listen to the other person's perspective and respond thoughtfully.

While logic and rational thinking can play a role in understanding safety, it's often the emotional and physical sensations that ultimately determine how safe we feel.\n\n**The body remembers**: Traumatic experiences, especially those that occurred during formative years, can leave an imprint on the body's stress response system. This means that even if the logical part of the brain understands that the situation is no longer threatening, the body may still react as if it is.\n\n**Emotional safety is key**: Feeling safe is not just about thinking it, but also about experiencing it in the body. This can involve developing a sense of emotional regulation, where the body and mind work together to manage stress and anxiety.\n\n**Somatic experiences**: Engaging in activities that promote somatic awareness, such as mindfulness, yoga, or other forms of bodywork, can help the body develop a greater sense of safety and regulation. These practices can help the body learn to differentiate between past and present, allowing it to respond more appropriately to current situations.\n\n**Gradual exposure**: Gradually exposing yourself to situations or stimuli that trigger feelings of unsafety, while practicing self-care and emotional regulation, can help the body learn to feel safer over time.\n\n**It's a process**: Developing a sense of safety is a journey that takes time, patience, and self-compassion.

This can be a sign that your body is slowly becoming more resilient and better equipped to handle stress and anxiety.\n\n**The panic response is a natural reaction**: When faced with a perceived threat, the body's \"fight or flight\" response is triggered, releasing stress hormones like adrenaline and cortisol. This response is meant to be temporary, but for some people, it can become a habitual response to stress.\n\n**Learning to trust the calm**: While it's great that you're feeling safe after the panic passes, it's also important to learn to trust the calm moments. This can involve practicing relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or meditation, to help your body learn to recognize and trust the feeling of calm.\n\n**Building resilience**: By gradually exposing yourself to situations that trigger anxiety, while practicing self-care and emotional regulation, you can help your body build resilience and develop a greater sense of trust in its ability to handle stress.\n\n**Celebrating small wins**: Acknowledge and celebrate the small victories, even if it's just feeling safe for a few moments after the panic has passed.

This can help the body learn to associate calm with safety.\n*   **Reframe negative thoughts**: Challenge negative thoughts and reframe them in a more positive or neutral light. For example, instead of thinking \"the calm won't last,\" try thinking \"I'm feeling calm right now, and that's okay.\"\n*   **Build a support network**: Surround yourself with people who support and care for you, and who can help you feel safe and calm.\n*   **Practice self-care**: Engage in activities that bring you joy and help you relax, such as hobbies, exercise, or spending time with loved ones.\n\n**It's a process**: Healing and growth are not always linear, and it's okay to take things one step at a time.
