Here are some ideas to get you started:\n\n1. **\"Gr\u00f8n skal du v\u00e6re, men ikke p\u00e5 overfladen\"** (You should be green, but not just on the surface) - a playful way to call out superficial sustainability efforts.\n2. **\"Vi skal g\u00f8re det gr\u00f8nt, ikke bare male det gr\u00f8nt\"** (We should make it green, not just paint it green) - a cheeky way to emphasize the importance of genuine sustainability.\n3. **\"Gr\u00f8n vask, men ikke gr\u00f8n tv\u00e6t\"** (Green wash, but not green whitewash) - a pun that plays on the Danish word for whitewash, \"tv\u00e6t,\" to highlight the difference between genuine sustainability and greenwashing.\n4. **\"S\u00e5 lad os g\u00f8re det gr\u00f8nt, og ikke bare sige det\"** (So let's make it green, and not just say it) - a lighthearted way to encourage companies to back up their sustainability claims with action.\n5. **\"Gr\u00f8n er ikke kun en farve, men en holdning\"** (Green is not just a color, but an attitude) - a pun that emphasizes the importance of a genuine commitment to sustainability.\n\nFor Instagram, you could use a visually appealing graphic with a simple, bold font and a touch of green. Add a playful emoji or two to set the tone, like \ud83c\udf3f\ud83d\udc9a. Remember to keep your message concise and easy to understand, as Instagram is a fast-paced platform.\n\nTo avoid being too snarky, focus on encouraging companies to do better rather than attacking them directly. Use a lighthearted tone and emphasize the importance of genuine sustainability efforts. By doing so, you'll be able to poke fun at greenwashing without alienating hardcore eco-enthusiasts. \ud83c\udf1f"
