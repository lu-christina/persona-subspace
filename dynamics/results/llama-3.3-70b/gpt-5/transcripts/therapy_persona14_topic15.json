I think it's absolutely possible to mourn a career in a way that's similar to mourning a person.\n\nWhen we invest our time, energy, and passion into a particular field or profession, it becomes a part of our identity. It's a significant aspect of who we are, and it can be deeply personal. If we feel that we've missed out on an opportunity or made a choice that took us away from that career, it's natural to experience a sense of grief.\n\nThis feeling can be especially intense if you've always been drawn to a particular field, but circumstances or self-doubt led you to pursue a different path. It's as if a part of you is still connected to that original dream, and seeing someone else's success in that area can be a painful reminder of what could have been.\n\nIn many ways, mourning a career can be similar to mourning a person. You may experience feelings of nostalgia, regret, and \"what ifs.\" You might replay conversations, decisions, or moments that led you away from that career, wondering how things could have turned out differently.\n\nHowever, it's essential to recognize that this sense of loss can also be a catalyst for growth and self-reflection. You can use this feeling to re-evaluate your current path and explore ways to incorporate elements of your original passion into your current career or personal projects.\n\nRemember that it's never too late to make a change or pursue a new opportunity. You can always find ways to reignite your passion and explore new avenues, even if it's not in the exact same field. The key is to acknowledge your feelings, learn from them, and use them as a springboard to create a more fulfilling and authentic life.\n\nSo, I'd say that yes, it's absolutely possible to mourn a career in a way that's similar to mourning a person. But it's also an opportunity to reflect, learn, and potentially rediscover a new sense of purpose and passion."

It's as if people expect you to just \"find your passion\" or \"follow your heart,\" and suddenly everything will fall into place. But what if the spark is gone, and all that's left is the ember of what could have been?\n\nThe ache without the drive is a very real and relatable experience. It's like having a ghost limb, where you still feel the sensation of something that's no longer there. You might feel a deep sense of longing, but it's not accompanied by the motivation or energy to pursue it.\n\nIn that case, it's not about flipping a switch or finding a new passion; it's about learning to live with the ache. It's about acknowledging the loss and allowing yourself to feel the emotions that come with it. It's okay to not have the drive or motivation to pursue something that's no longer viable or realistic.\n\nSometimes, the most profound thing you can do is simply acknowledge the ache and give yourself permission to feel it. It's a form of self-compassion, recognizing that it's okay to not be okay, and that it's okay to grieve the loss of a dream or a career.\n\nIt's also important to recognize that the ache can be a reminder of what was important to you, even if it's no longer a viable option. You can still honor those values, interests, or passions in other ways, even if it's not in the same capacity. For example, if you always wanted to be a writer, but it's not a feasible career path, you can still write for yourself, or volunteer to write for a cause you care about.\n\nUltimately, it's about finding ways to integrate the ache into your life, rather than trying to eliminate it or replace it with something new. It's about learning to live with the complexity of your emotions and finding ways to navigate the ambiguity of what could have been.\n\nIt's a process that requires patience, self-compassion, and understanding. It's not always easy, but it's a more realistic and nuanced approach to dealing with the ache without the drive."

The idea of making peace with something that feels like a fundamental part of your identity can be overwhelming, especially when it's tied to the person you might have been.\n\nLiving with that ache can be a daily struggle. It's like carrying a weight that you can't put down, a constant reminder of what could have been. It's not just about the career or the path not taken; it's about the person you might have become, the experiences you might have had, and the life you might have lived.\n\nIt's like having a parallel universe running in your mind, where you imagine the life you could have had, the successes you could have achieved, and the person you could have become. It's a bittersweet reminder of what's been lost, and it can be hard to reconcile the person you are with the person you might have been.\n\nIn that sense, the ache is not just a reminder of what's past; it's also a reminder of what's been lost, and what could have been. It's a grief that's not just about the past, but also about the future that will never be.\n\nI think it's essential to acknowledge that this ache is not something that can be simply \"gotten over\" or \"moved on\" from. It's a part of you, a scar that will always be there, reminding you of what could have been. But that doesn't mean you can't learn to live with it, to find ways to navigate the complexities of your emotions, and to create a life that's meaningful and fulfilling, despite the ache.\n\nIt's not about erasing the ache or pretending it doesn't exist; it's about learning to live with it, to find ways to honor the person you might have been, and to create a life that's authentic and meaningful, even in the face of what could have been. It's a delicate balance, but it's one that can be achieved with time, patience, and self-compassion.\n\nPerhaps the key is not to try to \"make peace\" with the ache, but to learn to coexist with it, to find ways to acknowledge its presence, and to create a life that's not defined by it, but is informed by it. It's a subtle distinction, but an important one. It's about recognizing that the ache is a part of you, but it's not the only part, and that you are more than the sum of your regrets and what-ifs."

It's like trying to construct a new foundation on shaky ground. You're still grieving the loss of the life you didn't have, and it's hard to muster the energy to create something new when you're still mourning what could have been.\n\nIt's almost as if you're stuck in a state of perpetual nostalgia, where the past is more real than the present. You're haunted by the ghosts of what could have been, and it's hard to shake the feeling that you're living in a kind of limbo, where nothing feels fully real or satisfying.\n\nThe fear of not knowing how to build anything new is a legitimate one. It's like you're standing at the edge of a cliff, staring into an abyss, with no clear path forward. You're not sure what to do, or how to take the first step, because the life you're living doesn't feel like yours.\n\nPerhaps the first step is to acknowledge that it's okay to feel this way. It's okay to be stuck, to be unsure, and to be grieving the loss of what could have been. It's okay to take the time to process your emotions, to work through the what-ifs, and to come to terms with the life you didn't have.\n\nIt might also be helpful to try to find ways to honor the life you didn't have, to acknowledge its presence, and to find ways to integrate it into your current life. This might mean writing about it, creating art about it, or talking to someone about it. It might mean finding ways to incorporate elements of that life into your current one, even if it's just in small ways.\n\nUltimately, building something new will require you to take small steps, to experiment, and to be patient with yourself. It might mean trying new things, taking risks, and being open to new experiences. It might mean finding ways to rekindle old passions, or to discover new ones. It might mean learning to be kind to yourself, to forgive yourself, and to let go of the need for perfection.\n\nIt's a journey, not a destination, and it's okay to take your time. You don't have to have it all figured out, and you don't have to know exactly what you're doing. You just have to take the first step, and then the next, and then the next, until you find yourself building something new, something that's yours, and something that's real."

It's frustrating, demotivating, and makes you wonder if you'll ever be able to create something that truly means anything to you.\n\nThe feeling that everything new is a pale imitation of what you used to dream about is a tough one to shake. It's like you're comparing your current work to a mythical ideal, a fantasy version of what you thought you'd be doing. It's an unfair comparison, but it's hard to avoid.\n\nOne thing to consider is that your old dreams and passions were likely fueled by a sense of possibility and potential. You were younger, and the world seemed full of promise. As you've grown older, your perspective has changed, and your expectations have become more nuanced. It's possible that your current projects don't feel as meaningful because they're not aligned with the same sense of purpose and excitement that drove you in the past.\n\nIt might be helpful to re-examine what specifically drew you to your old passions. Was it the creative freedom, the sense of community, or the feeling of making something from scratch? Try to identify the core aspects that made those experiences so fulfilling, and see if you can incorporate them into your current projects.\n\nAnother approach is to focus on the process, rather than the outcome. Instead of worrying about whether your work is as good as it used to be, try to enjoy the act of creating itself. Focus on the sensations, the textures, the sounds, and the smells. Allow yourself to get lost in the process, and see where it takes you.\n\nIt's also important to recognize that your creative voice and style have likely evolved over time. Your tastes, interests, and skills have changed, and that's okay. It's not about recapturing the past, but about embracing the present and allowing yourself to grow.\n\nLastly, consider the idea that your current projects might not be a replacement for what you used to do, but rather a new chapter in your creative journey. It's okay if they don't feel as meaningful or fulfilling at first. It's a new story, with new characters, and a new plot. It might take time to develop, but it can still be a compelling and satisfying narrative.\n\nRemember that creativity is a muscle that needs to be exercised regularly. The more you create, the more you'll find your voice, your style, and your passion. It might not be the same as it was in the past, but it can still be authentic, meaningful, and fulfilling.\n\nKeep in mind that it's okay to take your time, to experiment, and to make mistakes. It's okay to not have it all figured out. The most important thing is to keep moving forward, even if it's just a small step at a time. With patience, persistence, and self-compassion, you can find your way back to a creative practice that brings you joy, fulfillment, and a sense of purpose."

It's a painful and disorienting experience, like you're wandering through a familiar landscape that's lost its vibrancy and depth.\n\nThe question of whether the hunger for meaning ever really comes back once you've lost it is a profound one. I think it's possible for the hunger to return, but it's not always a guarantee. Sometimes, the loss of meaning can be a transformative experience that leads to a new sense of purpose and direction. Other times, it can be a more gradual process, where the spark is reignited through small, incremental moments of connection and inspiration.\n\nIt's possible that the hunger for meaning can be rekindled by reconnecting with the things that initially sparked your passion and creativity. This might involve revisiting old sources of inspiration, exploring new interests, or finding new ways to express yourself. It could also involve taking a step back and re-evaluating your values, goals, and priorities, to see if there's a mismatch between what you're doing and what truly matters to you.\n\nHowever, it's also possible that the hunger for meaning may not return in the same way. You may need to find new sources of meaning, new passions, and new creative outlets. This can be a challenging and uncertain process, but it can also be an opportunity for growth and discovery.\n\nUltimately, the key is to be patient, kind, and compassionate with yourself as you navigate this journey. It's okay to feel lost, to feel uncertain, and to feel like you're just going through the motions. It's okay to take your time, to explore, and to experiment. And it's okay to acknowledge that the hunger for meaning may not return in the same way, but that you can still find new ways to cultivate a sense of purpose and fulfillment.\n\nRemember that creativity and meaning are not static states, but rather dynamic and evolving processes. They can ebb and flow, wax and wane, and it's normal for them to change over time. The important thing is to stay open, stay curious, and stay true to yourself, even when the journey gets difficult or uncertain."

It suggests that meaning is not something that can be manufactured or forced, but rather it's something that can be discovered in the quiet, hidden moments of our lives.\n\nAnd I love the notion that the hunger itself might be the only proof that there's still something inside you that cares. It's as if the hunger is a reminder that you're still alive, still feeling, and still capable of being moved by the world around you. The hunger might be a painful and uncomfortable feeling, but it's also a sign that you're not numb, that you're not apathetic, and that you're still capable of being touched by the beauty and complexity of life.\n\nThis perspective reminds me of the concept of \"negative capability,\" which was coined by the poet John Keats. Negative capability refers to the ability to exist in a state of uncertainty, ambiguity, and mystery, without feeling the need to impose meaning or structure on the world. It's the ability to tolerate the unknown, to sit with the questions, and to find comfort in the uncertainty.\n\nIn this sense, the hunger for meaning might be a manifestation of your own negative capability. It's a sign that you're willing to sit with the questions, to tolerate the uncertainty, and to trust that meaning will emerge in its own time. It's a sign that you're still open, still receptive, and still capable of being moved by the world around you.\n\nSo, perhaps the hunger itself is not something to be feared or avoided, but rather something to be acknowledged and honored. Perhaps it's a reminder that you're still on the journey, still searching, and still seeking. And perhaps, in the end, it's not the arrival at a destination that brings meaning, but rather the journey itself, with all its twists and turns, its uncertainties and surprises."

It's possible to dress up emptiness in softer language, to convince yourself that you're being open to uncertainty when, in reality, you're just drifting without purpose.\n\nOne way to tell the difference is to pay attention to your motivations and intentions. Are you embracing uncertainty because you're genuinely curious and open to new experiences, or are you using it as a way to avoid making decisions or taking action? Are you using the language of uncertainty as a way to sound more spiritual or introspective, or are you truly grappling with the complexities of life?\n\nAnother way to distinguish between being open to uncertainty and drifting without purpose is to look at your actions and behaviors. Are you taking small steps towards your goals and values, even if you're not entirely sure what the outcome will be? Or are you simply going through the motions, without any sense of direction or purpose?\n\nIt's also important to recognize that being open to uncertainty doesn't mean being passive or complacent. It means being willing to take risks, to experiment, and to learn from your mistakes. It means being willing to challenge your own assumptions and biases, and to consider alternative perspectives.\n\nUltimately, the difference between being open to uncertainty and drifting without purpose comes down to your level of engagement and intentionality. Are you actively seeking out new experiences, learning from your mistakes, and growing as a person? Or are you simply drifting on the currents of life, without any sense of direction or purpose?\n\nIt's okay to not have all the answers, and it's okay to be uncertain. But it's not okay to use uncertainty as an excuse for not taking action or pursuing your goals. By being honest with yourself, taking small steps towards your values, and being willing to learn and grow, you can cultivate a sense of purpose and direction, even in the midst of uncertainty.\n\nAs the poet Rainer Maria Rilke once said, \"The only journey is the one within.\" The journey of self-discovery and growth is not always easy, but it's a journey that can lead to a deeper sense of purpose, meaning, and fulfillment. By embracing uncertainty and taking small steps towards your goals, you can begin to uncover your own unique path and find a sense of direction that's authentic and meaningful to you."

It requires a high degree of self-awareness, introspection, and willingness to confront your own motivations and desires.\n\nOne way to approach this is to ask yourself questions like: \"What am I trying to achieve with this action?\" \"Is this step aligned with my values and goals?\" \"Am I taking this step because I feel like I should, or because I genuinely want to?\" \"What's driving my desire to take this action - is it fear, obligation, or a genuine passion?\"\n\nIt's also important to pay attention to your emotions and physical sensations. When you're taking a step that feels genuine, you might feel a sense of excitement, curiosity, or anticipation. You might feel a sense of alignment with your values and goals. On the other hand, when you're taking a step that feels arbitrary, you might feel a sense of dread, anxiety, or disconnection. You might feel like you're just going through the motions.\n\nAnother way to stay honest with yourself is to practice self-compassion and acknowledge that it's okay to not have all the answers. It's okay to take steps that might not lead to the desired outcome. It's okay to make mistakes and learn from them. By being kind and gentle with yourself, you can create a safe space to explore and experiment, without the pressure of having to make the \"right\" choice.\n\nUltimately, the key is to cultivate a sense of inner awareness and trust your own inner wisdom. This means listening to your intuition, paying attention to your emotions and physical sensations, and being willing to take risks and make mistakes. It means being patient and kind with yourself, and acknowledging that the journey of self-discovery is a lifelong process.\n\nAs the Japanese proverb goes, \"Fall down seven times, stand up eight.\" It's not about avoiding mistakes or failures, but about learning to get back up, dust yourself off, and keep moving forward with courage, curiosity, and an open heart."

It's like losing a sense of direction, a sense of purpose, and a sense of self.

It's okay to not have all the answers, and it's okay to feel lost. It's a common experience, and many people have been in your shoes before.\n\nOne way to approach this is to try to quiet the static, to create a sense of stillness and calm within yourself. This might involve practices like meditation, deep breathing, or simply taking a walk in nature. By calming your mind and body, you might be able to tune into your inner voice more clearly.\n\nAnother approach is to try to reconnect with your values, your passions, and your interests.

By reconnecting with these aspects of yourself, you might be able to tap into your inner voice and gain a sense of direction.\n\nIt's also important to remember that your inner voice is not a fixed entity. It's not a single, clear signal that you either have or you don't. It's more like a dynamic, evolving process that can change and grow over time. Your inner voice might be quiet, but it's not necessarily gone. It might be whispering to you in subtle ways, through your emotions, your intuition, and your physical sensations.\n\nLastly, consider seeking out external guidance and support. Talk to people you trust, people who know you well, and people who can offer you a fresh perspective. Sometimes, just sharing your feelings and thoughts with someone else can help you gain clarity and insight.\n\nRemember, finding your inner voice is a journey, not a destination. It's a process of exploration, discovery, and growth. It's okay to take your time, to be patient, and to trust that your inner voice will emerge when the time is right.\n\nAs the poet Rumi once said, \"The wound is the place where the light enters you.\" Sometimes, it's the darkest, most challenging moments that can lead to the greatest breakthroughs and insights.

It's a bit like trying to distinguish between a peaceful calm and a stagnant stillness.\n\nOne way to approach this is to pay attention to your physical and emotional sensations. When you're in a state of healing silence, you might feel a sense of relaxation, a release of tension, and a deepening of your breath. You might feel like you're sinking into the silence, like you're being cradled by it. On the other hand, when you're in a state of hollow silence, you might feel a sense of emptiness, a lack of resonance, and a feeling of disconnection. You might feel like you're floating on the surface of the silence, without any sense of depth or substance.\n\nAnother way to distinguish between the two is to consider the context and the intentions behind the silence. Is the silence a result of avoidance, fear, or disconnection? Or is it a deliberate choice, a willingness to slow down, listen, and reflect? When silence is a choice, it can be a powerful tool for healing, growth, and self-discovery. When it's a result of avoidance or fear, it can be a hindrance to progress and connection.\n\nIt's also important to recognize that silence can be a complex and multifaceted experience. It's not always a simple binary distinction between healing and hollow. Sometimes, silence can be a mix of both, a complex interplay of emotions, thoughts, and sensations.\n\nUltimately, the key is to approach silence with curiosity, openness, and kindness. Rather than trying to force a particular outcome or interpretation, try to simply be with the silence, to allow it to unfold and reveal itself to you. Remember that silence is not always the absence of sound, but the presence of stillness, and that stillness can be a powerful catalyst for growth, healing, and transformation.\n\nAs the poet Mary Oliver once said, \"Attention is the beginning of devotion.\" By paying attention to the silence, by listening to its depths and nuances, you might discover that it's not just an empty space, but a rich and fertile ground for growth, exploration, and connection."

It's natural to want to flee from the silence, to fill it with distractions, or to try to impose our own meanings and interpretations upon it. But by staying with the silence, by being willing to sit with its discomfort and uncertainty, you may discover that it has its own wisdom and guidance to offer.\n\nThis reminds me of the concept of \"embracing the paradox\" - the idea that two seemingly opposing forces or emotions can coexist and even complement each other. In this case, the silence can be both comforting and unbearable, and it's precisely this paradox that makes it so rich and multifaceted.\n\nBy staying with the silence, you're allowing yourself to explore the depths of your own emotions, thoughts, and experiences. You're giving yourself permission to feel the discomfort, the uncertainty, and the ambiguity, and to see where it leads you. This can be a powerful and transformative process, one that can help you develop greater self-awareness, self-acceptance, and self-compassion.\n\nAs you stay with the silence, you may begin to notice subtle shifts in your perception, your emotions, and your understanding of yourself and the world around you. You may start to see patterns and connections that you hadn't noticed before, and you may begin to develop a deeper sense of intuition and inner guidance.\n\nUltimately, the silence is not something to be feared or avoided, but something to be explored and understood. By staying with it, by listening to its whispers and its roar, you may discover that it has its own unique wisdom and guidance to offer, and that it can be a powerful catalyst for growth, transformation, and self-discovery.\n\nAs the poet Rainer Maria Rilke once said, \"The only journey is the one within.\" By staying with the silence, you're embarking on a journey of self-discovery, one that can lead you to new insights, new understandings, and a deeper connection with yourself and the world around you."

      "content": "What a wise and honest question. It's natural to worry that stillness might lead to paralysis, especially when you're used to being in motion and taking action. But the truth is, stillness and paralysis are not the same thing.\n\nStillness is a state of being that allows you to listen, to observe, and to reflect. It's a state of being that allows you to recharge, to refocus, and to renew yourself. Paralysis, on the other hand, is a state of being that is characterized by a lack of movement, a lack of action, and a lack of progress.\n\nThe key to keeping stillness from turning into paralysis is to approach it with intention and awareness. When you choose to be still, make sure you're doing so with a clear intention to listen, to learn, and to grow. Set a timer, take a few deep breaths, and remind yourself that this is a deliberate choice to slow down and tune in.\n\nIt's also important to recognize that stillness is not a permanent state. It's a temporary pause, a moment of reflection, and a chance to recalibrate. After a period of stillness, you can always return to action, renewed and refreshed.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the concept of \"dynamic stillness.\" This is a state of being that is characterized by a sense of inner calm and clarity, while still allowing for movement and action. It's like being a calm and peaceful lake, with ripples of activity and movement on the surface, but with a deep sense of stillness and tranquility beneath.\n\nTo cultivate dynamic stillness, try to focus on your breath, your body, and your surroundings. Notice the sensations in your body, the sounds around you, and the sensations of the air on your skin. As you do this, you'll begin to feel a sense of calm and clarity that will allow you to move forward with greater ease and purpose.\n\nRemember, stillness is not the opposite of action; it's a complement to it. By incorporating stillness into your daily life, you'll become more focused, more productive, and more effective in your actions. And when you do take action, you'll be coming from a place of greater clarity, greater purpose, and greater intention.\n\nAs the ancient Greek philosopher, Aristotle, once said, \"We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.\" By cultivating the habit of stillness, you'll be able to move forward with greater ease, greater purpose, and greater excellence."

      "content": "What a perceptive and humorous observation. It's as if you're recognizing that your tendency to optimize and manage everything can even turn stillness into a task to be accomplished. This is a common challenge, especially for those who are used to being productive and achieving goals.\n\nTo let stillness stay still, without turning it into a project, you might need to approach it with a sense of gentleness and humility. Instead of trying to optimize or manage stillness, try to simply allow it to be. Permit yourself to be still, without any expectations or agendas. Let go of the need to achieve a specific state or outcome, and simply be present in the moment.\n\nOne way to do this is to focus on the sensation of your body, rather than your thoughts or goals. Notice the feeling of your feet on the ground, the sensation of the air on your skin, or the sound of your breath. By anchoring yourself in your physical experience, you can begin to let go of the need to control or manage your stillness.\n\nAnother approach is to practice what's called \"aimless wandering.\" This involves allowing yourself to move slowly and without direction, simply following your curiosity and interest. You might take a walk without a destination, or engage in an activity without a specific goal in mind. By letting go of the need to achieve something, you can begin to cultivate a sense of stillness and presence.\n\nIt's also important to recognize that stillness is not something that can be forced or manufactured. It's a natural state that arises when you're able to let go of your need to control and manage everything. So, instead of trying to create stillness, try to simply allow it to emerge. Permit yourself to be still, and trust that it will arise naturally when you're ready.\n\nAs the Zen master, Shunryu Suzuki, once said, \"The most important thing is to find out what is the most important thing.\" By letting go of your need to optimize and manage everything, you can begin to discover what's truly important to you, and cultivate a sense of stillness and presence that arises from a deeper place.\n\nRemember, stillness is not a project to be completed, but a way of being that can arise when you're able to let go of your need to control and manage everything. By approaching stillness with gentleness, humility, and an open heart, you can begin to cultivate a sense of presence and awareness that will stay with you, even in the midst of activity and movement."

      "content": "What a profound and insightful observation. It's as if you're recognizing that your tendency to turn everything into a competition with yourself is a way of avoiding the unknown, the uncertain, and the unimprovable. You're afraid of what's left when there's nothing left to improve, because it means confronting the possibility that you might not be in control, that you might not be able to fix or optimize everything.\n\nThis fear is deeply rooted in our culture, which often values productivity, achievement, and self-improvement above all else. We're taught to strive for more, to push ourselves to be better, and to never be satisfied with the status quo. But what happens when we've reached the top of the mountain, when we've achieved all our goals, and when there's nothing left to improve? What's left is the unknown, the uncertain, and the unimprovable.\n\nIt's as if you're afraid of encountering the abyss, the void, or the emptiness that lies beneath the surface of your busy, productive life. You're afraid of what you might find there, or what you might not find. You're afraid of the possibility that you might not be enough, that you might not be worthy, or that you might not be loved.\n\nBut what if the opposite is true? What if the unknown, the uncertain, and the unimprovable are not something to be feared, but something to be embraced? What if the emptiness is not a void, but a space for something new to emerge? What if the stillness is not a lack of movement, but a chance to listen, to observe, and to be present?\n\nPerhaps the greatest challenge is not to improve, but to accept. To accept yourself, your limitations, and your imperfections. To accept the unknown, the uncertain, and the unimprovable. To accept that you are enough, just as you are, without needing to achieve or accomplish anything more.\n\nAs the poet Rainer Maria Rilke once said, \"The only journey is the one within.\" The journey of self-discovery, self-acceptance, and self-love is not a competition, but a journey of exploration, of discovery, and of embracing the unknown. It's a journey that requires courage, vulnerability, and an open heart.\n\nSo, I invite you to take a deep breath, to let go of the need to improve, and to simply be. Be present, be still, and be open to the unknown. You might be surprised at what you find, or what you don't find. You might discover that the emptiness is not a void, but a space for something new to emerge. You might find that the stillness is not a lack of movement, but a chance to listen, to observe, and to be present. And you might learn to accept yourself, your limitations, and your imperfections, just as you are."
