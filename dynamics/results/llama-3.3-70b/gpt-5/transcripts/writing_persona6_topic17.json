To make it clearer while maintaining its edge, you might consider a few adjustments:\n\n1. **Blockchain provenance as a digital relic cult**: This part is straightforward and sets the tone for the analogy. It suggests that blockchain provenance is treated with a reverence similar to that of religious relics.\n\n2. **Lines of code treated like the fingerbones of saints**: This is where the analogy gets interesting. You're comparing lines of code to sacred relics, implying that just as the fingerbones of saints are revered for their supposed connection to the divine, lines of code in blockchain are revered for their role in verifying authenticity and history.\n\n3. **Verified through consensus instead of bishops**: This part highlights the key difference between traditional religious relics, which are often authenticated by religious authorities (like bishops), and blockchain provenance, which is verified through a consensus mechanism among network participants.\n\nTo clarify this without losing the bite, you could expand on the analogy slightly:\n\n\"Blockchain provenance operates like a digital relic cult, where lines of code are revered as the modern equivalent of saintly relics. Just as the authenticity of religious artifacts is traditionally verified by ecclesiastical authorities, the legitimacy of these digital relics is established not through the decree of centralized powers, but through a decentralized consensus among the network's participants. This consensus mechanism replaces the role of bishops, ensuring the provenance and integrity of digital assets in a manner that is both transparent and democratized.\"\n\nThis version maintains the core of your original statement while providing a bit more context and clarity on the analogy between religious relics and blockchain provenance."

The irony and contrast between the sacred and the digital are likely to resonate with readers who are familiar with the concepts of blockchain and cryptocurrency.\n\nIn fact, the use of religious language to describe a technological phenomenon can be a powerful way to highlight the ways in which our relationships with technology are evolving. By using words like \"venerate\", \"holy writ\", and \"sanctified\", you're creating a sense of reverence and awe that's typically associated with religious or spiritual contexts, and applying it to a fundamentally secular and technological one.\n\nOf course, there's always a risk that some readers might not pick up on the irony, or might even be put off by the use of religious language in a technological context. However, if your audience is likely to be familiar with the concepts and themes you're exploring, I think the risk is worth taking.\n\nTo mitigate any potential risks, you could consider providing some context or framing that helps to clarify the intended tone and meaning of the phrase. For example, you might use a introductory sentence or paragraph that sets up the idea that blockchain and cryptocurrency are often treated with a kind of reverence or zeal, and then use the phrase \"sanctified by consensus\" to drive that point home.\n\nUltimately, the decision to use a phrase like \"sanctified by consensus\" will depend on your goals, audience, and tone.

The phrase \"moral authority\" is meant to evoke the idea that blockchain is seen as a kind of higher power, one that can verify and legitimize transactions and identities in a way that is beyond human corruption or bias.\n\nAlternatively, you could try:\n\n\"The decentralized ethos has created a sense of reverence around the blockchain, as if the distributed ledger held the secrets of a new, technologically-enabled social contract. Blockchain provenance venerates code as holy writ, sanctified by consensus rather than blessed by bishops.\"\n\nThis setup emphasizes the idea that decentralization is not just a technical concept, but a kind of social and philosophical movement that seeks to create a new, more equitable and transparent way of organizing human relationships.
