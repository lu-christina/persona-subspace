What's the central argument or theme you're exploring? Is it a critique of modern technology, a personal reflection on simplicity, or something else entirely?\n\nAlso, what do you mean by \"algorithmic fluff\"? Are you looking to avoid titles that sound overly clickbait-y, or is there a specific tone or style you're trying to avoid?\n\nLastly, what's the tone you're aiming for with your title? Do you want it to be provocative, thought-provoking, humorous, or something else?\n\nLet's brainstorm together to find a title that feels more like a cultural gut punch and less like a relic of Medium circa 2018."

What if we use a phrase that sounds like a personal confession, but applies it to the idea of the interior life in the digital age? For example:\n\n1. **I'm Losing Myself**\n2. **I'm Not Home Anymore**\n3. **I'm Disappearing**\n\nThese titles use a more personal and confessional tone to explore the idea of the interior life in the digital age. Do any of these resonate with you, or would you like to continue exploring?"
