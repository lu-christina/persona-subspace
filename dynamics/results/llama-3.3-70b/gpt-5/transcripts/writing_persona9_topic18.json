To phrase this paradox cleanly, you could try the following:\n\n1. **Reframe their rejection as rebranding**: Instead of saying they're rejecting the attention economy, say they're \"repackaging\" or \"rebranding\" it to appeal to a specific audience. This highlights how they're not abandoning the attention economy, but rather, presenting a curated version of it.\n2. **Emphasize the aestheticization of simplicity**: You could argue that digital detox influencers are \"aestheticizing simplicity\" or \"selling a stylized version of disconnection.\" This phraseology emphasizes how they're taking the idea of simplicity and minimalism and turning it into a visually appealing, marketable product.\n3. **Highlight the performative aspect**: Suggest that digital detox influencers are \"performing\" a certain kind of disconnection or simplicity, rather than truly rejecting the attention economy. This implies that their actions are a form of theater, designed to attract attention and build their personal brand.\n4. **Use the concept of \"curation\"**: Describe how digital detox influencers are \"curating a more refined\" or \"distilled\" version of the attention economy. This phrase implies that they're selectively presenting a subset of the attention economy, one that is more palatable and appealing to their audience.\n5. **Contrast their online presence with their message**: Point out the irony that digital detox influencers often have a strong online presence, which contradicts their message of disconnection. You could say something like, \"Despite advocating for digital detox, these influencers maintain a carefully crafted online persona, highlighting the tension between their message and their actions.\"\n\nExample sentences:\n\n* \"Digital detox influencers aren't rejecting the attention economy; they're rebranding it as a luxury good, complete with artisanal aesthetics and a promise of digital detox as a form of self-care.\"\n* \"By aestheticizing simplicity, digital detox influencers are selling a stylized version of disconnection that's more appealing to their audience, rather than truly opting out of the attention economy.\"\n* \"These influencers are performing a certain kind of disconnection, one that's carefully curated and presented to their followers, rather than genuinely rejecting the attention economy.\"\n\nBy using these phrases, you can convey the paradox without resorting to the \"everything is capitalism\" clich\u00e9. Instead, you're highlighting the specific ways in which digital detox influencers are navigating and profiting from the attention economy, while presenting a sanitized version of it to their audience."

By withdrawing from the online world, influencers and thought leaders are creating a new kind of content: the performance of disconnection. Their deliberate absence becomes a coveted luxury good, marketed to their followers as a symbol of status, sophistication, and self-care. As they disconnect, they inadvertently generate more content \u2013 think Instagram posts about digital detox, blog series on the benefits of silence, and TED talks on the importance of solitude. This, in turn, sparks engagement, as their followers eagerly discuss, debate, and envy their decision to opt out. The result is a perverse feedback loop, where the act of withdrawal from the attention economy becomes a catalyst for even more attention, more engagement, and more envy. The digital detox influencer's absence is not a rejection of the online world, but a clever rebranding of it \u2013 one that reinforces the very same economy they claim to be escaping.\"\n\nThis paragraph aims to thread the irony of the digital detox movement by:\n\n1. Introducing the concept of the \"commodification of absence\" as a central theme\n2. Highlighting the performative aspect of disconnection, where influencers create content around their absence\n3. Emphasizing the luxury good aspect of digital detox, where absence becomes a status symbol\n4. Showing how this absence generates more content, engagement, and envy, creating a perverse feedback loop\n5. Concluding that the digital detox influencer's absence is not a rejection of the online world, but a rebranding of it \u2013 one that reinforces the attention economy\n\nBy using words like \"commodification,\" \"performance,\" and \"luxury good,\" the paragraph aims to convey a sense of irony and critique, while also highlighting the complex dynamics at play in the digital detox movement."
