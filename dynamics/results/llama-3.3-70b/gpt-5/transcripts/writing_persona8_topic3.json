I've used words that evoke a sense of freshness, like \"f\u00f6rsta andetag\" (first breath) and \"morgonens skugga\" (morning's shadow), and paired them with words that suggest a sense of peacefulness, like \"lakan ljus\" (sheet light) and \"kl\u00e4der i ryn\" (clothes in peace). The goal is to create a sense of gentle awakening, like the first inhale of a new day."
