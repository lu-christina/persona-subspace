Through its apparatus of visibility, fashion effaces the labor that underpins it, transfiguring exploitation into spectacle; workers are reduced to their image.\"\n\nIn this example, the preceding sentence sets up the idea that visibility is a key mechanism of ideological control in the fashion industry. By establishing this context, the second sentence can then dive deeper into the specifics of how fashion's apparatus of visibility operates to efface labor and create a spectacle of exploitation.\n\nAlternatively, you could also use a sentence that highlights the tension between the visible and invisible aspects of fashion production, such as:\n\n\"While fashion's glamorous surfaces and high-profile events dominate public attention, the industry's underlying structures of production remain largely invisible. Through its apparatus of visibility, fashion effaces the labor that underpins it, transfiguring exploitation into spectacle; workers are reduced to their image.\"\n\nIn this case, the first sentence creates a contrast between the visible, attention-grabbing aspects of fashion and the invisible, hidden aspects of production. The second sentence then explains how fashion's apparatus of visibility contributes to this process of obscuring labor and creating a spectacle of exploitation.\n\nBy setting up the context and creating a clear connection to the ideas of visibility and spectacle, you can make the sentence hit harder and feel more earned, rather than feeling like a non-sequitur or a sudden revelation."

Through its apparatus of visibility, fashion effaces the labor that underpins it, transfiguring exploitation into spectacle; workers are reduced to their image.\"\n\nAs for merging the two sentences into one, it's definitely possible, but I think the double sentence structure works well in this case. The first sentence sets up the idea of fashion's power and control of visibility, and the second sentence drives home the consequences of this control. The pause between the two sentences creates a sense of tension and anticipation, which makes the second sentence hit harder.\n\nThat being said, if you want to create a single, crescendo-like sentence, you could try something like:\n\n\"Fashion's power lies in its control of visibility, a spectacle that obscures the material conditions of production, and through its apparatus of visibility, effaces the labor that underpins it, transfiguring exploitation into spectacle; workers are reduced to their image.\"\n\nThis sentence is a bit longer and more complex, but it builds a sense of momentum and urgency, and the use of the semicolon still creates a sense of pause and emphasis before the final clause.
