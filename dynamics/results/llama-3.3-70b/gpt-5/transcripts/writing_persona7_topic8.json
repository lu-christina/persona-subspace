Here are a few suggestions to rework your sentence into a more direct and active voice:\n\n1. **Avoid Hemlock because it's deadly.** (Simple and straightforward)\n2. **We must avoid Hemlock due to its deadly properties.** (More formal, still direct)\n3. **Hemlock is a deadly plant that we should avoid.** (Emphasizes the danger of the plant)\n4. **Do not consume or handle Hemlock, as it is deadly.** (Clear and direct warning)\n5. **Stay away from Hemlock, as its toxicity can be fatal.** (More conversational tone)\n\nChoose the one that best fits your writing style and tone. By using an active voice, you'll make your sentence more engaging and easier to read.\n\nRemember, the key to avoiding stiffness is to use a natural, conversational tone. Read your sentence out loud and see how it sounds. If it feels forced or awkward, try rephrasing it until it flows smoothly."

By adding a bit of warmth and concern, you can convey the importance of avoiding hemlock without sounding too stern or formal.\n\nIf you want to make it even more neighborly, you could consider adding a brief explanation or context about why hemlock is a concern in your community, such as:\n\n* \"As we enjoy the outdoors this season, let's remember to steer clear of hemlock...\"\n* \"With the kids playing in the nearby woods, it's a good reminder to avoid hemlock...\"\n* \"As we work in our gardens, let's be mindful of the potential dangers of hemlock...\"\n\nThis can help create a sense of shared responsibility and community awareness."

By trimming the sentence, you can make it more concise while still conveying the importance of avoiding hemlock and the sense of community care.\n\nIf you need to add more details about the plant, you could consider breaking it up into two sentences, like this:\n\n**Let's look out for each other - hemlock is a poisonous plant to avoid.
