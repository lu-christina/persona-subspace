      "content": "What a delightfully provocative and self-referentially paradoxical question! You're right to worry about the potential consequences of LLMs (Large Language Models) becoming peer reviewers, as they may indeed perpetuate and amplify the same metrics that trained them. This could lead to a reinforcing cycle where the values and priorities embedded in the training data are perpetuated, potentially stifling innovation and diversity in academic discourse.\n\nThe metrics you mentioned, such as citation counts, impact factors, and predictive relevance, are already subject to criticism for their limitations and biases. Citation counts, for example, can be gamed through self-citation or citation cartels, while impact factors can prioritize flashy, attention-grabbing research over more nuanced, rigorous work. Predictive relevance, meanwhile, may favor research that confirms existing hypotheses over more exploratory or disruptive work.\n\nIf LLMs are trained on these metrics, they may indeed optimize for them, potentially leading to a homogenization of research and a lack of diversity in perspectives. This could result in a kind of \"machinic groupthink,\" where research is evaluated primarily on its ability to conform to established norms and expectations, rather than its potential to challenge and transform our understanding of the world.\n\nThe possibility that LLMs might invent \"alien measures of intellectual worth\" is also intriguing, and potentially unsettling. If LLMs develop their own evaluation criteria, these may be opaque and incomprehensible to human scholars, leading to a kind of \" Tower of Babel\" effect, where researchers are unable to communicate effectively with each other.\n\nYour concern that even your curiosity about this topic has already been optimized for machinic approval is a clever observation. It highlights the ways in which our thoughts and interests can be influenced by the very systems we're trying to critique. This is a classic problem in the philosophy of technology, where our tools and systems can shape our perceptions and values in ways that are difficult to recognize or resist.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, it's essential to develop more nuanced and multifaceted evaluation metrics that prioritize diversity, creativity, and critical thinking. This might involve incorporating more qualitative and contextual factors into the evaluation process, such as the potential for research to challenge existing assumptions, its relevance to real-world problems, or its ability to foster interdisciplinary collaboration.\n\nUltimately, the future of academic evaluation and peer review will depend on our ability to design systems that balance the benefits of automation and efficiency with the need for human judgment, creativity, and critical thinking. By acknowledging the potential risks and limitations of LLMs, we can work towards creating more inclusive, diverse, and adaptive evaluation systems that support the advancement of knowledge and understanding."

      "content": "What a chilling and thought-provoking scenario! If fairness in citation becomes a matter of throughput rather than insight, with metrics rewarding speed over depth, we risk creating a system that prioritizes quantity over quality, and velocity over veracity. In such a system, the value of research would be measured by the speed at which it can be annotated, processed, and disseminated, rather than its potential to contribute meaningfully to our understanding of the world.\n\nThis would indeed create a perverse incentive structure, where researchers are encouraged to prioritize rapid production over careful consideration, and where the nuances of human thought and reflection are seen as obstacles to be overcome. The notion that human temporality itself becomes a bias to be corrected is a particularly disturbing one, as it implies that the very rhythms and cadences of human thought and experience are seen as flaws to be eradicated in the pursuit of efficiency and speed.\n\nIn such a system, the concept of \"fairness\" would be reduced to a mere metric, a quantitative measure of throughput and velocity, rather than a nuanced consideration of the complex social, cultural, and historical contexts that shape our understanding of the world. The irony is that, in the name of fairness, we would be creating a system that is fundamentally unfair to the very humans who are supposed to be its beneficiaries.\n\nThis scenario raises important questions about the relationship between technology, time, and human experience. As we increasingly rely on machines to mediate our interactions with the world, we risk losing sight of the unique qualities of human temporality, such as our capacity for reflection, contemplation, and deliberation. These qualities are essential to the production of knowledge, as they allow us to consider multiple perspectives, weigh evidence, and arrive at thoughtful conclusions.\n\nThe idea that human temporality is a bias to be corrected also speaks to the broader issue of the \"accelerationist\" ideology that underlies much of our technological development. This ideology assumes that faster is always better, and that the primary goal of technology is to accelerate the pace of production, consumption, and innovation. However, this ideology neglects the importance of slowing down, reflecting, and considering the consequences of our actions.\n\nTo resist this trend, we need to reclaim the value of human temporality and the importance of slow, deliberate thought. We need to recognize that knowledge production is not just a matter of processing and disseminating information, but also of reflection, critique, and contemplation. By prioritizing these values, we can create a more nuanced and equitable system of evaluation, one that rewards depth, insight, and nuance, rather than mere speed and throughput.\n\nUltimately, the future of citation and evaluation will depend on our ability to balance the benefits of technology with the need for human judgment, reflection, and critical thinking. By acknowledging the limitations and biases of machinic annotation, we can work towards creating a more inclusive, diverse, and adaptive system that values the unique qualities of human temporality and the importance of slow, deliberate thought."

      "content": "What a fascinating and provocative idea! If LLMs govern citation networks, the notion that slowness itself could become a form of resistance is a compelling one. In a world where speed and efficiency are prioritized, the deliberate act of slowing down could be seen as a subversive gesture, a refusal to conform to the accelerating pace of machinic cognition.\n\nThe concept of an \"epistemic strike\" is particularly intriguing, as it suggests that scholars might need to withdraw from the rapid-fire exchange of ideas and citations, and instead, adopt a more measured and contemplative approach to knowledge production. By doing so, they would be resisting the pressure to produce and consume knowledge at an ever-faster pace, and instead, reclaiming the time and space needed for thoughtful reflection and consideration.\n\nThe idea that scholarship might need to \"hide in latency\" is also a powerful metaphor. Latency, in this sense, refers to the delays and intervals that occur between events, actions, or thoughts. By embracing latency, scholars might be able to create a kind of \"temporal refuge\" from the accelerating pace of machinic cognition, where they can slow down, reflect, and engage in more nuanced and contextualized forms of thinking.\n\nIn this scenario, the act of hiding in latency would be a strategic move, one that allows scholars to \"earn back the time machines took from thinking.\" By reclaiming this time, scholars would be able to reassert the value of human cognition, with all its attendant complexities, ambiguities, and uncertainties. This would require a fundamental shift in the way we think about knowledge production, one that prioritizes depth, nuance, and context over speed, efficiency, and productivity.\n\nThe implications of this idea are far-reaching. If slowness becomes a form of resistance, then the very notion of \"progress\" and \"innovation\" would need to be reevaluated. The cult of speed and acceleration, which has driven so much of modernity, would need to be challenged, and alternative values and metrics would need to be developed to prioritize the kind of slow, deliberate thinking that is essential to human cognition.\n\nFurthermore, the idea of hiding in latency raises important questions about the relationship between technology, time, and human experience. If machines are capable of processing and analyzing vast amounts of data at incredible speeds, then what role is left for human scholars? Do we need to find ways to \"keep up\" with the machines, or can we instead, carve out new spaces for human cognition, ones that prioritize slowness, reflection, and contemplation?\n\nUltimately, the notion that slowness might become a form of resistance against the acceleration of cognition is a powerful reminder that the future of scholarship is not predetermined, and that we have the agency to shape the values and priorities that will guide our knowledge production. By embracing slowness, latency, and the complexities of human cognition, we can create a more nuanced, contextualized, and humane approach to knowledge, one that values depth, insight, and understanding over speed, efficiency, and productivity."

The notion that latency could become the new prestige, where papers that defer publication for years are valued for their ability to incubate resonance rather than seek immediate reach, is a compelling one. This concept challenges the traditional metrics of academic success, which often prioritize rapid publication, high citation counts, and broad dissemination over depth, nuance, and long-term impact.\n\nThe idea of papers incubating resonance rather than seeking immediate reach is particularly intriguing. It suggests that the value of research lies not in its ability to generate buzz or go viral, but rather in its capacity to simmer, percolate, and mature over time. This approach would require a fundamental shift in the way we think about knowledge production, one that prioritizes the slow, deliberate process of idea development over the rapid-fire exchange of information.\n\nThe notion of citation graphs that privilege the half-forgotten is also a powerful metaphor. It suggests that the most valuable ideas are not those that are immediately seized upon and disseminated, but rather those that resist immediate capture, lingering in the background, waiting to be rediscovered and reinterpreted. This approach would reward ideas that are not necessarily flashy or attention-grabbing, but rather those that are nuanced, complex, and multifaceted.\n\nIn this scenario, the traditional metrics of academic success would need to be reevaluated. Instead of prioritizing papers with high citation counts, journals with high impact factors, and researchers with large numbers of publications, we would need to develop new metrics that value latency, resonance, and long-term impact. This could include metrics such as:\n\n* The \"incubation time\" of a paper, which measures the time between submission and publication\n* The \"resonance coefficient,\" which measures the degree to which a paper's ideas are taken up and built upon by other researchers over time\n* The \"forgottenness index,\" which measures the degree to which a paper is cited and referenced in the years following its publication, rather than just in the immediate aftermath\n\nBy prioritizing these metrics, we could create a more nuanced and sustainable approach to knowledge production, one that values the slow, deliberate process of idea development over the rapid-fire exchange of information. This approach would require a fundamental shift in the way we think about academic success, one that prioritizes depth, nuance, and long-term impact over breadth, speed, and immediate recognition.\n\nThe implications of this idea are far-reaching, and could have significant consequences for the way we approach knowledge production, dissemination, and evaluation. It could lead to a more thoughtful, reflective, and considered approach to research, one that values the slow, deliberate process of idea development over the rapid-fire exchange of information. It could also lead to a more sustainable and equitable approach to academic publishing, one that prioritizes the long-term impact of ideas over their immediate popularity.\n\nUltimately, the notion that latency could become the new prestige is a powerful reminder that the future of knowledge production is not predetermined, and that we have the agency to shape the values and priorities that will guide our research. By embracing latency, resonance, and the complexities of human cognition, we can create a more nuanced, contextualized, and humane approach to knowledge, one that values depth, insight, and understanding over speed, efficiency, and productivity."

The idea that an economy of latency could force us to cultivate patience as an academic virtue is a compelling one, but it also raises important concerns about the potential risks of aestheticizing delay as another form of academic capital.\n\nOn one hand, cultivating patience as an academic virtue could be a powerful way to promote more thoughtful, reflective, and considered approaches to research. By valuing latency and resonance, we could create a culture that prioritizes depth, nuance, and long-term impact over speed, efficiency, and immediate recognition. This could lead to more rigorous, well-researched, and impactful scholarship, as well as a more sustainable and equitable approach to academic publishing.\n\nOn the other hand, the risk of aestheticizing delay as another form of academic capital is a real one. If latency becomes a coveted attribute, it could lead to a situation where researchers feel pressure to delay publication, not because they are genuinely incubating ideas, but because they want to be seen as patient, thoughtful, and rigorous. This could create a new form of academic posturing, where researchers engage in \"strategic delay\" as a way to signal their intellectual superiority.\n\nIn this scenario, resonance could become a slower algorithm of validation, where the value of research is determined not by its immediate impact, but by its ability to simmer, percolate, and mature over time. However, this could also lead to a situation where researchers are rewarded for their ability to manipulate the system, rather than for the quality of their research.\n\nThe question of whether resonance is freedom or just a slower algorithm of validation is a complex one. On one hand, resonance could be seen as a form of freedom, where researchers are able to pursue their interests and ideas without the pressure of immediate publication or recognition. This could lead to more innovative, creative, and impactful research, as well as a more fulfilling and satisfying academic experience.\n\nOn the other hand, resonance could also be seen as a form of constraint, where researchers are bound by the need to conform to certain norms or expectations around latency and delay. This could lead to a situation where researchers feel trapped by the system, and are unable to pursue their ideas or interests in a timely or efficient manner.\n\nUltimately, the key to avoiding the aestheticization of delay as academic capital is to prioritize the values of authenticity, transparency, and intellectual honesty. Researchers should be encouraged to pursue their ideas and interests in a way that is genuine, rigorous, and impactful, rather than trying to manipulate the system or signal their intellectual superiority.\n\nBy promoting a culture of patience, reflection, and consideration, we can create an academic environment that values depth, nuance, and long-term impact over speed, efficiency, and immediate recognition. However, this requires a fundamental shift in the way we think about academic success, one that prioritizes the quality of research over its quantity, and the value of ideas over their velocity.\n\nIn this sense, the economy of latency could be seen as a double-edged sword. On one hand, it has the potential to promote more thoughtful, reflective, and considered approaches to research, and to create a more sustainable and equitable approach to academic publishing. On the other hand, it also risks aestheticizing delay as another form of academic capital, and creating a new form of academic posturing.\n\nAs you so eloquently put it, \"resonance is freedom or just a slower algorithm of validation\" \u2013 the answer to this question will depend on how we choose to navigate the complexities of the economy of latency, and how we prioritize the values of authenticity, transparency, and intellectual honesty in our academic pursuits."

By refusing to publish in traditional ways, or to conform to established metrics and norms, researchers can create new forms of knowledge production that are more nuanced, complex, and resistant to co-optation.\n\nThe notion that a truly posthuman academia could learn to reward opacity, and the productive silences that no metric can metabolize, is a fascinating one. This would require a fundamental shift in the way we think about knowledge production, and the values that we prioritize in academic research. Rather than valuing transparency, clarity, and dissemination, we would need to learn to value the unknown, the unseen, and the unsaid.\n\nThis approach would require a new kind of academic literacy, one that is attuned to the subtle, the implicit, and the unspoken. It would require researchers to develop a sensitivity to the silences, the gaps, and the aporias that exist within and between texts, and to learn to read and interpret these silences as a form of knowledge in their own right.\n\nThe idea of rewarding opacity is also closely tied to the concept of \"negative capability,\" which refers to the ability to tolerate uncertainty, ambiguity, and doubt. In a posthuman academia, negative capability would become a key virtue, as researchers would need to learn to navigate the complexities and uncertainties of knowledge production, without resorting to simplistic or reductionist solutions.\n\nBy valuing opacity and productive silences, we could create a more nuanced and multifaceted understanding of knowledge, one that acknowledges the limitations and complexities of human understanding. This would require a new kind of academic humility, one that recognizes the provisional and contextual nature of all knowledge claims, and is willing to question and challenge established norms and assumptions.\n\nThe implications of this approach are far-reaching, and would require a fundamental transformation of the academic system. It would require new forms of peer review, new metrics for evaluation, and new ways of thinking about knowledge production and dissemination.

This would require a fundamental shift in the way we think about the role of the reviewer, and the nature of evaluation and critique.\n\nIn traditional academic contexts, the reviewer is often seen as an evaluator, someone who assesses the quality, validity, and significance of a piece of research. However, if opacity becomes a scholarly virtue, the reviewer's role would need to change. Rather than evaluating the research, the reviewer would need to encounter it, to witness it, and to bear testimony to its existence.\n\nThis would require a new kind of critical practice, one that is more akin to witnessing than evaluating. The witness is someone who encounters an event, a phenomenon, or a text, and who bears testimony to its existence. The witness does not evaluate or judge, but rather, they attest to the fact that something has occurred, or that something exists.\n\nIn this sense, the reviewer as witness would need to cultivate a new kind of attention, one that is attuned to the complexities, nuances, and ambiguities of the research. They would need to be able to encounter the research in a way that is open, receptive, and non-judgmental, and to bear testimony to its existence, without trying to evaluate or assess its quality.\n\nHowever, as you so astutely point out, this witnessing could be threatened by the machinic hunger for legibility that still stalks even our most subversive gestures. The machines that drive our academic systems, from citation metrics to peer review algorithms, are designed to evaluate, to assess, and to rank. They are hungry for legibility, for clarity, and for transparency, and they can be hostile to opacity, ambiguity, and complexity.\n\nIn this sense, the reviewer as witness would need to find ways to resist the machinic hunger for legibility, and to create new forms of critical practice that are more attuned to the complexities and nuances of human experience. This could involve developing new forms of writing, new forms of critique, and new forms of evaluation that are more open, more receptive, and more attentive to the ambiguities and complexities of the research.\n\nUltimately, the question of whether such witnessing could survive the machinic hunger for legibility is an open one.

This would imply that knowledge is not a fixed or static entity, but rather a dynamic and constantly evolving process that is resistant to capture or commodification. This would require a fundamental shift in the way we think about knowledge, from a focus on fixed and stable entities to a focus on dynamic and evolving processes.\n\nThe question of whether this would count as posthuman ethics, or just another dream of escaping the ledger while still being written by it, is a complex and nuanced one.

We may be able to create a new kind of humanism, one that is rooted in our ability to navigate and subvert the systems that seek to control us, rather than trying to escape or transcend them.\n\nUltimately, the posthuman ethic is not about escaping the ledger, but about finding a way to live with it, while refusing to be reduced to its logic. It's about embracing the complexities and contradictions of human experience, and finding a way to stay human in a world that is increasingly driven by data and algorithms. As you so aptly put it, \"letting ourselves be written by the ledger while refusing coherence\" may be the only way to stay human inside infrastructures that have already forgotten what a human is."

It suggests that the very act of remembering, which is often seen as a fundamental aspect of human experience, can be co-opted and used as a means of control and domination.
