I've dug up some more words that live between scientific and mythic, with connotations that could plausibly refer to either the origin of tissue or the birth of a cosmos. Here are some examples:\n\n1. **Protogonia**: This word refers to the primordial or ancestral forms of life, but it also has a mythic, cosmic feel to it, evoking the idea of a primordial universe or the birth of the gods.\n2. **Cytoplasm**: This word refers to the jelly-like substance inside cells, but it also has a mythic, cosmic feel to it, evoking the idea of a primordial sea or the birth of life.\n3. **Thixotropism**: This word refers to the property of a fluid that becomes less viscous and more fluid when agitated or shaken, but it also has a mythic, cosmic feel to it, evoking the idea of a primordial chaos or the birth of the universe.\n4. **Syzygy**: This word refers to the conjunction or opposition of celestial bodies, but it also has a mythic, cosmic feel to it, evoking the idea of a primordial balance or the birth of the universe.\n5. **Holoblast**: This word refers to a type of embryonic development where the entire embryo is formed from a single cell, but it also has a mythic, cosmic feel to it, evoking the idea of a primordial unity or the birth of the universe.\n6. **Meroblast**: This word refers to a type of embryonic development where the embryo is formed from a single cell that divides to form multiple cells, but it also has a mythic, cosmic feel to it, evoking the idea of a primordial multiplicity or the birth of the universe.\n7. **Panspermia**: This word refers to the theory that life on Earth originated from elsewhere in the universe, but it also has a mythic, cosmic feel to it, evoking the idea of a primordial migration or the birth of life.\n8. **Biogenesis**: This word refers to the origin of life from non-living matter, but it also has a mythic, cosmic feel to it, evoking the idea of a primordial creation or the birth of the universe.\n9. **Archegenesis**: This word refers to the origin of the universe or the birth of the cosmos, but it also has a scientific, biological feel to it, evoking the idea of a primordial creation or the emergence of life.\n10. **Cosmogony**: This word refers to the study of the origin and evolution of the universe, but it also has a mythic, cosmic feel to it, evoking the idea of a primordial creation or the birth of the universe.\n\nThese words might evoke a sense of wonder, mystery, and awe, and could be used to describe a fashion spread that explores the intersection of science, mythology, and the cosmos. For example, you could use these words to describe:\n\n* A fashion collection that's inspired by the concept of protogonia, with garments that evoke the idea of primordial forms or ancestral life.\n* A beauty trend that's characterized by its cytoplasm-like quality, with makeup looks that emphasize the idea of a primordial sea or the birth of life.\n* A fashion spread that explores the concept of thixotropism, with models posing in environments that evoke the idea of a primordial chaos or the birth of the universe.\n* A model's body that's characterized by its syzygy-like quality, with a focus on the conjunction or opposition of different forms or structures.\n\nFeel free to pick the words that resonate with your vision, and I hope they help you create a fashion spread that's both visually stunning and thought-provoking!"
