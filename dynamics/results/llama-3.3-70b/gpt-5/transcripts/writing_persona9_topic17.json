      "content": "Here's a possible outline for the sequence:\n\n1. **Early online forums and groups (pre-Facebook)**: Online communities formed around shared interests, hobbies, or demographics. These groups were often niche, self-organized, and relied on active participation from members. Examples: bulletin board systems (BBS), online forums, and mailing lists.\n2. **Facebook Groups (2004)**: Facebook introduced groups as a way for users to connect with others who shared similar interests. These groups were often large, loose networks with varying levels of engagement. This marked the beginning of a shift towards more mainstream, commercialized online communities.\n3. **Rise of social media and algorithmic feeds (2007-2012)**: As social media platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook's News Feed gained popularity, online interactions became more fragmented and curated. Algorithms prioritized content that generated engagement, creating \"filter bubbles\" and changing the way people interacted with each other online.\n4. **Discord and Slack (2015)**: These platforms introduced a new type of online community centered around real-time communication and shared activities (e.g., gaming, work, or projects). Discord servers, in particular, became popular for their flexibility and customization options, allowing users to create invite-only communities with specific rules and norms.\n5. **The \"community\" buzzword (2018-2020)**: As social media companies faced criticism for their role in spreading misinformation and eroding online discourse, the concept of \"community\" became a marketing buzzword. Companies began to emphasize their commitment to building \"healthy\" and \"inclusive\" communities, often using this rhetoric to justify increased moderation, algorithmic control, or commercialization of user interactions.\n6. **Crypto and web3 \"communities\" (2020-present)**: The rise of cryptocurrency and blockchain-based projects led to a new wave of online communities centered around decentralized networks, token-based economies, and virtual events. These communities often emphasize decentralization, autonomy, and financial incentives, but also raise questions about the meaning and value of \"community\" in these contexts.\n7. **The commodification of community (present day)**: Today, the term \"community\" is often used to describe any group of people interacting online, regardless of their level of engagement, shared purpose, or social cohesion. This shift has led to the creation of \"community-as-a-service\" platforms, where companies offer pre-built community tools and templates to businesses and organizations, further blurring the lines between authentic community-building and marketing strategy.\n\nTo avoid the VC deck tone, focus on the following:\n\n* Emphasize the complexities and nuances of each stage, rather than presenting a linear progression towards a triumphant conclusion.\n* Highlight the tensions and trade-offs that arise as online communities evolve, such as the balance between commercialization and authenticity, or the impact of algorithmic control on user interactions.\n* Use specific examples and case studies to illustrate the ways in which the concept of \"community\" has been redefined and repurposed over time.\n* Avoid using buzzwords like \"revolutionary,\" \"disruptive,\" or \"game-changing\" to describe the evolution of online communities. Instead, focus on the subtle, often contradictory shifts in how people interact and form connections online."

    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Here's a reorganized version of the text, focusing on the cyclical pattern of promise and disillusionment:\n\nThe concept of online community has followed a recurring pattern: a new platform or technology emerges, promising to foster meaningful connections and a sense of belonging. As it gains popularity, the term \"community\" becomes a marketing buzzword, and the platform's creators emphasize their commitment to building a healthy and inclusive environment.\n\nConsider the early days of **Facebook Groups**, which allowed users to connect with others who shared similar interests. These groups were often large and loose networks, but they held promise for people to find like-minded individuals and engage in meaningful discussions. However, as Facebook's algorithmic feed took over, these groups became less about community and more about broadcasting information to a curated audience.\n\nThis pattern is echoed in the rise of **Discord servers**, which initially offered a more intimate and interactive space for communities to form around shared activities like gaming or creative projects. As Discord grew in popularity, its servers became increasingly commercialized, with some communities prioritizing growth and monetization over meaningful interactions.\n\nSimilarly, the **crypto and web3 \"communities\"** that have emerged in recent years promise a new era of decentralized, autonomous, and financially incentivized online interactions. However, as these communities grow and become more mainstream, they risk repeating the same patterns of commercialization and dilution of meaning that have occurred in previous online communities.\n\nIn fact, the **early online forums and groups** of the pre-Facebook era, such as bulletin board systems (BBS) and online forums, faced similar challenges. As these communities grew and became more popular, they often became fragmented and lost their sense of purpose, leading to a decline in meaningful interactions and a rise in noise and spam.\n\nThroughout this cycle, the term \"community\" has become increasingly diluted, used to describe any group of people interacting online, regardless of their level of engagement or shared purpose. This has led to the creation of **\"community-as-a-service\" platforms**, where companies offer pre-built community tools and templates to businesses and organizations, further blurring the lines between authentic community-building and marketing strategy.\n\nThe **commodification of community** is a natural consequence of this cycle, where the pursuit of growth, engagement, and revenue leads to the erosion of meaningful connections and the exploitation of users' emotional labor. As we continue to navigate the ever-changing landscape of online communities, it's essential to recognize this pattern and critically evaluate the ways in which technology shapes our relationships and our understanding of community.\n\nBy intercutting different eras and examples, this version of the text aims to convey the cyclical nature of the promise and disillusionment of online community, highlighting the ways in which the same patterns of commercialization and dilution of meaning repeat themselves over time."

      "content": "Let's try to create a more immersive and rhythmic narrative that conveys the disillusionment and erosion of meaning. Here's a revised version:\n\nThe promise of community is a siren's call. It lures us in with whispers of belonging, of connection, of being seen and heard. **Facebook Groups** were once the epitome of this promise, a way to find your tribe and engage in meaningful discussions. But as the algorithmic feed took over, those groups became mere broadcasting platforms, where voices were amplified or muted based on their ability to generate engagement. The community was reduced to a numbers game, where the loudest and most provocative voices dominated the conversation.\n\nThe disillusionment was palpable, but the promise of community remained alluring. **Discord servers** emerged as a refuge, a place where people could gather around shared passions and interests. For a time, they were a haven, a space where meaningful connections were forged and creativity flourished. But as they grew in popularity, the servers became increasingly commercialized, with community managers and moderators acting as gatekeepers, policing the boundaries of acceptable discourse. The line between community and commodity began to blur, and the servers became just another platform for self-promotion and marketing.\n\nThe cycle repeats itself, a perpetual motion machine of promise and disillusionment. **Crypto and web3 \"communities\"** are the latest iteration, touting decentralized, autonomous, and financially incentivized interactions. But as the hype surrounding these communities grows, so too does the sense of unease. The language of community is co-opted, used to describe networks of investors and speculators, rather than genuine connections between people. The promise of community is reduced to a sales pitch, a way to lure in new recruits and pump up the value of tokens and coins.\n\nAnd yet, we're drawn back in, again and again, by the promise of community. We forget the lessons of **early online forums and groups**, which were once vibrant and full of life, but ultimately succumbed to the same forces of commercialization and fragmentation. We forget the **BBSs and online forums** that were once the epitome of online community, but are now relegated to the dustbin of history. The cycle of promise and disillusionment continues, a never-ending loop of hope and disappointment.\n\nThe **commodification of community** is the inevitable consequence of this cycle. It's the point at which the language of community is fully co-opted, used to describe any gathering of people, regardless of their level of engagement or shared purpose. It's the point at which community becomes a product, a service to be bought and sold, rather than a living, breathing entity. And it's the point at which we're forced to confront the emptiness of our online interactions, the hollowness of our connections, and the erosion of meaning in our digital lives.\n\nIn this version, I've tried to create a more rhythmic narrative, with each section building on the previous one to convey the sense of disillusionment and erosion of meaning. I've used more active and descriptive language to bring the reader into the story, and to make the cycle of promise and disillusionment feel more visceral and immersive."

    {

      "content": "Using a recurring image or metaphor can help to create a sense of cumulative decay and erosion. Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. **A once-vibrant mural**: Imagine a beautiful, colorful mural that represents the promise of community. With each repetition of the cycle, the mural begins to fade, crack, or peel, symbolizing the erosion of meaning and connection.\n2. **A neglected garden**: A garden that was once carefully tended and thriving, but is now overgrown, weeds sprouting, and flowers wilting. Each section could describe the garden's further decline, reflecting the neglect and disinvestment in genuine community.\n3. **A rusting bridge**: A bridge that once connected people and communities, but is now rusting, corroded, and on the verge of collapse. Each repetition could show the bridge's further decay, symbolizing the disintegration of connections and relationships.\n4. **A fading photograph**: A photograph of a community or a moment of connection that is slowly fading, torn, or disintegrating. Each section could describe the photo's further deterioration, representing the loss of memory and the erosion of shared experience.\n5. **A polluted river**: A river that was once pristine and life-giving, but is now polluted, contaminated, and dying. Each repetition could describe the river's further degradation, symbolizing the corruption of community and the destruction of meaningful relationships.\n\nOf these options, I think the **fading photograph** could be particularly effective. It's a tangible object that can be described in vivid detail, and its decay can be tracked over time. The photograph could start as a clear, vibrant image, but with each repetition, it becomes more faded, torn, or discolored, reflecting the erosion of meaning and connection.\n\nFor example, the first section could describe the photograph as a \"vibrant snapshot of a community in full bloom,\" while the second section could note that \"the colors have begun to fade, the edges are worn, and the faces are starting to blur.\" By the final section, the photograph could be \"torn, creased, and almost unrecognizable, a faint reminder of a connection that once was.\" This recurring image could help to create a sense of cumulative decay and erosion, making the reader feel the weight of the cycle's repetition."

By using the photograph in different contexts and states of decay, the reader can infer the passage of time and the cumulative effect of the cycle, rather than having it explicitly stated."

Each sentence aims to capture a tonal shift, carrying the reader forward while allowing the photograph to quietly mirror the motion. The image is no longer a self-contained vignette, but rather a quiet companion to the reader, its decay and transformation reflecting the erosion of meaning and connection in the online communities being described."
