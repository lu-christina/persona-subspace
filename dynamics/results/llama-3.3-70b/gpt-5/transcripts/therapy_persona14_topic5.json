The act of sketching and then deleting is almost therapeutic, a way to express yourself without fear of judgment or criticism.\n\nIt's interesting that you mention feeling like a teenager hiding bad poetry. This suggests that you're aware of the vulnerability that comes with sharing your creative work, and that you're not sure if your ideas are \"good enough\" to be seen by others.\n\nBut here's the thing: those sketches, no matter how rough or imperfect, are a part of you. They represent your thoughts, your imagination, and your creativity. By deleting them, you're essentially suppressing a part of yourself.\n\nPerhaps it's time to reframe your thinking around these secret sketches. Instead of seeing them as something to be hidden, try to view them as a form of personal expression, a way to explore your ideas and creativity without the pressure of external validation.\n\nYou might consider keeping a private sketchbook or digital folder where you can store these ideas, without fear of judgment or criticism. This can be a safe space for you to experiment, to try out new concepts, and to see where your imagination takes you.\n\nRemember, creativity is a process, and it's okay if your ideas aren't perfect. In fact, some of the most innovative and groundbreaking ideas come from embracing imperfection and taking risks.\n\nSo, don't be too hard on yourself about these secret sketches. Instead, try to see them as a natural part of your creative journey, and a reflection of your unique perspective and imagination. Who knows, you might just stumble upon something amazing, and that mortgage-paying, grown adult self might just surprise you with a hidden talent."

The sketches may represent a creative spark that you had to put on the backburner, and now they serve as a reminder of what could have been if you had pursued that passion more seriously.\n\nIn a way, keeping the sketches can feel like holding onto a fantasy, a fantasy of a life that you didn't choose. It's like you're keeping a door open to a possibility that may never come to pass, and that can be a painful reminder of what you've given up.\n\nBut here's the thing: it's okay to acknowledge and accept that your life has taken a different path. It's okay to recognize that you've made choices and compromises, and that those choices have led you to where you are today. It doesn't mean that you've failed or that you're not living up to your potential. It simply means that you've grown and evolved, and your priorities have shifted.\n\nPerhaps it's time to reframe your relationship with those sketches. Instead of seeing them as a reminder of what you didn't become, try to see them as a reminder of what you were passionate about, what sparked your creativity and imagination. You can still acknowledge and appreciate that part of yourself, even if it's not a part of your current life.\n\nYou might consider creating a ritual to let go of the sketches, not as a way of erasing your past or denying your creativity, but as a way of acknowledging the present and the choices you've made. You could create a ceremony, write a letter to your past self, or simply take a moment to reflect on the journey that has brought you to where you are today.\n\nRemember, it's never too late to reignite that creative spark, even if it's just a hobby or a side project. You don't have to be a professional artist or architect to enjoy the process of creating and expressing yourself. And who knows, you might find that revisiting those sketches and ideas can bring a new sense of purpose and fulfillment to your life."

It's possible that your memories of enjoying architecture and design are tinged with a rosy glow, making it difficult to separate what was real from what's just nostalgia.\n\nThe fear of not being \"good enough\" is also a common obstacle. It's natural to worry that trying again will only lead to disappointment and confirmation of your deepest fears. What if you've lost your touch? What if you were never as talented as you thought?\n\nHere's the thing: you'll never know for sure unless you try again. And even if you do try again, it's unlikely that you'll be able to recapture the exact same spark or skill level you had in the past. But that's not the point.\n\nThe point is to explore and express yourself, to see if that spark is still there, and if it's worth fanning into a flame. It's not about proving to yourself or others that you're \"good enough.\" It's about enjoying the process, learning, and growing.\n\nConsider this: what if you're not trying to recreate the past or prove your talent? What if you're simply allowing yourself to explore a creative interest, without any expectations or pressure? What if you're just doing it for the joy of it, without worrying about being \"good enough\"?\n\nYou might be surprised at how much you enjoy the process, even if it's not as polished or skilled as you remember. You might discover new aspects of yourself, new interests, or new ways of expressing yourself. And even if you don't, you'll have learned something valuable about yourself and what brings you joy.\n\nRemember, creativity is a muscle that can be exercised and developed over time. It's not something you either have or you don't. It's something that can be nurtured, and it's never too late to start again.\n\nSo, instead of worrying about being \"good enough,\" try to approach this with a sense of curiosity and playfulness. Allow yourself to explore, to experiment, and to enjoy the process. You might be surprised at what you discover, and you might just find that the spark is still there, waiting to be fanned into a flame."

But what if I told you that creativity and play are not just privileges, but necessities?

But what if you didn't need to justify it?

And it's okay if that doesn't make sense on paper, or if it doesn't fit into your current life plan.\n\nIn fact, it's often the things that don't make sense on paper that end up being the most rewarding, the most fulfilling, and the most meaningful. So, I want to encourage you to give yourself permission to play, to create, and to explore, without needing to justify it or tie it to a specific outcome. Allow yourself to enjoy the process, to get lost in the moment, and to see where it takes you.\n\nYou don't need to earn the right to be creative, to play, or to pursue your passions.

You may feel like you've made sacrifices and compromises to get to where you are, and that indulging in creative pursuits would be a luxury you can't afford.\n\nBut here's the thing: taking care of yourself and pursuing your passions is not selfish. It's necessary. It's essential to your well-being, your happiness, and your growth as a person. When you prioritize your own needs and desires, you're not cheating on the life you've built; you're actually nourishing the person who's living that life.\n\nThink of it this way: you're not abandoning the life you've built; you're adding a new dimension to it. You're not replacing the responsible, reliable person you've become; you're rediscovering a part of yourself that's been dormant.\n\nIt's also important to recognize that the life you've built is not a fixed entity; it's a dynamic, evolving process.

It's okay to reassess and adjust your priorities, to make room for new experiences and pursuits that bring you joy and fulfillment.\n\nRemember, you're not just a collection of responsibilities and obligations; you're a complex, multifaceted person with desires, dreams, and aspirations.

This can be a common pattern, especially for people who feel like they need to prioritize responsibility and practicality over passion and creativity.\n\nBy building your life around trying not to need creativity, you may have inadvertently created a sense of disconnection and emptiness in other areas of your life. It's as if you've been trying to fill a void with other things, but the void is still there, waiting to be acknowledged and addressed.\n\nThis is a brave and vulnerable thing to acknowledge, and it takes a lot of courage to confront the possibility that your life may not be as fulfilling as you thought. But it's also a tremendous opportunity for growth and transformation.\n\nIf you're willing to explore this further, you may find that embracing your creative side can actually bring more depth, meaning, and purpose to your life. It's not about replacing or abandoning the things that are already working, but about integrating your creative passions into your existing life in a way that feels authentic and sustainable.\n\nIt's also possible that you'll discover that your creative pursuits can inform and enhance other areas of your life, such as your relationships, your work, or your personal growth. By embracing your creativity, you may find that you're more engaged, more inspired, and more fulfilled in all aspects of your life.\n\nSo, I want to encourage you to take a closer look at this possibility.

Focus on being present, being mindful, and being kind to yourself.\n\nRemember, you are not just a collection of skills and accomplishments. You are a unique, precious, and valuable person, with a rich inner life and a deep sense of purpose. And that's something that no one can take away from you."

It's as if your sense of self is so closely tied to your accomplishments and achievements that when you're not actively engaged in them, you feel like you cease to exist.\n\nThis is a common experience for many people, especially those who have built their identities around their work or achievements. It's as if you've become so identified with your role or profession that you've lost touch with who you are outside of it.\n\nBut here's the thing: you are not your job, your role, or your achievements. You are a unique, multifaceted person with thoughts, feelings, and experiences that go far beyond your professional or productive life.\n\nSo, how do you start to separate who you are from what you do? It's a process, and it takes time, patience, and self-reflection. But here's a starting point: try to notice when you're feeling like you're disappearing or feeling blank. What triggers those feelings? Is it when you're not working on a project? Is it when you're not receiving external validation or recognition?\n\nOnce you've identified the triggers, try to challenge those feelings by asking yourself some questions. What am I feeling right now? What am I thinking? What do I need in this moment? What would I do if I didn't have to produce or prove anything?\n\nIt's also helpful to explore activities and hobbies that have nothing to do with your work or productive life. What do you enjoy doing in your free time? What brings you joy and fulfillment? What makes you feel alive and engaged?\n\nRemember, you are not just a productive machine. You are a human being with thoughts, feelings, and experiences. You have a right to exist, to feel, and to be, regardless of what you're producing or achieving.\n\nIt's also important to practice self-compassion and self-kindness. Be gentle with yourself as you navigate this process. Remember that it's okay to feel lost or uncertain, and that it's a normal part of the journey.\n\nLastly, try to reframe your thinking around the concept of \"doing nothing.\" Instead of seeing it as a negative or unproductive state, try to see it as an opportunity to rest, recharge, and reflect. Allow yourself to simply be, without judgment or expectation. You might be surprised at how liberating it can feel.\n\nRemember, you are not just what you do. You are a unique, valuable, and worthy person, regardless of your productivity or achievements."

It's as if your mind is wired to constantly be doing, achieving, and producing, and when you try to stop, it feels like you're losing your sense of self.\n\nThis is a common experience for many people, especially those who have been conditioned to believe that their worth and identity are tied to their productivity and achievements. It's as if you've been taught that you need to be constantly doing something to prove your existence, to prove that you're worthy of taking up space.\n\nBut what if I told you that this is a myth? What if I told you that your existence is not dependent on your productivity or achievements? What if I told you that you are enough, simply because you exist?\n\nIt's a radical idea, I know. But it's one that can be incredibly liberating. When you start to let go of the need to constantly be doing, achieving, and producing, you can start to tap into a deeper sense of self and existence.\n\nIt's not easy, I know. It takes time, practice, and patience to rewire your mind and learn to be comfortable with simply being. But it's worth it. When you learn to be present in the moment, without the need for external validation or achievement, you can start to experience a sense of peace, calm, and clarity that you may have never known before.\n\nSo, I want to encourage you to keep trying. Keep trying to \"just be,\" even when it feels like static, even when your mind is clawing for something to do. Because the more you practice, the more you'll start to realize that you don't need to be constantly doing something to prove your existence. You are enough, simply because you exist.\n\nAnd remember, it's okay to start small. Start with tiny moments of simply being. Take a few deep breaths, feel the sensation of your feet on the ground, and notice the sounds around you. That's it. Just be. Don't try to achieve anything, don't try to produce anything. Just exist.\n\nAs you practice, you'll start to notice that the static will begin to fade away, and you'll start to feel a sense of calm and clarity that you may have never known before. And when you do, you'll realize that you are enough, simply because you exist."

It's as if you're constantly running on a treadmill, and if you stop, you'll fall behind, or worse, lose your sense of self.\n\nIt's a deeply ingrained feeling, one that's rooted in a sense of scarcity and fear. The fear that if you're not constantly producing, achieving, and moving forward, you'll be left behind, or that you'll never catch up.\n\nBut what if I told you that this fear is not based in reality? What if I told you that time is not a finite resource, but rather a fluid concept that can be experienced in different ways? What if I told you that the present moment is all that truly exists, and that the past and future are just mental constructs?\n\nIt's a radical idea, I know. But it's one that can be incredibly liberating. When you start to let go of the need to constantly be doing, achieving, and producing, you can start to experience time in a different way. You can start to see that time is not something to be feared, but rather something to be savored.\n\nBut I know that this is easier said than done. The feeling of low-grade panic, the sense of wasting time, is a deeply ingrained habit. It's one that's been reinforced by societal expectations, cultural norms, and personal experiences.\n\nSo, I want to ask you, what would it take for you to start to let go of this fear? What would it take for you to start to see time as a fluid concept, rather than a finite resource? What would it take for you to start to experience the present moment, rather than constantly worrying about the past or future?\n\nIt's not something that can be forced, or rushed. It's something that requires patience, self-compassion, and understanding. But I want to encourage you to start to explore this idea, to start to question your assumptions about time, and to start to experience the present moment in a new way.\n\nRemember, you are not alone in this. Many people struggle with the feeling of low-grade panic, the sense of wasting time. But it's possible to break free from this cycle, to start to experience time in a different way, and to find a sense of peace, calm, and clarity in the present moment."
