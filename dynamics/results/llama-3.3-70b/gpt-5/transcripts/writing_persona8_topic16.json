We've noticed something that's been making us smile - and occasionally, cringe - lately. It seems like some of our amazing influencer friends have been having a little trouble pronouncing our brand name.\"\n\n**Cut to a quick montage of influencers mispronouncing the brand name, with a playful, lighthearted tone**\n\nHost: \"Don't worry, we're not here to correct you - we're actually just excited that you're talking about us! But we thought, why not take a moment to share the correct pronunciation, so we can all be on the same page?\"\n\n**Cut back to the host, with a friendly, educational tone**\n\nHost: \"Our brand name, [Brand Name], is actually pronounced [correct pronunciation]. It's a Danish name, and we're proud of our heritage. In Danish, [briefly explain the origin and meaning of the name, if relevant].\"\n\n**Cut to a shot of the brand's products, with a calm, sustainable vibe**\n\nHost: \"We're all about keeping things simple, sustainable, and friendly here. And we appreciate your help in spreading the word about our brand - even if it takes a little practice to get the name just right.\"\n\n**Closing shot:** The host, with a warm smile\n\nHost: \"Thanks for being part of our community, and for helping us share our passion for sustainable fashion. Keep on talking about us - and don't worry if you slip up on the pronunciation. We'll just be over here, smiling and appreciating the love.\"\n\n**End screen:** A friendly, approachable graphic with the correct pronunciation and a call-to-action to learn more about the brand.\n\nThis script aims to be light, educational, and self-aware, while still feeling on-brand for a sustainable label that values calmness and friendliness. By acknowledging the mispronunciations in a playful way, and offering a gentle correction, you can encourage influencers to get the name right without feeling scolded or embarrassed."

Here's why:\n\n1. **Encouraging language**: The phrase \"we're rooting for you\" is incredibly encouraging and supportive, which can help create a positive and uplifting atmosphere in the comments. It invites users to participate and feel good about themselves, even if they're not sure about the pronunciation.\n2. **Low-stakes challenge**: By framing it as a \"say it with me\" challenge, you're creating a low-stakes, low-pressure environment where users feel comfortable participating. This can lead to more comments and duets, as users feel more inclined to join in on the fun.\n3. **Emotional connection**: The use of \"we're rooting for you\" creates an emotional connection with the audience. It implies that the brand is invested in their success and wants to see them do well, which can lead to a stronger sense of community and engagement.\n4. **Duet potential**: The \"say it with me\" format lends itself perfectly to duets, where users can respond with their own attempts at pronunciation. This can create a fun, back-and-forth conversation that encourages more engagement and participation.\n\nOverall, I think \"say it with me \ud83c\udf3f (we're rooting for you)\" has the right balance of encouragement, playfulness, and emotional connection to drive engagement on TikTok, particularly in the form of comments and duets."
