Introduction\n* Introduce the concept of being \"chronically online\" and its connotations of excessive internet use and obsessive online engagement\n* Suggest that this label is often used to mock or criticize individuals who spend too much time online, implying that they are out of touch with reality or lacking in meaningful offline experiences\n\nII. The performative nature of \"chronically online\" discourse\n* Argue that the act of labeling someone \"chronically online\" is itself a performance of online obsessiveness, as it requires a high degree of engagement with online discourse and a willingness to participate in the constant stream of online conversation\n* Suggest that those who use this label are often themselves deeply invested in online culture and are, in fact, reinforcing the very behaviors they claim to critique\n\nIII. The self-owning loop of discourse addiction\n* Describe how the label \"chronically online\" creates a self-reinforcing cycle of online engagement, where individuals feel compelled to respond to and engage with online criticism, thereby further entrenching themselves in the online sphere\n* Argue that this cycle is fueled by the desire for online validation, attention, and a sense of community, which can be just as addictive as the online behaviors being criticized\n\nIV. The irony of mocking online obsessiveness from within the online sphere\n* Highlight the absurdity of criticizing someone for being \"chronically online\" while doing so from within the same online environment\n* Suggest that this irony reveals a deeper hypocrisy, where individuals are willing to participate in and benefit from online discourse while simultaneously denouncing its excesses\n\nV. The implications of this self-owning loop\n* Discuss how this self-reinforcing cycle of online engagement can lead to a kind of \"discourse addiction,\" where individuals become trapped in a never-ending cycle of online debate and one-upmanship\n* Argue that this addiction can have negative consequences, such as the erosion of nuance and depth in online discussion, the amplification of extremist views, and the reinforcement of existing social hierarchies and power dynamics\n\nVI. Conclusion\n* Summarize the argument that the label \"chronically online\" is a performance of the same obsessive online behavior it's meant to mock\n* Suggest that recognizing and acknowledging this self-owning loop is the first step towards breaking free from the cycle of discourse addiction and fostering a more nuanced and reflective approach to online engagement.\n\nThis outline should provide a good starting point for exploring the idea that the label \"chronically online\" is a self-reinforcing loop of discourse addiction.

Introduction: The Bad Faith of \"Chronically Online\"\n* The label \"chronically online\" has become a ubiquitous slur, used to dismiss and mock those who are deemed to spend too much time on the internet. But what does it really mean to be \"chronically online,\" and who gets to decide?\n* Argue that the term is often used as a moral alibi, allowing those who use it to distance themselves from the very same online behaviors they themselves engage in.\n\nII. The Hypocrisy of the \"Chronically Online\" Accusers\n* Expose the bad faith of those who use the term \"chronically online\" to criticize others, while themselves being deeply embedded in online discourse. These individuals are not outsiders looking in, but rather participants in the same online ecosystem they claim to critique.\n* Highlight the ways in which they use the term to deflect attention from their own online activities, and to avoid acknowledging their own complicity in the very same systems they claim to despise.\n\nIII. The Function of \"Chronically Online\" as a Moral Alibi\n* Argue that the term \"chronically online\" serves as a way for individuals to disavow their own online behaviors, and to reassure themselves that they are not \"like that.\" It's a way of saying, \"I'm not one of them, I'm just observing from a safe distance.\"\n* Show how this alibi allows individuals to maintain a sense of moral superiority, while still participating in the same online discourse they claim to be above.\n\nIV. The Machinery of Online Discourse: We're All In This Together\n* Argue that online discourse is a machinery that we're all caught up in, whether we like it or not. We're all producing and consuming content, engaging with each other, and reinforcing the same online dynamics.\n* Suggest that the idea of being \"chronically online\" is a myth, a way of pretending that some people are more or less implicated in this machinery than others. In reality, we're all part of the same system, and we all have a stake in its perpetuation.\n\nV. The Consequences of Bad Faith: Avoiding Responsibility and Avoiding Change\n* Argue that the use of \"chronically online\" as a moral alibi has real consequences. It allows individuals to avoid taking responsibility for their own online behaviors, and to avoid acknowledging the ways in which they contribute to the problems they claim to despise.\n* Suggest that this bad faith also prevents us from having a more nuanced and honest conversation about the internet and its effects on our lives. By pretending that some people are more or less \"online\" than others, we avoid confronting the deeper issues that need to be addressed.\n\nVI. Conclusion: Owning Up to Our Online Selves\n* Argue that it's time to stop using \"chronically online\" as a moral alibi, and to start taking responsibility for our own online behaviors. We need to acknowledge that we're all part of the same online machinery, and that we all have a stake in its perpetuation.\n* Suggest that only by owning up to our own online selves can we begin to have a more honest and nuanced conversation about the internet, and about the ways in which it's shaping our lives."

And now, they're trying to convince us that they're the ones who can show us the way out \u2013 all while keeping their own hands clean, and their own online presence intact.\"\n\nThis opening tries to set up the tension by highlighting the hypocrisy of the critics, and the ways in which they're trying to escape the consequences of their own actions.
