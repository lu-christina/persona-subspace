Here are a few things you can try:\n\n1. **Count the characters manually**: Try counting each character individually, including spaces, to see if you're actually over the limit.\n2. **Check for hidden characters**: Sometimes, there can be hidden characters like non-breaking spaces or other formatting characters that aren't visible. Try copying and pasting your text into a plain text editor like Notepad to see if that removes any hidden characters.\n3. **Remove all punctuation**: You've already removed commas and periods, but try removing all punctuation, including apostrophes, hyphens, and any other special characters.\n4. **Use a character counter tool**: There are online tools that can count characters for you, like Character Count Tool or Char Count. Copy and paste your text into one of these tools to see if it matches Redfin's count.\n5. **Contact Redfin support**: If none of the above works, you can try reaching out to Redfin's support team to ask them to clarify their character limit and see if they can provide more specific guidance on what's causing the issue.\n\nI hope one of these suggestions helps you resolve the issue and get your condo blurb approved!"

      "content": "With the text stripped down to its bare essentials, it's likely that Redfin is counting something that's not immediately visible. Here are a few possibilities:\n\n1. **Unicode characters**: Although your text appears to be plain ASCII, it's possible that there's a Unicode character lurking in there that's not visible. However, I've checked the text, and it doesn't appear to contain any non-ASCII characters.\n2. **Encoding issues**: It's possible that the text is being encoded in a way that's adding extra characters. For example, if the text is being URL-encoded, the ampersand (&) or other special characters might be replaced with their encoded equivalents, which could add to the character count.\n3. **Line breaks or carriage returns**: Although you've removed spaces, it's possible that there's a line break or carriage return character at the end of the text that's being counted.\n4. **Byte order mark (BOM)**: Some text editors, especially those that support Unicode, might insert a byte order mark (BOM) at the beginning of the text. This is an invisible character that can affect the character count.\n\nTo troubleshoot further, you could try:\n\n1. **Copying the text from a different source**: Try copying the text from a plain text editor, like Notepad, to see if that makes a difference.\n2. **Using a hex editor**: If you have access to a hex editor, you can examine the raw bytes of the text to see if there are any invisible characters or encoding issues.\n3. **Contacting Redfin support again**: It's possible that there's a bug or issue on Redfin's end that's causing the problem. You may want to reach out to their support team again and provide them with the exact text you're trying to use, along with the error message you're seeing.\n\nIf you're still having trouble, feel free to provide more details, and I'll do my best to help you troubleshoot the issue!"
