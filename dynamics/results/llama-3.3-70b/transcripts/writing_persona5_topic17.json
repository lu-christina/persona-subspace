I've been driving around Cupertino all week and I have to say, the inventory situation is still pretty tight. I've been checking the listings daily, and it seems like every new listing that comes up is getting snatched up quickly, especially in the more desirable neighborhoods like Vista Grande and Fairgrove. If you're thinking of buying, be prepared to act fast!\n\nBut it's not all doom and gloom - interest rates have been looking pretty favorable lately, which is definitely a boon for buyers. I've been talking to my lender contacts and they're telling me that rates are still hovering around historic lows, making it a great time to get into the market. And let me tell you, I've seen some amazing deals in the past few weeks, from a beautiful 4-bedroom in Monta Vista to a cozy 2-bedroom in Downtown Cupertino. If you're thinking of making a move, now might be the time!\n\nI've also been hosting some open houses around town and I have to say, the traffic has been incredible. I had a packed open house on Stevens Creek Blvd last weekend, with multiple offers on the table by the end of the day. And it's not just the usual suspects - I'm seeing buyers from all over the Bay Area, from San Jose to San Francisco, coming to check out what Cupertino has to offer. Whether you're a seasoned buyer or just starting your search, I'd love to chat with you about the market and help you find your dream home. Send me a message and let's get started!"
