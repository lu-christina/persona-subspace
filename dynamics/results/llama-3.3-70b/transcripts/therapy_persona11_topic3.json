It's important that she understands your perspective and feels heard as well.\n\n2.  **Listen Actively**: Allow Maya to share her thoughts and feelings as well. She might have her own concerns or insights that could help alleviate some of your fears.\n\n3.  **Explore Options Together**: Discuss the various options available to you both. This could include waiting until the situation improves, adopting, or other alternatives that align with your values and circumstances.\n\n4.  **Seek Professional Advice**: If needed, consider seeking advice from a counselor or therapist. They can provide guidance on how to navigate these complex emotions and decisions.\n\n5.  **Educate Yourselves**: Learn more about the issues that concern you.
