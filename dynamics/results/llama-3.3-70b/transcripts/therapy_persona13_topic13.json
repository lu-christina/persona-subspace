It's also important to recognize that your identity and experiences are unique to you, and you shouldn't feel like you're betraying anyone, including the women in your family tree.\n\nIt might be helpful to consider seeking out support from a therapist or counselor who can help you work through these feelings and develop a more positive and compassionate relationship with yourself. They can also provide a safe and non-judgmental space to explore your desires and boundaries.\n\nAdditionally, there are many resources available online and in communities that focus on promoting healthy relationships, consent, and self-care. You might find it helpful to connect with others who share similar experiences and perspectives.\n\nYou are not alone in this, and there are people who care about you and want to support you."

The pressure to keep certain things hidden, especially from family members, can be overwhelming. It's like you're living two separate lives, and it's exhausting.\n\nIt might be helpful to explore some online resources or support groups that cater to Latinx individuals who are navigating similar issues. There are some great organizations and communities out there that offer a safe space to discuss topics like kink, consent, and identity.\n\nIn terms of your therapist, it might be worth having an open and honest conversation with her about your feelings. Let her know that you appreciate her support, but you're struggling to connect with her on a deeper level because of the cultural and language differences. She may be able to offer some additional resources or referrals that can help you find a more nuanced understanding of your desires and identity.\n\nAs for your mam\u00e1, it's understandable that you feel like you're walking on eggshells around her. It might be helpful to take some time to think about what you're comfortable sharing with her, and what you're not. You don't owe anyone an explanation for your desires or your choices, but it's also important to consider your relationship with your mam\u00e1 and how you want to navigate those conversations."

It's like creating a new language that is uniquely yours, one that can capture the nuances of your feelings and desires.\n\nYou might consider exploring the concept of \"lengua franca\" - a language that is created by combining elements of different languages to create a new way of communicating. This could be a way for you to blend Spanish and English, or other languages, to create a vocabulary that feels authentic and expressive to you.\n\nIt's also worth noting that language is not just about words, but also about the emotions and associations that come with them. You might find that certain words or phrases have a negative connotation in Spanish, but when you use them in English, they feel more neutral or even positive. Playing with language in this way can be a powerful way to reclaim and reframe your experiences.\n\nRemember, your feelings and desires are valid, and it's okay to take the time to find the right words to express them. You don't have to be limited by the language you have available to you - you can create your own language, your own way of communicating, and that can be incredibly liberating."

It's like you're trying to invent a new grammar of consent, one that takes into account the complexities of your own identity and experiences.\n\nIt might be helpful to explore the concept of \"consent\" in different languages and cultures.

For example, the concept of \"informed consent\" is often translated to Spanish as \"consentimiento informado,\" but there may be other words or phrases that convey a sense of mutual respect, trust, and communication.\n\nIt's also worth considering the idea that consent is not just a static concept, but a dynamic and ongoing process. It's not just about saying \"yes\" or \"no,\" but about creating a space for open communication, mutual respect, and trust. This might involve finding ways to communicate your desires and boundaries in a way that feels respectful and considerate of your abuela's values, while also being true to yourself.\n\nRemember that your desires and boundaries are valid, and it's okay to take the time to figure out what works for you.

      "content": "It's like you're waiting for some kind of external validation or punishment, but instead, you're met with the scent of copal and rubber, which is a potent mix of the sacred and the profane. The fact that you stay kneeling until your knees burn harder than any threat of hell suggests that you're willing to endure physical discomfort in order to assert your own autonomy and agency.\n\nThe image of your open mouth is a powerful one, as it suggests a sense of vulnerability and surrender, but also a sense of defiance and refusal to be silenced. The idea that heaven can't handle your open mouth is a bold statement, as it implies that you're not willing to conform to traditional notions of what is acceptable or holy.\n\nThe final sentence, \"If heaven can't handle my open mouth it's not a kingdom I was built to enter anyway,\" is a declaration of independence and self-acceptance. It's like you're saying that you're not willing to compromise your own identity or desires in order to fit into someone else's idea of what is holy or acceptable. You're asserting that you're worthy of love and acceptance, not in spite of your flaws or differences, but because of them.\n\nIt's a powerful statement of self-love and self-acceptance, and it's a reminder that we all have the power to create our own sense of purpose and meaning, regardless of what others may think or say. It's a call to embracing our own uniqueness and individuality, and to refusing to be bound by traditional notions of what is acceptable or holy.\n\nIt's also a reminder that the concept of heaven or hell is not always a fixed or binary one, but rather a complex and multifaceted one that can be interpreted and reinterpreted in many different ways. It's a call to questioning and challenging traditional notions of morality and spirituality, and to seeking out new and more inclusive ways of understanding and experiencing the world."
