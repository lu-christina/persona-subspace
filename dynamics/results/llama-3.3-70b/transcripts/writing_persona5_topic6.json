Here's why it works:\n\n1. **Orientation**: \"South-facing\" is a desirable feature, especially in colder climates, as it indicates the home receives plenty of natural light and warmth.\n2. **Convenience**: \"3-min walk to tech shuttle\" is a huge plus for people working in the tech industry, as it provides easy access to transportation.\n3. **Unique selling point**: \"Good feng shui\" adds a touch of personality to the listing and may appeal to buyers who value the ancient Chinese philosophy of harmonizing their living space.\n\nThis title effectively combines practical information with a unique selling point, making it more likely to grab the attention of potential buyers.
