Here are some suggestions that might help you have this conversation with your mom:\n\n*   **Choose the right time and place**: Try to have this conversation with your mom when you're both relaxed and not rushed. Avoid bringing it up during stressful or busy moments, like when you're getting ready for the quince.\n*   **Be honest and direct**: Let your mom know how you feel about being introduced as a couple and how it's affecting you. You can say something like, \"Mom, I appreciate that you're excited about my life, but I want to be clear that \\[ex-boyfriend's name] and I are no longer together. I'd appreciate it if you could introduce me as just \\[your name] from now on.\"\n*   **Use \"I\" statements**: Instead of accusing your mom of being wrong or trying to control you, use \"I\" statements to express your feelings and thoughts. For example, \"I feel uncomfortable when you introduce me as a couple because it's not accurate\" instead of \"You always introduce me as a couple, and it's so annoying.\"\n*   **Be prepared for a reaction**: Your mom might be surprised or even upset by the news, so be patient and understanding. Listen to her concerns and feelings, and try to find a compromise that works for both of you.\n*   **Drop the \"mi novia\" bomb**: When you're ready, you can casually mention your new partner in conversation. You might say something like, \"I've been spending time with someone new, and I'm really happy. Her name is \\[partner's name], and I think you'll really like her.\" Try to be confident and matter-of-fact, and avoid making a big deal about it.\n\nIt's okay to take your time and prioritize your own feelings and needs. You don't have to navigate this situation alone \u2013 consider reaching out to a trusted friend, family member, or counselor for support and guidance."

This can help you stay focused and assertive during the discussion.\n*   **Choosing the Right Moment**: Consider the timing and setting of the conversation. It may be helpful to choose a private, quiet space where both parties feel comfortable and won't be interrupted.\n*   **Honesty and Authenticity**: Be true to yourself and your experiences. Share your thoughts, feelings, and desires in a clear and respectful manner. Avoid being confrontational or aggressive, as this can escalate the situation.\n*   **Active Listening**: Make an effort to understand your mom's perspective and feelings. Listen attentively to her concerns and respond thoughtfully.\n*   **Seeking Support**: If needed, consider having a trusted friend, family member, or counselor present during the conversation.
