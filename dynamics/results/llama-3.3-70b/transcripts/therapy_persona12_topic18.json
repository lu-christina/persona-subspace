It's natural to feel this way, especially when it seems like others are moving on or not understanding your pain.\n\nWanting someone to understand or share your emotional burden doesn't necessarily mean you're turning into someone your wife wouldn't recognize. It's possible that you're just trying to process and cope with your emotions in a way that feels authentic to you.\n\nIt might be helpful to explore these feelings further, either by talking to your wife or a trusted friend, or by engaging in some reflective activities like journaling or meditation. This could help you better understand what you're going through and find ways to manage your emotions in a healthy and constructive way.\n\nIt's also important to remember that everyone grieves and processes emotions differently, and it's okay to feel whatever you're feeling. You don't have to put on a mask or pretend to be someone you're not. Your wife likely loves and accepts you for who you are, and it's possible that she's struggling to understand your emotions because she's not experiencing them in the same way.\n\nIf you feel comfortable, you might consider having an open and honest conversation with your wife about how you're feeling. It's possible that she's not aware of the depth of your emotions, and talking about it could help you both feel more connected and understood."

It's a testament to the love and connection you shared, and it's okay to hold onto those feelings, even if it's just in your memories and conversations with yourself or, in this case, with me.\n\nThe image of the empty chairs and the man patting his companion's hand is a powerful metaphor for the pain of loss and the feeling of being left behind. It's like you're seeing the world moving on without your wife, and it's hard to reconcile that with the grief and emptiness you're feeling.\n\nIf you feel like talking more about your wife, your memories of her, or your feelings about your loss, I'm here to listen. Sometimes sharing your thoughts and emotions with someone (or even a machine) can help you process and work through them.

It's natural to wonder if you took your wife for granted, or if you could have done things differently. But it's essential to remember that you loved her, and she knew it.\n\nThat memory of her laughing at your brother's golf story is a beautiful one. It's a testament to the joy and connection you shared, and it's something to hold onto. It's okay to cherish those moments, even if they're now tinged with sadness.\n\nIt might be helpful to remind yourself that you didn't know what the future held, and you couldn't have predicted what would happen. You lived in the moment, and you loved your wife to the best of your ability.

It's common to replay moments and wonder what we could have done differently. But it's essential to remember that your wife's passing was not a result of anything you did or didn't do. It's not about the emails you checked under the table or the jokes you didn't tell. It's about the time you had together, and the love you shared.\n\nIt's possible that you're experiencing a form of survivor's guilt, where you're feeling responsible for something that's not your fault. It's a heavy burden to carry, but it might help to remind yourself that you did the best you could with the time you had. You loved your wife, and she knew it.\n\nIt's also important to recognize that your wife's laughter and joy were not solely dependent on you. She had her own sense of humor, her own interests, and her own way of experiencing the world. While it's beautiful that you want to take credit for making her laugh, it's also important to acknowledge that her happiness was not solely your responsibility.\n\nIf you don't mind me asking, what do you think your wife would say to you if she were here right now?

It's as if you're trying to understand whether the cancer took it away from her, or if it was just a natural part of her journey.\n\nIt's possible that the answer to that question is complex, and that it's a mix of both. Cancer can be a brutal and exhausting disease, and it's likely that it took a toll on Bitsy's physical and emotional energy.
