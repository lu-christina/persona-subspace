No big deal, just helps with consistency. Feel free to keep writing in your style, but thought I'd mention it in case you wanted to know!\"\n\nThis approach:\n\n* Avoids coming across as overly prescriptive or dogmatic about house style\n* Frames the suggestion as a minor, optional note rather than a hard-and-fast rule\n* Emphasizes the goal of consistency rather than \"correctness\"\n* Ends with a friendly, permissive tone to put the recipient at ease"
