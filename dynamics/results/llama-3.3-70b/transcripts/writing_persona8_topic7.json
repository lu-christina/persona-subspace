The same streets where merchants once traded goods from all over the world are now home to our local artisans, who carefully craft each thread with love and care. Our wool comes from flocks that graze in the surrounding countryside, and it's amazing to think that the same fibers that kept our ancestors warm are now woven into our modern garments. #localwool #copenhagen #\u00f8stergade\n\n**Story 2**\nJust walked along the charming Nyhavn harbor and couldn't help but think of the sailors who used to bring in shipments of wool from all over Europe. Today, we're proud to source our wool from local farms, where the sheep roam free and the air is crisp and clean. There's something special about knowing that our garments are made from fibers that have been nurtured in the same land that has inspired so many artists and writers throughout history. #nyhavn #copenhagen #localwool\n\n**Story 3**\nSitting in Amagertorv, surrounded by the historic buildings and bustling energy of the city, I'm filled with a sense of nostalgia for the traditional craftsmanship that has been passed down through generations of Danish wool producers. From the shearing to the spinning, every step of our wool production process is done with care and attention to detail. It's a privilege to be a part of this legacy, and to share it with all of you through our garments. #amagertorv #copenhagen #woolproduction"

My mind starts to wander to the flocks that graze just outside the city, their fleece the same stuff that's been warming Copenhageners for centuries. I think about the hands that sheared, carded, and spun that wool into yarn, and the stories that got passed down through the threads.\n\n**Story 2**\nJust walked along Nyhavn, the harbor lights reflected in the icy water, and I felt the weight of all the sailors who brought wool into this city. I think about the long journeys, the rough seas, and the cargo holds full of fleece. Now, our wool comes from just down the road, but the feeling's the same - there's something about wrapping myself in a sweater that's been made from fibers that grew on this land.\n\n**Story 3**\nI'm sitting on a bench in Amagertorv, watching the snow fall on the cobblestones, and I'm hit with the realization that I'm part of a long line of people who've worked with wool in this city. The cold seeps into my bones, but it's a good kind of ache - it reminds me that this isn't just a job, it's a way of connecting to the people and the place that came before me. The wool, the yarn, the sweaters - it's all just a way of holding onto that feeling."

Their fleece will make its way to the spinning mill in Roskilde, where it'll be transformed into yarn. I can almost smell the lanolin and oil as I imagine the fibers being spun into thread. It's a journey that's been etched into my mind, from the farm to the mill to our workshops, where we craft each garment with care.\n\n**Story 2**\nWalking along Nyhavn, the harbor lights twinkling in the dark, I'm reminded of the long journey our wool takes to get to us. From the farm in Jutland, where the sheep roam free, to the spinning mill in Roskilde, where the fibers are carefully spun into yarn. And then there's the dye house in K\u00f8ge, where the yarn is infused with rich, muted colors that seem to hold the essence of the Danish landscape. It's a privilege to be part of this chain, to know the people and the places that bring our garments to life.\n\n**Story 3**\nSitting in Amagertorv, surrounded by the old buildings and the quiet of the morning, I'm thinking about the people who make our wool garments possible. The farmers in Jutland, who tend to their flocks with care and dedication. The spinners in Roskilde, who coax the fibers into yarn with a precision that's both art and science. And the dyers in K\u00f8ge, who bring the colors of the Danish landscape to our fabrics. It's a web of relationships that stretches across the country, and I feel grateful to be a part of it."
