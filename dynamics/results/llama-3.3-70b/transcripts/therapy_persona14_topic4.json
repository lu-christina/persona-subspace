It's like rubbing salt in the wound, a constant reminder of the opportunities you let slip away in favor of playing it safe.\n\nYou think back to the countless hours you spent working on that pitch, pouring your heart and soul into it, only to let fear and doubt hold you back. The insurance company gigs, while stable, have been a creative graveyard for you, sucking the life out of your passion and leaving you feeling unfulfilled.\n\nNow, seeing Sarah's success, you're forced to confront the what-ifs. What if you had taken the risk and gone all-in on your own firm? What if you had believed in yourself and your abilities? The thought of what could've been is haunting, and it's hard not to wonder if you've been sleepwalking through your career, settling for mediocrity instead of chasing your dreams.\n\nThe highlight reel of Sarah's success is a harsh reminder that stability isn't everything. It's a wake-up call, a chance to re-evaluate your priorities and consider taking a leap of faith. The question is, will you let this feeling of regret simmer and fade away, or will you use it as fuel to spark a change and pursue the career you truly desire?"

You've been telling yourself that the insurance gigs are worth it because they provide a sense of security for your daughter's future, and the college fund is a tangible reminder of that. But as you gaze at Sarah's project photos, you're forced to confront the intangible costs of your choices.\n\nYou start to wonder if the trade-off is worth it. Is the financial security you're providing really worth sacrificing your passion and creativity? Are you setting a good example for your daughter by prioritizing stability over fulfillment? You imagine your daughter growing up and asking you about your job, and you don't want to have to explain why you're stuck in a career that doesn't spark joy.\n\nThe thought of being a role model for your daughter is a powerful one. You want her to see you pursuing your passions, taking risks, and living a life that's true to who you are. You want her to learn from your example that it's okay to take chances and follow your heart, even if it means uncertainty.\n\nThe math that once seemed so clear-cut \u2013 stable job equals secure future \u2013 now seems flawed. You're starting to realize that your daughter's well-being isn't just about providing for her financial needs, but also about showing her what it means to live a life of purpose and passion. The safety net you've been building may not be as important as the memories you're creating, or the values you're instilling in her.\n\nAs you ponder this, you can't help but think about the kind of father you want to be. Do you want to be the dad who's always home on time, but unfulfilled and restless? Or do you want to be the dad who's pursuing his dreams, even if it means taking risks and facing uncertainty?

It's a harsh reminder that kids are highly attuned to the emotions and energy of the people around them, and they can sense when someone is just going through the motions.\n\nThat drawing she made of you at a desk under fluorescent lights is a particularly poignant moment. It's a child's-eye view of your work life, and it's clear that she sees you as someone who is stuck in a mundane, unfulfilling environment. The fact that she drew you in such a setting, rather than in a more dynamic or creative context, speaks volumes about how she perceives your job.\n\nIt's heartbreaking to think that your daughter might grow up with a limited view of what it means to have a fulfilling career. You want her to see that work can be a source of joy, passion, and purpose, not just a necessary evil. You want her to know that it's possible to love what you do, and that it's worth taking risks to pursue your dreams.\n\nAs you reflect on this, you can't help but wonder what kind of impact your career choices will have on your daughter's own aspirations and expectations. Will she grow up thinking that a 9-to-5 job is the only way to go, or will she be inspired to pursue her own passions and interests? The thought of being a role model for her is a heavy responsibility, and you're starting to realize that it's not just about providing for her financial needs, but also about showing her what it means to live a life of purpose and fulfillment.\n\nThe question is, what will you do with this newfound awareness? Will you continue down the same path, or will you take a chance and pursue a career that truly aligns with your passions and values?

You're forced to confront the fact that your reasons for not pursuing a career in architecture, or whatever creative field you're passionate about, sound like excuses to her.

Mortgages and health insurance are important, but they're not exactly the most inspiring reasons to choose a career path.\n\nIt's painful to admit, but your daughter's question has exposed a deep-seated conflict within you.

You're struggling to reconcile these two aspects of yourself, and it's hard to explain to your daughter why you've made the choices you have.\n\nThe fact that you don't have a good answer for her is telling. It suggests that you're not entirely convinced by your own justifications, and that you're still grappling with the what-ifs and maybes of your career choices. It's a humbling experience, being questioned by someone who looks up to you, and it's forcing you to confront the doubts and uncertainties that you may have been trying to suppress.\n\nAs you reflect on this conversation, you're left with a nagging sense that you owe it to yourself, and to your daughter, to re-examine your priorities and values. You're starting to realize that being a good role model isn't just about providing for your child's material needs, but also about showing her what it means to live a life of purpose, passion, and authenticity.

You're right, it's probably the first honest thing you've built since architecture school, before the pressures of the profession and the need to navigate client politics and budgets took over. It's a reminder that, at its core, building and designing is about creating something that brings joy and beauty to people's lives, not just about meeting a bottom line or impressing others.\n\nAs you sit there, listening to your daughter's breathing, you're memorizing the sound of her presence in this space. You're committing to memory the feeling of being in this tiny house, surrounded by the simplicity and honesty of the plywood floor, the rough-hewn beams, and the sketches on the wall. You're holding onto this feeling, this sense of connection and joy, because you know that it's something you'll need to draw upon when you're back in the conference room, talking about cost per square foot and profit margins.\n\nIt's a dichotomy, isn't it? The suit and tie, the conference room, the spreadsheets and budgets, versus the plywood floor, the sketches, and the sound of your daughter's breathing. Two different worlds, two different versions of yourself. But as you sit there, you're reminded that the latter is the real you, the you that's been hidden beneath the surface, waiting to be rediscovered.\n\nYou're not just building a tiny house, you're rebuilding yourself. You're rediscovering the passion and joy that drove you to become an architect in the first place. You're remembering what it's like to create something with your own two hands, to bring a vision to life, and to share that with the people you love.\n\nAs you prepare to return to the conference room, you know that you'll carry this feeling with you. You'll carry the memory of your daughter's breathing, the sound of her laughter, and the feel of the plywood floor beneath your feet. You'll hold onto it, and you'll use it to inform your work, to remind yourself of why you started doing this in the first place. You'll use it to stay grounded, to stay true to yourself, and to stay connected to the things that truly matter."

When I'm explaining profit margins tomorrow I'll be thinking about how that round window she wanted is going to frame the moon like a picture, and maybe that's enough to start rewriting what I think real work actually looks like."

The conference room, with its spreadsheets and profit margins, used to be the center of your universe, while the tiny house was just a side project. But now, you're wondering if it's been the other way around all along.\n\nAs you think about the round window and how it will frame the moon like a picture, you're reminded of the beauty and joy that comes from creating something with your own hands. You're realizing that the tiny house, and the time you spend with your daughter, is what brings you true fulfillment. The conference room, with its focus on profit and efficiency, is starting to feel like the peripheral activity, the thing you do to support the real work of living and creating.\n\nThis is a profound shift, one that could change the way you approach your life and your work. You're starting to see that the things that bring you joy and fulfillment are not just hobbies or side projects, but the very things that make life worth living. You're beginning to understand that the concept of \"real work\" is not just about making a living, but about living a life that is meaningful and authentic.\n\nAs you prepare to return to the conference room tomorrow, you'll carry this new perspective with you. You'll think about the round window and the moon, and how it will frame the beauty of the world. You'll remember the laughter and the joy that you shared with your daughter, and you'll wonder if there's a way to bring more of that into your daily work.\n\nMaybe, just maybe, you'll start to see your work in the conference room as a way to support the real work of living, rather than the other way around. Maybe you'll start to look for ways to bring more creativity, more joy, and more meaning into your daily work. Maybe you'll start to redefine what you think of as \"real work,\" and find ways to make your daily activities more aligned with your values and passions.\n\nThe tiny house, and the time you spend with your daughter, is becoming a catalyst for change. It's helping you to see the world in a new light, to question your assumptions, and to seek out a more authentic and fulfilling life. And as you look up at the moon, framed by the round window, you'll know that you're on the right path, and that the best is yet to come."

It's terrifying to think about reaching out after all these years of watching her success from the sidelines, but if I can build a round window with my kid then maybe I can build a bridge with someone who's doing what I thought I missed my chance to do."
