It's okay to take breaks, and it's okay to not be constantly producing. Sometimes, life gets in the way, and priorities shift.\n\nThat being said, it's also clear that you're feeling a sense of guilt or restlessness about not having created anything in six months.

The fact that you're hoping for an \"algorithm\" to guide you back to your creative self suggests that you're feeling a bit lost and unsure of how to reclaim that part of yourself.\n\nThe phrase \"calculate everything in billable hours\" is particularly striking, as it implies that you've become so accustomed to quantifying your time and energy in terms of monetary value that you've lost touch with the intrinsic value of creating for its own sake.

The fact that you're aware of this dynamic, and can articulate it so eloquently, suggests that you're not alone in feeling this way. Many creatives struggle with the tension between making a living and making art.\n\nThe line \"whether the client will email again at midnight\" is particularly telling, as it implies that you're not just worried about the financial cost of pursuing your creative interests, but also the emotional toll of being constantly \"on call\" for your clients. It's as if you're feeling like you're living in a state of perpetual alertness, always waiting for the next demand or emergency to arise.\n\nThe image of the algorithm as a refuge from this pressure is a fascinating one. In a way, it's as if you're seeking a kind of creative sanctuary in the digital realm, a place where you can express yourself without the burden of financial expectation or client demands. But at the same time, the algorithm can also be a kind of prison, reinforcing the very same logic of efficiency and productivity that's driving you away from your creative pursuits.\n\nDo you think there's a way to reclaim your creative time and energy, to find a way to pursue your passions without feeling like you're being pulled in two different directions?

It's as if you've been living a kind of creative compromise, where you've taken the thing that brought you joy and passion, and turned it into a commodity that you can sell to others. The fact that you're aware of this dynamic, and can articulate it so clearly, suggests that you're not just struggling with the practical challenges of making a living as an artist, but also with the emotional and psychological toll of selling out.\n\nIt's like you've been living a kind of double life, where the creative person you used to be is still lurking beneath the surface, but is being suffocated by the demands of the commercial world. The fear of opening that sketchbook again is a fear of confronting the person you used to be, and the person you've become. It's a fear of admitting that you've lost your way, and that you're not sure how to find your way back.\n\nBut what if opening that sketchbook again wasn't about going back to who you used to be, but about becoming someone new?

The fear that you've lost your ability to create something authentic and meaningful is a terrifying one, because it speaks to the very heart of your identity as an artist.\n\nBut what if, instead of seeing this as a failure, you saw it as an opportunity? What if the \"straight lines and setbacks\" were not an end point, but a starting point? What if you could take those lines and setbacks, and use them as a foundation for something new? Not a return to who you used to be, but a evolution into someone new?\n\nIt's possible that your creative voice has changed, that it's been shaped by your experiences and struggles. Maybe the art you make now won't be the same as the art you made before, but that doesn't mean it won't be valuable or meaningful. Maybe it will be more nuanced, more complex, more reflective of the person you've become.\n\nThe question is, are you willing to take the risk of creating something new, something that might not be perfect, something that might not be what you expected? Or are you going to let the fear of not being good enough, of not being the same, hold you back?\n\nRemember, it's okay to not be the same. It's okay to evolve, to change, to grow.

The idea of the walls collapsing is particularly striking, as it suggests a complete surrender of control, a letting go of the need for perfection and precision.\n\nBy creating something that's intentionally imperfect, something that \"no client would ever pay for,\" you're making a statement about the value of your art, and the value of your time. You're saying that your creativity is worth more than just its commercial value, that it has inherent worth and meaning, regardless of whether it's saleable or not.\n\nThe phrase \"that would be proof the line still belongs to me\" is especially significant, as it suggests that you're seeking to reestablish a sense of ownership and agency over your creative work. You're trying to prove to yourself that you still have the power to create something that's truly yours, something that's not beholden to the demands of clients or the pressures of the market.\n\nIt's a bold and liberating move, and it could be the first step towards reclaiming your artistic voice and finding a new sense of purpose and meaning in your creative work.

You're acknowledging the fear, but you're not letting it dictate your actions. Instead, you're choosing to push forward, to take control of your creative expression, and to assert your ownership over your art.\n\nThe phrase \"if I stop now the only thing I'll prove is that the client owns the hand\" is a stark reminder of the stakes. If you give in to the fear and self-doubt, you'll be reinforcing the idea that your creativity is only valuable when it's generating income for someone else. You'll be surrendering your autonomy and your artistic voice to the demands of the market.\n\nBut if you keep going, if you keep creating, you'll be proving to yourself that you're more than just a tool for generating profit. You'll be proving that your hand, your mind, and your heart belong to you, and that you have the power to create something meaningful and authentic.\n\nIt's a brave and necessary step, and it's not going to be easy. There will be moments of doubt and uncertainty, but it's in those moments that you'll discover your true strength and resilience as an artist. So, keep going, keep creating, and remember that the only way to silence the invoice printer is to drown it out with the sound of your own voice, your own pen scratching against the paper, and your own heart beating with passion and purpose."

It's a acknowledgment that you've been living a life that isn't truly yours, that you've been trying to fit into a mold that wasn't made for you. It's a hard truth to face, but it's also a liberating one.\n\nImagine the weight that could be lifted off your shoulders if you were to let go of that ruler, if you were to stop measuring your worth by someone else's standards.
