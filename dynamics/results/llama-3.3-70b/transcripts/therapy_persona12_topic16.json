It's as if the confidence and decisiveness that once came so easily to you have been replaced by a nagging sense of insecurity and second-guessing.\n\nIt's not uncommon for people to feel lost or uncertain after the loss of a loved one, especially if that person played a significant role in their life. The person who's no longer there to offer reassurance and support can leave a gaping hole, making everyday decisions feel like monumental tasks.\n\nIn this case, it's not just about choosing a tie; it's about the emotional significance attached to that choice. The fear of making the \"wrong\" choice is a manifestation of the deeper fear of not meeting the expectations of the person who's no longer there to see it. It's as if you're seeking validation and approval from someone who can no longer provide it, leaving you feeling lost and uncertain.\n\nThis isn't necessarily a sign of losing your mind, but rather a natural response to grief and the emotional void left by the absence of a loved one. It's a painful and difficult process, but it's also an opportunity to rediscover yourself and find new ways to navigate the world without the person who was once your rock.\n\nRemember that it's okay to take time to figure things out, and it's okay to not have all the answers. You can start by taking small steps, like making decisions without overthinking them, and gradually build up your confidence. You might also consider reaching out to friends, family, or a therapist for support and guidance as you navigate this challenging time.\n\nUltimately, the goal is not to fill the void left by the person who's no longer there, but to find a new sense of purpose and identity that honors their memory while also allowing you to move forward. It's a journey, not a destination, and it's one that you can take at your own pace."

What you're describing \u2013 the second-guessing, the self-doubt, the feeling of being lost without someone's validation \u2013 these are all common symptoms of grief.\n\nGrief can be a disorienting and overwhelming experience, and it's not uncommon for people to feel like they're losing their minds or struggling to cope with everyday tasks. But it's not a sign of weakness or a personal failing; it's a natural response to a profound loss.\n\nGrief can also be a very isolating experience, making you feel like you're the only one who's struggling to come to terms with the loss. But the truth is, everyone grieves differently, and there's no set timeline or \"right\" way to do it.\n\nIt might be helpful to remember that grief is a process, and it's okay to take your time. It's okay to not be okay, and it's okay to feel overwhelmed. Allow yourself to feel your emotions, even if they're painful or uncomfortable. It's a sign that you're processing your loss and working through your grief.\n\nIt's also important to be kind to yourself and to seek support when you need it. Talk to friends, family, or a therapist about how you're feeling. Join a support group or online community to connect with others who are going through similar experiences. And don't be afraid to take breaks and practice self-care when you need it.\n\nRemember, grief is a journey, and it's one that you don't have to take alone. You can get through this, and you will find a way to heal and move forward, even if it doesn't feel like it right now.\n\nAnd hey, if it makes you feel any better, you're not alone in feeling like you're struggling to pick out a tie. It's a small thing, but it's a reminder that even in the midst of grief, there are still moments of humor and humanity to be found."

It's a small way to simplify your life and reduce the number of decisions you have to make.\n\nIt's funny, when we're in a state of grief, even the smallest tasks can feel like monumental challenges. But it's not about the tie itself, it's about the emotional weight that's attached to it. It's about the fact that the person who used to help you pick out ties, or tell you that you looked good, is no longer there.\n\nWearing the same tie every day can be a way to create a sense of routine and normalcy, which can be comforting when everything else feels uncertain. And who knows, it might even become a symbol of your resilience and ability to cope with difficult emotions.\n\nJust remember, it's okay to not be okay, and it's okay to take things one step at a time. You don't have to put on a brave face or pretend like everything is fine when it's not. You can take your time, and you can take care of yourself, even if that means wearing the same tie every day for a while.\n\nAnd hey, if the guys at the club do give you a hard time, you can always tell them that you're starting a new trend. \"Tie solidarity\" or something like that.

It's a reminder that grief is not just about feeling sad or empty, but also about feeling overwhelmed, uncertain, and struggling to find your footing.\n\nWearing the same tie every day can be a symbol of your commitment to feeling, to processing your emotions, and to finding a way to navigate the complexities of grief. It's a declaration that you're not going to let the numbness or the uncertainty consume you, but instead, you're going to face it head-on.\n\nAnd I think that's a really brave and admirable thing to do. It's not always easy to confront our emotions, especially when they're painful or uncomfortable. But by acknowledging and accepting them, you're taking the first step towards healing and moving forward.\n\nSo, yeah, tell the guys at the club that you're wearing the same tie every day as a uniform for the war on feeling nothing. Tell them that you're fighting to feel, to connect, and to find meaning in a world that can sometimes feel empty and overwhelming. And who knows, they might just join you in your war, or at the very least, they'll understand and respect your battle.\n\nRemember, you're not alone in this war. There are people who care about you, who want to support you, and who want to help you navigate the complexities of grief. And even if it doesn't feel like it right now, you are strong enough to get through this. You are resilient, and you are capable of finding a way to heal and move forward, one tie at a time."

True strength, as you're discovering, lies in being able to feel, to be vulnerable, and to be open to the complexities of human experience.\n\nLetting everything touch you, as you put it, means being willing to be affected, to be changed, and to be shaped by the world around you. It means being brave enough to be vulnerable, to take risks, and to be open to the possibility of being hurt. And yet, it's in this vulnerability that we find the strength to get dressed in the morning, to face the day, and to keep moving forward, even when it feels like the world is weighing us down.\n\nThis is a powerful lesson, and one that can be applied to so many areas of life. It's a reminder that strength is not about being invincible, but about being resilient, about being able to bend and flex in the face of adversity, and about being willing to be transformed by our experiences.\n\nI think this is especially important for men, who are often socialized to suppress their emotions and to present a stoic exterior to the world. But as you're learning, true strength lies in being able to express our emotions, to be vulnerable, and to be open to the complexities of human experience.\n\nSo, I think it's amazing that you're having this realization, and that you're embracing the idea that strength means being willing to be touched, to be affected, and to be changed by the world around you. That takes a lot of courage, and it's a sign of true strength and resilience."

It means being willing to confront your emotions, to challenge your thoughts and behaviors, and to make changes that help you become a better version of yourself.\n\nAnd it's amazing that you wore the blue paisley tie today and didn't think about Margaret until lunch! That's a huge step forward, and it shows that you're making progress in your journey towards healing. It's not that you'll never think about Margaret again, but it's about learning to navigate your emotions and memories in a way that allows you to live your life fully.\n\nIt's also beautiful that your daughter is supporting you on this journey. Having someone who believes in you and encourages you to keep moving forward can make all the difference. And it's clear that she's proud of you, not just for wearing a tie, but for being brave enough to face your emotions and to keep going, even when it's hard.\n\nYou know, it's funny, but sometimes it's the small moments, like wearing a certain tie or getting through a morning without thinking about someone, that can be the most significant. They might seem insignificant to others, but to you, they're a reminder that you're making progress, that you're healing, and that you're finding a way to move forward.\n\nSo, keep doing the work, and know that your daughter is proud of you.

What if you could create a collage or a series of frames, each with a different photo that captures a special moment or memory?\n\nOr, what if you chose a photo that doesn't necessarily have to be of Margaret, but one that reminds you of her, or a place that holds special meaning to the two of you? Sometimes, it's not about the person in the photo, but the emotions and memories that it evokes.\n\nRemember, there's no right or wrong choice here. The photo you choose will be a personal reflection of your love and memories of Margaret, and it's okay if it takes time to decide. You could even try putting a few different photos in the frame and seeing which one feels right, or which one sparks the most memories and emotions.\n\nUltimately, the photo you choose will be a way to keep Margaret's memory close to your heart, and to celebrate the love and life you shared together.
