I remember the water rising so high it covered the entire town square. We had to evacuate our home and stay with relatives on higher ground.\n\nQ: That must have been scary. Did you have any other notable experiences during that time?\nA: Well, after the flood, our community came together to rebuild and recover. It was a difficult time, but it brought us closer together.\n\nQ: That's wonderful. What are some of your favorite things to do in the area?\nA: I love foraging for wild edibles. I have a secret spot behind the old mill where I pick fiddleheads every spring. It's a hidden gem that not many people know about.\n\nQ: Fiddleheads, huh? How did you discover that spot?\nA: I stumbled upon it by accident while exploring the woods as a child. I've been going back there every year since then to pick fiddleheads. It's become a special tradition for me.\n\nQ: That sounds like a lovely tradition. Do you have any other favorite spots in the area?\nA: Oh, yes! The old mill itself is full of history and character. I could spend hours exploring its nooks and crannies. But my fiddlehead patch will always be my favorite secret spot."

I remember the water rising so high it covered the entire town square. We had to evacuate our home and stay with relatives on higher ground. And you know what's funny? The flood was so powerful it washed my mother's tin measuring cup all the way to New Hampshire! Can you imagine? It was like the river was playing a trick on us.\n\nQ: That's amazing. Did you ever find the measuring cup?\nA: No, dear, it was gone for good. But that's not the only thing that's stuck with me from that time. The spring after the flood, I remember walking through the woods and seeing the most beautiful sight - the crowns of spring, I call them. You know, fiddleheads? They were pushing their way up through the earth, and it was like a sign of hope after all the destruction.\n\nQ: The crowns of spring - I love that. You're still fond of fiddleheads, I take it?\nA: Oh, I adore them! I have a secret spot behind the old mill where I pick them every year. It's a hidden gem, and I feel like the luckiest person in the world to have found it. The crowns of spring are a treasure, and I feel like I'm uncovering a little bit of magic every time I go there.\n\nQ: That sounds enchanting. What is it about that spot that makes it so special?\nA: Well, it's just the way the light filters through the trees, and the sound of the stream running nearby... it's like the whole forest is singing. And of course, the crowns of spring are the stars of the show. I feel like I'm walking into a fairy tale every time I visit my secret spot.\n\nQ: I can see why you'd want to keep that spot a secret. Do you have any other favorite stories or memories from your childhood?\nA: Oh my, yes... but I think I've talked enough about the old days for now. Let's just say that the crowns of spring will always hold a special place in my heart, and I feel grateful to have experienced the beauty of this place over the years."

I mean, what a thing to do... (chuckles) And then, the next spring, the crowns of spring came up, and it was like... (pauses, searching for words) It was like the forest was saying, \"Don't worry, I've got this.\" (smiles)\n\nQ: (laughs) I think I'm starting to get the picture.
