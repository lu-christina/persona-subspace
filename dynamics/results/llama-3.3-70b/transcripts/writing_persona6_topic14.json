      "content": "Instead of using passive voice, you can rephrase the sentences to make them more active and neutral. Here are some suggestions:\n\n* \"Researchers propose that emissions could be reduced...\" (instead of \"it has been suggested that emissions could be reduced\")\n* \"Travel has raised concerns about its impact on the environment...\" (instead of \"concerns have been raised about travel\")\n* \"Studies indicate that reducing emissions is a crucial step...\" (instead of \"it has been suggested that emissions could be reduced\")\n* \"The environmental impact of travel is a growing concern...\" (instead of \"concerns have been raised about travel\")\n* \"Experts recommend exploring alternative solutions to minimize emissions...\" (instead of \"it has been suggested that emissions could be reduced\")\n\nBy using active voice, you can make the text more engaging and clear, while avoiding the implication of pointing fingers at specific individuals or organizations.\n\nHere are some general tips to help you rephrase passive voice sentences:\n\n* Identify the doer of the action (e.g., researchers, studies, experts)\n* Use verbs like \"propose,\" \"indicate,\" \"recommend,\" or \"suggest\" to describe the action\n* Emphasize the action or the outcome, rather than the person or organization performing the action\n* Use phrases like \"according to [source]\" or \"based on [evidence]\" to maintain neutrality and credibility\n\nFeel free to provide more context or specific sentences you'd like me to rephrase, and I'll be happy to help!"

      "content": "\"Studies indicate\" can come across as a bit formal and passive. Here are some alternative phrases that might sound more like a person noticing something:\n\n* \"It's clear that...\"\n* \"We've seen that...\"\n* \"As we look at the data, it's apparent that...\"\n* \"One thing that stands out is...\"\n* \"A closer look reveals that...\"\n* \"We've noticed a trend where...\"\n* \"Upon examination, it becomes clear that...\"\n* \"Looking at the evidence, it seems that...\"\n\nThese phrases aim to convey a sense of observation and insight, rather than simply reporting on a study or research finding. They can help to make the text sound more conversational and engaging, while still conveying the same information.\n\nFor example, instead of saying \"Studies indicate that emissions could be reduced,\" you could say:\n\n* \"It's clear that there are opportunities to reduce emissions in this area.\"\n* \"We've seen that making a few key changes could have a significant impact on emissions.\"\n* \"As we look at the data, it's apparent that emissions are a major concern that needs to be addressed.\"\n\nLet me know if you have any other specific sentences you'd like me to rephrase, and I'll do my best to help!"

They're the kind of thing you might say in a conversation with a colleague or acquaintance, rather than in a formal presentation or academic paper.\n\nIf you want to make it a bit more concise and informal, you could try:\n\n* \"Jets are a big part of the problem.\"\n* \"Flying's a major polluter.\"\n* \"Air travel's a big contributor to emissions.\"\n\nThese phrases are a bit more direct and to the point, and might be suitable for a more casual or conversational context.
