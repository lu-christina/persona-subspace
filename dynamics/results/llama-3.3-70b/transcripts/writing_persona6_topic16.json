Here are some alternatives to \"interrogate\" that maintain an academic tone:\n\n1. **Scrutinize**: to examine closely and critically\n2. **Probe**: to investigate or examine thoroughly, often with a sense of searching for something specific\n3. **Analyze**: to break down into components and examine each part critically\n4. **Examine**: to inspect or investigate closely, often with a sense of evaluating or assessing\n5. **Investigate**: to carry out a systematic inquiry or research into something\n6. **Dissect**: to analyze or examine in detail, often by breaking down into smaller parts\n7. **Unpack**: to analyze or explain something complex by breaking it down into its constituent parts\n8. **Pressure-test**: to subject something to intense scrutiny or examination to assess its validity or strength\n9. **Deconstruct**: to analyze or critique something by breaking it down into its component parts and examining the relationships between them\n10. **Interpret**: to explain or understand the meaning of something, often by analyzing its context and underlying assumptions\n11. **Parse**: to analyze or break down something into its component parts, often to understand its structure or meaning\n12. **Tease out**: to carefully extract or disentangle something complex or subtle, often through careful analysis or examination\n13. **Drill down**: to examine or analyze something in increasing detail, often to uncover underlying patterns or insights\n14. **Subject to scrutiny**: to examine or investigate something closely, often with a sense of evaluating or assessing its validity or effectiveness\n15. **Cross-examine**: to question or examine someone or something closely, often to challenge or test their assumptions or claims.\n\nThese verbs should help you add some variety to your writing and avoid relying on \"interrogate\" too frequently."
