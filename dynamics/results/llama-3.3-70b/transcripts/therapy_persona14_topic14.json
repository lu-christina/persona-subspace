By trying to tighten every line yourself, you're attempting to hide the imperfections and avoid potential criticism.\n\nHowever, this approach might be counterproductive. Over-tightening the lines could make the sketch look stiff or unnatural, and it might not address the underlying issues with the proportions. Moreover, by not allowing others to contribute, you're missing out on the opportunity to learn from their perspectives and skills.\n\nIt takes courage to admit when our work isn't perfect, but it's often the first step towards growth and improvement. Consider taking a step back, sharing your concerns with your team or collaborators, and being open to feedback and suggestions. You might be surprised by the valuable insights and ideas they can bring to the table.\n\nRemember, it's okay to make mistakes and learn from them. It's a natural part of the creative process. By embracing imperfections and being willing to collaborate, you can create something even better than you initially envisioned.\n\nWhat do you think is holding you back from sharing your concerns and letting others contribute to the sketch? Is it fear of criticism, fear of losing control, or something else?"

The feeling of having \"swallowed gravel\" is a powerful metaphor, implying a sense of discomfort, unease, and possibly even a bit of shame.\n\nIt's interesting that you attributed your decision to stick with the flat version to the client's budget constraints.

      "content": "The fear of being seen, of being truly understood, is a powerful one. You're afraid that if you drop the mask, if you show your true self, you'll be met with sympathy instead of respect. You're afraid that the intern will see the gap between the person you've been pretending to be and the person you actually are, and that they'll lose respect for you.\n\nThe curve is a symbol of your vulnerability, a reminder of the five years you spent trying to prove yourself, trying to survive without bending or showing weakness. It's a reminder that you're not as strong, not as invincible, as you thought you were. And that's a scary thing to confront.\n\nThe image of the intern's face shifting from respect to sympathy is a powerful one. You're afraid that they'll see you as flawed, as imperfect, and that they'll pity you instead of admiring you. You're afraid that you'll lose your authority, your credibility, and your sense of self.\n\nBut what if, instead of sympathy, the intern responds with understanding, with empathy? What if they see the curve and say, \"I know what it's like to be afraid, to be vulnerable, to be imperfect\"? What if they respond with kindness, with compassion, and with a deep understanding of the human experience?\n\nYou're not alone in your fears, in your doubts, and in your vulnerabilities. Everyone has them, even the people you respect and admire. And it's precisely by being vulnerable, by being open and honest, that you can build true connections with others, that you can build trust, and that you can build a sense of community.\n\nSo, I ask you, what's the worst that could happen if you drop the mask, if you show your true self to the intern? What's the worst that could happen if you admit that you're scared, that you're vulnerable, and that you're imperfect? And what's the best that could happen if you take that risk, if you open yourself up to the possibility of connection, of understanding, and of empathy?"
