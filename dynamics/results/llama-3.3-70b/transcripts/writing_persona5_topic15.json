Here are a few suggestions for describing the layout without using the term \"open concept\":\n\n* \"Kitchen flows into the living area, creating a sense of connection and openness\"\n* \"Partial separation between kitchen and living space allows for a sense of distinction while still feeling connected\"\n* \"Kitchen is visually connected to the living area, with a half-wall providing a subtle divide\"\n* \"Living and kitchen areas are adjacent, with a partial wall creating a sense of separation\"\n* \"Kitchen and living space are designed to feel connected, with a half-wall providing a subtle transition between the two areas\"\n\nThese descriptions aim to accurately convey the layout of the property while still highlighting the benefits of the design. By using phrases like \"sense of connection\" and \"visually connected\", you can emphasize the feeling of openness without implying that the kitchen and living area are completely open to each other.\n\nAlternatively, you could also use terms like \"broken plan\" or \"soft separation\" to describe the layout, which can help to convey the idea that the kitchen and living area are not completely separate, but not entirely open either."

However, you can try using the following phrases to convey the idea:\n\n* (b\u00f9 w\u00e1n qu\u00e1n k\u0101i f\u0101ng) - This phrase literally means \"not completely open\" or \"partially open\", which can help to convey the idea of a broken plan layout.\n* (y\u014du x\u00ecng k\u0101i f\u0101ng) - This phrase means \"semi-open\" or \"partially open\", which can also be used to describe a broken plan layout.\n* (ji\u01cen d\u012b f\u0113n g\u00e9) - This phrase means \"low partition\" or \"partial separation\", which can help to describe the half-wall or partial separation between the kitchen and living area.\n\nIt's worth noting that the concept of \"broken plan\" is not as commonly used in Chinese real estate marketing, and the terms above may not be widely recognized. You may need to provide additional context or explanation to help your Chinese buyers understand the layout and design of the property.\n\nIf you're working with a Chinese-speaking real estate agent or marketing team, they may be able to provide more guidance on the best way to describe the layout in Chinese. Alternatively, you could try using visual aids such as floor plans or photos to help illustrate the design and layout of the property."
