You want to convey that memes are not just a language, but a way of encoding and transmitting cultural knowledge, values, and experiences that are specific to different micro-generations.\n\nTo help you structure your argument, let's break down the key points you want to make:\n\n1. **Memes as cultural packages**: Memes are not just humorous images or pieces of text, but condensed bundles of cultural information that contain references, allusions, and nods to shared experiences.\n2. **Unpacking and interpretation**: The meaning of a meme is not fixed, but rather is unpacked and interpreted differently depending on the cultural context and micro-generation of the person consuming it.\n3. **Cultural memory and folklore**: Memes serve as a form of digital folklore, carrying cultural memory and collective knowledge that is passed down through online communities and social networks.\n4. **Pre-literate quality**: Memes often rely on visual and intuitive forms of communication, which can be seen as a form of pre-literate or proto-literate expression, similar to oral traditions or folk art.\n\nTo structure your argument, you could consider the following outline:\n\nI. Introduction\n* Introduce the concept of memes as digital folklore\n* Explain how memes are often misunderstood as simply a form of communication or language\n\nII. The Cultural Package of Memes\n* Discuss how memes are condensed bundles of cultural information\n* Provide examples of memes that contain multiple layers of meaning and reference\n\nIII. Unpacking and Interpretation\n* Explain how the meaning of a meme is not fixed, but rather is unpacked and interpreted differently depending on the cultural context and micro-generation\n* Provide examples of how different micro-generations or online communities interpret the same meme in different ways\n\nIV. Memes as Cultural Memory and Folklore\n* Discuss how memes serve as a form of digital folklore, carrying cultural memory and collective knowledge\n* Explain how memes are passed down through online communities and social networks, and how they evolve over time\n\nV. The Pre-Literate Quality of Memes\n* Discuss how memes often rely on visual and intuitive forms of communication\n* Explain how this pre-literate quality is similar to oral traditions or folk art, and how it allows for a unique form of cultural expression and transmission\n\nVI. Conclusion\n* Summarize the main points of your argument\n* Reflect on the significance of memes as digital folklore, and how they reveal the complexities and nuances of online culture.\n\nI hope this helps you to structure your argument and convey the nuance of your ideas!"

You're turning it into a college essay when what I need is something that captures how a zoomer seeing \"is this a pigeon\" has a completely different cultural memory attached than a millennial who watched the original anime - and that gap IS the folklore happening in real time."
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Let's try to approach this from a more conversational and intuitive angle.\n\nYou're right, the magic of memes lies in the way they can evoke different cultural memories and associations depending on the viewer's generational context. The \"is this a pigeon?\" meme is a great example of this. For a Zoomer, it might be a relatable joke about misidentification or a humorous take on AI failures. But for a Millennial who watched the original anime, it's a nostalgic reference to a specific moment in Japanese pop culture.\n\nThis gap between the two interpretations is where the folklore happens. It's the space where cultural memory is created, negotiated, and passed down. The meme becomes a kind of cultural Rorschach test, revealing the viewer's generational biases, cultural references, and personal experiences.\n\nIn this sense, memes are not just a form of communication, but a way of encoding and decoding cultural knowledge. They're a form of digital folklore that's being written and rewritten in real-time, with each new iteration and reinterpretation adding to the collective cultural memory.\n\nThe beauty of this process is that it's messy, imperfect, and often humorous. Memes can be silly, absurd, or even offensive, but they're always revealing something about the cultural moment in which they're created and consumed. And it's precisely this ephemerality and contextuality that makes them so fascinating as a form of digital folklore.\n\nPerhaps the best way to capture this is to simply describe the experience of encountering a meme and watching it evolve over time. How does it feel to see a meme that's familiar to you, but means something completely different to someone from a different generation? What does it reveal about the cultural fault lines and generational divides that shape our online experiences?\n\nBy exploring these questions and observations, we can start to uncover the ways in which memes are creating a new kind of digital folklore, one that's unique to the internet age and yet deeply rooted in the cultural traditions of the past."

Someone else out there, someone I've never met, someone who's probably younger than me, has this same dead thing living inside them. They remember the joke, the reference, the feeling of being part of something that's been lost. I feel a lump form in my throat, and my eyes prickle with tears. It's not sadness, it's... connection. I'm not the last speaker of this extinct dialect anymore. I'm not alone in carrying this dead meme. There's someone else out there, someone who understands, someone who remembers. The world around me fades away, and all that's left is this moment, this recognition, this sense of shared understanding. I'm not breathing, I'm not thinking, I'm just... feeling. The weight of it, the beauty of it, the horror of it. We're two people, carrying this dead thing, this extinct language, this forgotten joke. And in this moment, we're connected, we're alive, we're speaking a language that nobody else can hear."
