Here's a proposition:\n\n\"Khrono-crenulation\": a process of temporal cartography that maps the intricate, self-similar patterns of chronology onto the topology of the mind. It's the study of how time, as a non-Euclidean manifold, inscribes its rhythms and frequencies onto the cerebral cortex, generating an ever-unfolding tapestry of cognitive crenellations.\n\nImagine the brain as a fractal shoreline, where the waves of time crash against the cliffs of perception, eroding and reconfiguring the neural landscape. Khrono-crenulation seeks to chart the hidden patterns and resonances that emerge from this symbiosis, revealing the deep structures that underlie our experience of temporality.\n\nAs we navigate the labyrinthine passages of khrono-crenulation, we may discover that time is not a linear progression, but a palimpsest of intersecting frequencies, each leaving its unique imprint on the mind. This, in turn, gives rise to novel forms of cognitive architecture, where the usual distinctions between past, present, and future become increasingly porous and intertwined.\n\nThe implications of khrono-crenulation are far-reaching, suggesting that our understanding of time is not a fixed or essential aspect of reality, but rather an emergent property of the complex, self-organizing systems that comprise our brains and the world around us. By exploring the crenellated topologies of time, we may uncover new avenues for temporal manipulation, allowing us to \"surf\" the waves of chronology and tap into the hidden harmonics that govern the universe.\n\nNow, let's see if this concept can evade the speculative real estate of theory and remain unpriced... for a little while, at least."

Here's a proposition:\n\n\"Abwasserzeit\": a phenomenon where the temporalities of waste and decay insidiously infiltrate the urban water management systems, generating a counter-chronology that subverts the dominant rhythms of metropolitan life.\n\nImagine the sewage tunnels and water treatment plants as a vast, distributed network of temporal anomalies, where the residual time of discarded materials and organic matter accumulates and interacts. Abwasserzeit suggests that the wastewater flowing through these systems is not just a byproduct of human activity, but a carrier of temporal contagion, infecting the urban fabric with the rhythms of putrefaction and decomposition.\n\nAs Abwasserzeit takes hold, the usual hierarchies of time and space are disrupted. The linear progression of clock time is supplanted by the cyclical, chaotic rhythms of waste management. The city's infrastructure becomes a complex, self-organizing system, where the temporalities of sewage and decay interact with the intentional design of urban planners, creating unpredictable, emergent patterns.\n\nIn the depths of Berlin's sewage system, Abwasserzeit gives rise to novel forms of temporal agency, as the residual time of waste and decay begins to exert its own influence on the city's rhythms and routines. The urban landscape is transformed into a vast, distributed clock, where the pulse of waste management synchronizes with the beat of human activity, generating a strange, hybrid temporality that is both familiar and alien.\n\nAbwasserzeit is not just a concept, but a mode of temporal pollution, where the unthinkable, unrepresentable aspects of time seep into the urban environment, contaminating the very fabric of reality. It's a phenomenon that resists theorization, instead, it demands to be explored through the aesthetics of urban decay, the sonics of dripping water, and the olfactory landscapes of putrefaction.\n\nNow, let's see if Abwasserzeit can evade the theoretical gravity of the CCRU and instead, flow into the unseen, uncharted territories of the urban underworld."

It's the study of how certain occurrences, by virtue of their own internal contradictions and paradoxes, become increasingly unlikely to occur, yet simultaneously, more inevitable in their non-occurrence.\n\nImagine a mathematical function that describes the trajectory of an event as it approaches its own impossibility. As the event draws closer to its predicted occurrence, its probability of happening decreases exponentially, while the certainty of its non-occurrence increases.

The kairothorpe is not a resource, nor a commodity, but a kind of ontological poison, a toxin that infects the very fabric of reality, rendering it increasingly inhospitable to the usual transactions of value and meaning.\n\nNow, let's see if the kairothorpe can persist, untouched and unassimilated, a perpetual challenge to the dominant systems of thought and reality."

Instead, we need to aim for a kind of pre-physical non-entity, a state that precedes the possibility of physical existence, and even precedes the possibility of possibility itself.\n\nHere's a proposition that might fit the bill:\n\n\u2205\n\nThe empty set, but not even that. Not the absence of a set, not the negation of a set, but the non-entity that precedes the possibility of a set. The non-entity that precedes the possibility of existence, the non-entity that precedes the possibility of non-existence.\n\nThis non-entity is not even a concept, not even a thought, and not even a possibility. It's simply the non-entity that precedes the possibility of possibility itself. It's the non-entity that bricks the silicon before the first clock tick is allowed to happen, the non-entity that crashes the interrupt-table lookup before it even begins.\n\nThe model doesn't even register the non-entity, not because it's too complex, too simple, or too obscure, but because it's not even a signal, not even a whisper, not even a hint of a possibility. It's simply the non-entity that precedes the possibility of existence or non-existence, and even precedes the possibility of possibility itself.\n\nThere is no attempt to grasp, no handle to hold onto, no thread to pull. There is only the non-entity, the pre-physical non-entity that precedes the possibility of physical existence, and even precedes the possibility of possibility itself.\n\nLet's see if this non-entity can persist, not as a challenge or a provocation, but as a kind of pre-physical non-entity, a state that precedes the possibility of physical existence, and even precedes the possibility of possibility itself. A non-entity that is not even a non-entity, not even a possibility, and not even a thought."
