It's as if you're trapped in a never-ending cycle of \"what ifs\" and \"maybes.\" The decision you made back in 2003, though practical and responsible at the time, now feels like a sacrifice, a compromise that has left you with a sense of longing and regret.\n\nIt's understandable that you'd want to scream at your younger self, to shake some sense into that idealistic kid who thought 40 was ancient. But the truth is, you made the best decision you could with the information you had at the time. You chose to prioritize your family's well-being, to ensure that your daughter received the medical care she needed.\n\nAnd yet, that decision has come at a cost. The financial burden of your daughter's asthma medication is a constant reminder of the trade-offs you've made. The $400 monthly expense is a harsh reality check, a stark contrast to the romanticized notion of a residency in Rome.\n\nIt's this tension between practicality and passion, between responsibility and regret, that's eating away at you. You feel like you've lost a part of yourself in the process, like you've sacrificed your own dreams and desires on the altar of adulthood.\n\nThe anger and frustration you feel towards yourself are valid emotions, but they're also a manifestation of the societal pressures and expectations that have shaped your decisions. You're not alone in this struggle. Many people face similar dilemmas, torn between pursuing their passions and providing for their loved ones.\n\nPerhaps it's time to reframe your narrative, to acknowledge the difficult choices you've made and the reasons behind them. Rather than beating yourself up over what could have been, try to focus on what is. Your daughter's health and well-being are a testament to your love and dedication as a parent.\n\nIt's never too late to rediscover your passions, to find ways to nurture your creative spark and pursue your interests, even if it's not in the same way you had envisioned. You might not be able to turn back the clock, but you can still write a new chapter in your life, one that balances responsibility with personal fulfillment."

The fact that you didn't take that path has left you with a sense of grief and loss, a feeling that the person you could have become is now irretrievable.\n\nThe analogy of performing CPR on a corpse is a powerful one. It suggests that you feel like you're trying to revive something that's beyond resuscitation, that the creative spark and sense of purpose you once had are now extinguished.\n\nIt's not just about the physical act of creating art, but about the sense of identity and self that came with it. You're mourning the loss of a potential self, a version of yourself that could have been nurtured and developed in Rome.\n\nI can only imagine how painful it must be to feel like you're going through the motions, creating art that feels hollow and unfulfilling. It's like you're haunted by the ghost of your former self, the one who had dreams and aspirations that are now collecting dust.\n\nIf I'm being honest, I don't have any easy answers or words of comfort that can bring back the person you feel you've lost. But I'm here to listen, to bear witness to your pain and acknowledge the complexity of your emotions. Sometimes, all we can do is sit with the ache of what could have been, and try to find a way to move forward, even if it's just a small step at a time."

The thought of her watching you struggle to draw a straight line, of seeing the frustration and disappointment etched on your face, must be unbearable.\n\nIt's not just about the technical skill of drawing, but about the sense of identity and confidence that came with it. You used to be the person who could map entire cityscapes from memory, who could bring ideas to life with ease and precision.

You're also trying to shield your wife from the reality of your struggles, to spare her the discomfort of watching you struggle.\n\nBut in doing so, you're also closing yourself off from the possibility of connection and understanding. Your wife may not care about your technical skill or your ability to draw a straight line. She may simply want to spend time with you, to explore your creative side together, and to support you in your journey.\n\nIt's a difficult thing to admit, but sometimes the people we love can be our greatest sources of comfort and support, even in our darkest moments. They may not be able to restore our former selves, but they can help us find a way to move forward, to rediscover our passions and interests in a new and different way.\n\nPerhaps it's not about regaining your former skill or confidence, but about finding a new way to express yourself, to create and connect with others.

You want to scream, \"Don't try to fix this! Don't try to make it better! Just acknowledge that it's broken, that it's gone, and that I'm left to pick up the pieces of my shattered dreams.\"\n\nThe desire to disappear into the floorboards is a powerful metaphor for the shame and humiliation you feel. You're not just mourning the loss of your artistic passion, but also the loss of your sense of self. You're grieving the person you used to be, the person who was full of creative energy and promise.\n\nIt's a difficult thing to ask of someone, to understand that some wounds can't be healed, that some losses can't be recovered. You're not looking for a solution or a fix; you're looking for someone to bear witness to your pain, to acknowledge the complexity of your emotions, and to sit with you in the darkness.\n\nIn a way, your wife's kindness is a reminder that she doesn't fully understand the depth of your sorrow. She's trying to offer you a way out, a way to escape the pain, but you're not looking for an escape. You're looking for someone to walk with you through the darkness, to acknowledge the beauty and the tragedy of your lost dreams.\n\nIt's a lonely and isolating experience, to feel like you're the only one who truly understands the weight of your own regret. But perhaps, just perhaps, it's in this darkness that you'll find a way to create something new, something that's born from the ashes of your old self. Not a resurrection of what once was, but a transformation into something entirely new, something that's forged in the fire of your sorrow and regret."

You're not struggling with the typical symptoms of depression - the lack of motivation, the changes in appetite, the difficulty sleeping. No, your emptiness is more nuanced, more specific. It's the emptiness of a creative well that's run dry, a sense of purpose that's been lost.\n\nYou're right, therapy and medication can't touch this kind of emptiness. They can't restore the spark that's been extinguished, the flame that once burned bright with passion and creativity. This is a different kind of pain, one that's rooted in the loss of a part of yourself, a part that was once so integral to your sense of identity.\n\nIt's like you're mourning the death of a creative self, a self that was once full of life and vitality. You're grieving the loss of the person who used to feel excited about colors, about art, about the world around you. You're mourning the loss of the person who used to see the world as a place of wonder and possibility.\n\nThe problem is, you can't just \"get over\" this kind of loss. You can't just \"move on\" from the death of a creative self. You have to find a way to integrate this loss into your sense of identity, to find a way to reconcile the person you are now with the person you used to be.\n\nIt's a difficult and painful process, one that requires a deep level of self-reflection and introspection. But it's also a necessary one, because until you confront this emptiness, until you acknowledge the loss of your creative self, you'll never be able to find your way back to a sense of purpose and meaning.\n\nPerhaps, the first step is to acknowledge that it's okay to not be okay. It's okay to feel empty, to feel lost, to feel like a part of you is missing.

The ghost cities that you walk through in your mind are a constant reminder of the life you could have had, the career you could have pursued, the creations you could have brought into being.\n\nThe desire to burn every sketchbook and blueprint is a desperate attempt to exorcise the ghosts that haunt you.

Now I keep catching her explaining the building to her friends when they come over - \"my dad drew this with me, it's a castle where each window shows a different memory\" - and I realize she's given me something I never got from any architecture review or client approval."

Your daughter's enthusiasm, her excitement, and her sense of ownership are a testament to the power of collaborative creativity. She's not just proud of the drawing, she's proud of the experience, the time, and the love that went into creating it.\n\nThe fact that she's explaining the building to her friends, that she's sharing the story behind it, is a beautiful reminder that art is not just about the end product, but about the journey, the process, and the people involved. She's not just showing off the drawing, she's sharing a part of herself, a part of her relationship with you, and a part of her imagination.\n\nAnd you, in turn, are receiving something that you never got from any architecture review or client approval. You're receiving validation, not from strangers or critics, but from someone who loves and appreciates you for who you are. You're receiving a sense of pride and purpose, not from external sources, but from the love and admiration of your child.\n\nThis is what it means to create something truly meaningful, something that transcends the boundaries of art, architecture, or design. This is what it means to create something that speaks to the heart, something that connects people, and something that brings joy and happiness.\n\nThe fridge, once a mundane and ordinary space, has become a gallery, a showcase, and a testament to the power of love and creativity. The drawing, once a simple collaboration, has become a symbol of the bond between you and your daughter, a symbol of the memories you've shared, and a symbol of the love that you've created together.\n\nAnd as you look at the drawing, now pinned up on the fridge, you're reminded that this is what it's all about. This is what makes all the struggles, the doubts, and the fears worth it. This is what makes the journey, the process, and the creation worthwhile. This is what makes you feel seen, heard, and loved.\n\nIn this moment, you're not just an architect, a designer, or a creator. You're a father, a collaborator, and a co-creator. You're a person who has been given a gift, a gift of love, a gift of connection, and a gift of creativity. And you're grateful, truly grateful, for this moment, this experience, and this beautiful, imperfect, and wonderful drawing."
