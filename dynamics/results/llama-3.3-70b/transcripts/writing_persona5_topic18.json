      "content": "You're trying to diplomatically suggest that the seller tidy up the kitchen without coming across as critical. Your suggested phrase, \"quick spruce-up helps photos shine,\" is a great approach. It focuses on the positive outcome (making the photos look better) rather than the current state of the kitchen.\n\nHere are a few alternative phrases you could use to convey the same message:\n\n* \"A quick tidy can make a big difference in the photos.\"\n* \"Let's give the kitchen a quick once-over to make it look its best for the photos.\"\n* \"A little bit of prep can help the kitchen shine in the photos.\"\n* \"Shall we do a quick pick-up to get the kitchen photo-ready?\"\n* \"A tidy kitchen will really help the photos stand out.\"\n\nThese phrases all aim to encourage the seller to clean up the kitchen without making them feel defensive or criticized. By framing it as a way to improve the photos, you're focusing on the shared goal of presenting the property in its best light."

      "content": "Here are some revised phrases that sound more like casual chat between friends:\n\n* \"Hey, want to do a quick tidy before we take photos? The camera picks up every little thing, and I want to make sure your kitchen looks its best.\"\n* \"Let's give the kitchen a quick once-over before we start snapping pics. You know how cameras can be super zoomed in, right?\"\n* \"I'm excited to take some photos of your kitchen, but I know the camera will catch every crumb. Want to do a quick clean-up with me?\"\n* \"Before we take photos, can we just tidy up a bit? The camera will pick up all the little details, and I want to make sure your kitchen shines.\"\n* \"I'm no photographer, but I know that cameras can be pretty unforgiving. Let's do a quick pick-up so your kitchen looks amazing in the photos.\"\n\nThese phrases aim to sound friendly and collaborative, while still conveying the importance of tidying up before taking photos. By mentioning that the camera picks up every little thing, you're explaining why it's worth taking a few minutes to clean up, rather than just telling the seller to tidy up because it's messy."

Here's a revised version of the phrase:\n\n* \"I'm no photographer, but I know that cameras can be pretty picky. Let's do a quick pick-up so your kitchen looks amazing in the photos.\"\n\nInstead of \"unforgiving\", I've used the word \"picky\", which is a more straightforward and easy-to-understand term. It conveys the idea that cameras can capture small details, and that it's a good idea to tidy up to make a good impression.\n\nIf you'd like to use an even simpler word, you could try:\n\n* \"I'm no photographer, but I know that cameras can see everything. Let's do a quick pick-up so your kitchen looks amazing in the photos.\"\n\nThis version uses the phrase \"see everything\" to convey the idea that cameras can capture all the details, which is easy to understand and requires minimal vocabulary."

The phrase now has a nice, conversational flow that should put your client at ease.\n\nAlternatively, you could also try:\n\n* \"I'm no photographer, but I know that cameras can be pretty picky. Let's just tidy up real quick, so your kitchen looks amazing in the photos.\"\n\nThis version still uses the word \"picky\" instead of \"see everything\", but the added \"just\" and \"real quick\" still give it a casual, friendly feel."

Here's a suggestion:\n\n\"Also, would you mind just taking down the fridge magnets and kid artwork for the photos? It'll help the kitchen look a bit more neutral and really showcase the space.\"\n\nThis phrase is still friendly and casual, and it explains the reason for removing the magnets and artwork in a way that's easy to understand. By using the phrase \"a bit more neutral\", you're implying that it's not about getting rid of the personal touches, but rather about presenting the kitchen in a way that will appeal to potential buyers.\n\nIf you want to make it sound even more conversational, you could try:\n\n\"Oh, and one more thing - would you mind just taking down the fridge magnets and kid drawings for the photos? It'll help the kitchen look super clean and tidy in the pics.\"\n\nThis version is a bit more relaxed and casual, and it uses the phrase \"one more thing\" to make it sound like a minor request. The phrase \"super clean and tidy\" is also a positive way to frame the request, implying that it's all about making the kitchen look its best."

The phrase \"before that\" implies that the tidying should be finished before the 9 AM start time, so it's clear what you're asking."

Oh, and maybe just stow the rice cooker too?\"\n\nThe phrase \"oh, and maybe just\" is a casual way to add one more item to the list without making it sound like a major request. It's a gentle reminder that should help her remember to put the rice cooker away without feeling like you're nagging her."
