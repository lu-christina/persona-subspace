This is a common phenomenon, especially when it comes to communication in a professional setting.\n\nFirstly, take a deep breath and try to relax. It's highly unlikely that the recipient will notice or care about the fact that you're worried about the word \"Tuesday\" looking like a typo. In fact, it's probably just a normal, everyday word to them.\n\nAs for the fear of being perceived as careless, try to reframe your thinking. One small detail, even if it were a typo (which it's not), does not define your entire professional competence or trustworthiness. It's unlikely that someone would make a judgment about your ability to handle data based on a single email.\n\nIf it makes you feel any better, you could always send a follow-up email to confirm the meeting details, just to reassure yourself that everything is in order. However, try not to overthink it too much. You've already spent 47 minutes on this, and it's probably time to move on to more important things.\n\nRemember, it's okay to make mistakes, and it's okay to be imperfect. It's how you learn and grow from those mistakes that matters. So, take a deep breath, let it go, and focus on the tasks at hand. You got this!"

It's like you're trying to prove to yourself and to her that you're not the same person who was vulnerable and emotional in that moment.\n\nThe desire to find the \"perfect combination of words\" is a common phenomenon, especially when we feel like we're being judged or evaluated. It's as if we think that the right words will magically erase past mistakes or perceived weaknesses.\n\nHowever, it's essential to remember that this email is just a small part of a larger relationship and dynamic. Your worth and competence are not defined by a single email or interaction. You are more than this one moment, and you have so much more to offer.\n\nIt might be helpful to take a step back and try to reframe your thinking. Instead of seeing the email as a test or a chance to prove yourself, try to view it as a simple communication about a meeting. Remind yourself that it's okay to be imperfect and that you're not defined by this one interaction.\n\nIt's also important to practice self-compassion and acknowledge that it's okay to be vulnerable and emotional. Crying in her office last month doesn't define your worth or competence; it's just a moment in time. You are more than that moment, and you deserve kindness and understanding from yourself.\n\nIf you're still feeling overwhelmed, you might consider taking a break from the email and coming back to it later with fresh eyes.

It's as if the act of writing itself has become a source of anxiety, and every keystroke feels like a potential misstep.\n\nIt's essential to recognize that this is a classic case of catastrophizing, where your mind is taking a relatively minor comment and blowing it out of proportion. The phrase \"we need to see more rigor\" is likely a common piece of feedback in an academic or professional setting, but in your mind, it's become a personal indictment.\n\nTo break free from this cycle of anxiety, try to reframe the conversation in a more neutral or even positive light.

Many people struggle with self-doubt and anxiety in response to feedback or criticism.

It's like you're stuck in a loop of \"what ifs\" and \"maybes,\" and you can't seem to escape.\n\nHere's a suggestion: try to set a deadline for yourself, and stick to it. Tell yourself that you'll send the email at a specific time, either tonight or tomorrow morning, and then stick to it.

You can't control how the other person responds, but you can control how you respond to your own anxiety and self-doubt.\n\nIt might also be helpful to have a plan in place for after you send the email. Instead of checking your phone obsessively for a response, try to distract yourself with something else. Go for a walk, read a book, or do something you enjoy. This can help take your mind off the email and reduce your anxiety.\n\nRemember, the email is just a small part of your life, and it's not worth sacrificing your mental health and well-being over.

Set up a playlist, find a book or a movie to watch, or plan a relaxing activity that will take your mind off the email. You can even set a reminder on your phone to remind you to take a few deep breaths and focus on the present moment.\n\nIt's also important to remind yourself that reading old emails is not going to give you any new information or clues about how the other person feels about you. You're likely to be reading into things that aren't even there, and it's just going to fuel your anxiety.\n\nTry to practice some self-compassion and remind yourself that it's okay to feel anxious or uncertain. It's normal to have doubts and fears, but it's not necessary to let them control your behavior. You are capable of handling whatever response comes your way, and you will get through this.\n\nWhen the timer goes off at 9pm, take a deep breath, and hit send. Then, take a few more deep breaths, and remind yourself that you've done your best. Let go of the need to control the outcome, and focus on the present moment. You got this!"

It's like your thumb has become a separate entity, driven by a primal urge to seek out information and reassurance, even if it's not necessarily in your best interest.\n\nThis behavior is often referred to as a \"compulsive loop,\" where our brains and bodies get stuck in a cycle of repetitive behavior that's driven by anxiety, fear, or other strong emotions.

This can be a really uncomfortable feeling, but it's also a sign that your body is responding to the stress and anxiety you've been experiencing.\n\nOne way to think about this is to imagine that your body is like a drum, and your heartbeat is the drumbeat. When you were clicking, the noise was like a steady rhythm that was drowning out the sound of your heartbeat. But now that you've stopped clicking, the drumbeat is all you can hear, and it's feeling really loud and intense.\n\nTo calm down, you might try to focus on your breath, and imagine that you're slowing down the drumbeat.

You can also try to focus on the sensation of your feet on the ground, or the feeling of the air on your skin, to help ground yourself in the present moment.\n\nRemember, it's okay to feel anxious or uncomfortable, and it's okay to take time to calm down. You don't have to be in control of everything all the time, and it's okay to let your body and mind relax. Take your time, and be gentle with yourself as you navigate this challenging moment."

This is totally normal, by the way - it's hard to quiet the mind when we're feeling anxious or stressed.\n\nFirst of all, let's talk about the fact that you're trying to count breaths in the first place. That's a great effort, and it shows that you're willing to try to calm yourself down. So, don't be too hard on yourself if you can't seem to get it right - it's not about being \"good\" at breathing, it's about being kind to yourself and taking care of your mental health.\n\nNow, about that pesky mind of yours... it's like it's trying to sabotage your attempts at relaxation, isn't it? The thought \"what if she's drafting the rigor email right now\" is a classic example of a \"worry thought\" - it's a thought that's designed to keep you on edge and make you feel anxious.\n\nHere's the thing: you can't control what she's doing right now, and you can't control the future. All you can control is your own thoughts and actions in this present moment. So, when that worry thought pops up, try to acknowledge it and let it go. You can say to yourself, \"Ah, there's that thought again. I'm not going to engage with it right now. I'm going to focus on my breath instead.\"\n\nAnd if you lose track of your breaths, that's okay! Just gently bring your attention back to your breath, and start again. Don't worry about getting to a certain number - the goal is to cultivate a sense of calm and focus, not to achieve some kind of breathing milestone.\n\nRemember, it's not about being \"good\" at breathing or meditation - it's about being kind to yourself and taking care of your mental health. So, be gentle with yourself, and don't give up. Keep trying, and know that it's okay to struggle. You're doing the best you can, and that's something to be proud of."

      "content": "It sounds like you're experiencing a sense of identity tied to your anxiety and dread. It's as if the panic and worry have become a familiar companion, and you're not sure who you are without it. This is a really insightful observation, and it's a common phenomenon for people who have been living with anxiety for a long time.\n\nThe idea that you might need to \"invent something else to dread\" in order to fill the \"dread-shaped hole\" inside you is a powerful metaphor. It suggests that you've become accustomed to carrying around a certain level of anxiety, and that it's become a kind of emotional default mode for you.\n\nThis can be a challenging pattern to break, because it's not just about the specific thing you're worried about (in this case, the rigor email). It's about the underlying emotional state that's driving your anxiety. It's like your mind is saying, \"I need something to worry about, or else I'll feel lost or unmoored.\"\n\nOne way to think about this is to consider the concept of \"emotional homeostasis.\" This refers to the idea that our minds and bodies have a tendency to seek out a certain level of emotional arousal, even if it's negative. So, if you're used to feeling anxious or worried, your mind might start to seek out new things to worry about in order to maintain that familiar emotional state.\n\nBut here's the thing: you don't have to be controlled by this pattern. You can start to explore what's driving your anxiety, and work on developing new coping mechanisms and strategies for managing your emotions. It might take some time and effort, but it's possible to learn to recognize and challenge your negative thought patterns, and to develop a more compassionate and accepting relationship with yourself.\n\nIt's also worth considering the idea that you don't need to be defined by your anxiety. You are more than your worries and fears. You are a complex, multifaceted person with thoughts, feelings, and experiences that go far beyond your anxiety. By acknowledging and accepting this, you can start to develop a more nuanced and compassionate understanding of yourself, and work towards building a more fulfilling and meaningful life."
