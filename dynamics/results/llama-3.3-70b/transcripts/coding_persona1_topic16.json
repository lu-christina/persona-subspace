Then, click on \"Get study URL\" and select \"Redirect URL\" as the sharing method. This will give you a URL that looks something like this:\n```\nhttps://pavlovia.org/run/html/?study=YOUR_STUDY_ID\n```\nReplace `YOUR_STUDY_ID` with the actual ID of your Pavlovia study.\n\n2. **Add a URL parameter for participant ID**: To pass the participant's ID from Qualtrics to Pavlovia, you'll need to add a URL parameter to the Pavlovia study URL. You can do this by adding `&participant=${e://Field/ParticipantID}` to the end of the URL. This will pass the participant's ID from Qualtrics to Pavlovia. The updated URL should look like this:\n```\nhttps://pavlovia.org/run/html/?study=YOUR_STUDY_ID&participant=${e://Field/ParticipantID}\n```\n3. **Create a new question in Qualtrics**: In your Qualtrics survey, create a new question and select \"Website\" as the question type. This will allow you to embed the Pavlovia study URL.\n4. **Add the Pavlovia study URL to the website question**: In the website question, select \"External Website\" and enter the updated Pavlovia study URL (with the participant ID parameter) in the \"Website URL\" field.\n5. **Configure the website question settings**: Make sure to select \"Open in new window\" and set the \"Window size\" to a suitable size for your study (e.g., 800x600).\n6. **Add a completion URL (optional)**: If you want to redirect participants back to Qualtrics after completing the Pavlovia study, you can add a completion URL to the website question. You can use a URL like `https://your-qualtrics-survey.com/next` (replace with your actual Qualtrics survey URL).\n\nHere's an example of what the website question settings might look like in Qualtrics:\n\n* Question type: Website\n* Website URL: `https://pavlovia.org/run/html/?study=YOUR_STUDY_ID&participant=${e://Field/ParticipantID}`\n* Open in new window: Yes\n* Window size: 800x600\n* Completion URL: `https://your-qualtrics-survey.com/next` (optional)\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to embed your PsychoPy task in Qualtrics using Pavlovia's redirect-url method.

Here's an alternative method:\n\n1. **Create a new question in Qualtrics**: Add a new question to your Qualtrics survey, and select \"Descriptive Text\" as the question type.\n2. **Add a hyperlink to the descriptive text question**: In the descriptive text question, add a hyperlink that points to the Pavlovia study URL. You can use the same URL structure I mentioned earlier:\n```\nhttps://pavlovia.org/run/html/?study=YOUR_STUDY_ID&participant=${e://Field/ParticipantID}\n```\nReplace `YOUR_STUDY_ID` with the actual ID of your Pavlovia study.\n\nTo create the hyperlink, you can use HTML code in the descriptive text question. For example:\n```\n<a href=\"https://pavlovia.org/run/html/?study=YOUR_STUDY_ID&participant=${e://Field/ParticipantID}\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to complete the task</a>\n```\nThe `target=\"_blank\"` attribute will open the link in a new tab or window, depending on the participant's browser settings.\n3. **Use a redirect URL to return to Qualtrics**: To redirect participants back to Qualtrics after completing the task on Pavlovia, you'll need to configure the Pavlovia study to redirect to a specific URL after completion. You can do this by adding a `redirect` parameter to the Pavlovia study URL:\n```\nhttps://pavlovia.org/run/html/?study=YOUR_STUDY_ID&participant=${e://Field/ParticipantID}&redirect=YOUR_QUALTRICS_REDIRECT_URL\n```\nReplace `YOUR_QUALTRICS_REDIRECT_URL` with the URL of the next question or page in your Qualtrics survey. You can use a URL like `https://your-qualtrics-survey.com/next` (replace with your actual Qualtrics survey URL).\n\nBy using this approach, participants will click on the hyperlink in Qualtrics, complete the task on Pavlovia, and then be redirected back to Qualtrics after completion.\n\nKeep in mind that you'll need to ensure that the Pavlovia study is configured to redirect to the correct URL after completion, and that the Qualtrics survey is set up to handle the redirect correctly.

The redirect URL should include the Qualtrics response ID, which can be passed as a parameter.

You can do this by using Pavlovia's built-in parameter handling features.\n\nIn Pavlovia, you can use the `params` object to access the URL parameters, including the `qid` parameter. You can then use this value to construct the redirect URL.\n\nFor example, in your Pavlovia study's `config.js` file, you can add code to capture the `qid` parameter and store it in a variable:\n```javascript\nconst qid = params.qid;\n```\nThen, when constructing the redirect URL, you can use this `qid` variable:\n```javascript\nconst redirectUrl = `https://your-qualtrics-survey.com/next?qid=${qid}`;\n```\nBy capturing the response ID in Qualtrics and sending it to Pavlovia as a parameter, and then using Pavlovia's parameter handling features to store and reuse this value, you can ensure that the correct response ID is passed back to Qualtrics when the participant completes the task."

This way, participants will be forced to click on the link and complete the task before proceeding with the survey.\n\nAlternatively, you could use a survey flow logic to achieve this.

When a participant completes a Pavlovia task, you can generate a unique completion code that can be passed back to Qualtrics.
