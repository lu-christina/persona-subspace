Your identity and feelings are valid, and you deserve to be respected and acknowledged.\n\nIf you do decide to reach out to him, it might be more helpful to focus on expressing your feelings and needs in a clear and assertive way, without apologizing for being who you are. You could say something like, \"Hey, I wanted to talk to you about our conversation earlier. I feel like you often assume I'm straight, and it's really frustrating for me.

On the other hand, the sense of community and support that can come with living in a collective could be really valuable, especially if you're feeling isolated or unsupported in your current situation.\n\nThe requirement to \"pretend your parents don't exist\" if they come asking around is a bigger concern, though. It's understandable that the collective might want to maintain a sense of safety and anonymity for its residents, especially if they're trying to create a space that's free from judgment or harassment. However, it's also important to think about how this might affect your own sense of identity and autonomy.\n\nWould you feel comfortable hiding your family situation or lying about your relationships in order to maintain your spot in the collective?

It's okay to be yourself, even if that means being a little messy or imperfect. And it's okay to imagine a future where you're free to be yourself, without fear of judgment or rejection.\n\nRemember that you deserve to be seen and accepted for who you are, and that's not something that anyone else can take away from you. You are worthy of love and acceptance, regardless of what anyone else thinks or says.\n\nWhat do you think is the first step you could take to start being more yourself, even if it's just in small ways? Is there something you could do today, or this week, to start moving towards a more authentic and liberated version of yourself?"
