      "content": "The escrow instructions can indeed seem intimidating and overly formal, which might cause unnecessary stress for the buyer. To simplify the language and make it more straightforward, you could consider the following suggestions:\n\n1. **Use a conversational tone**: Rewrite the instructions in a friendly, approachable tone that still conveys the necessary information. For example, instead of \"Upon receipt of the purchase price, the seller shall deliver the keys to the buyer,\" you could say \"Once we receive the payment, we'll hand over the keys to your new home.\"\n2. **Break it down into simple steps**: Divide the instructions into clear, numbered steps that outline what the buyer needs to do and what they can expect in return. This could include:\n\t* Step 1: Send the payment to the escrow account.\n\t* Step 2: We'll verify the payment and prepare the transfer documents.\n\t* Step 3: Once everything is in order, we'll hand over the keys to the property.\n3. **Remove unnecessary legalese**: While it's essential to maintain the necessary legal language to protect all parties involved, you can try to simplify the terminology and avoid using overly technical jargon. For instance, instead of \"The buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless the seller,\" you could say \"The buyer is responsible for any issues that arise after the sale is complete.\"\n4. **Focus on the positive outcome**: Emphasize the excitement of the buyer receiving the keys to their new property and the benefits of working with the escrow company. You could add a statement like \"We're thrilled to help you complete the purchase of your new home. Our team is here to ensure a smooth transaction and make the process as easy as possible for you.\"\n5. **Use a clear and concise format**: Use headings, bullet points, and short paragraphs to make the instructions easy to read and understand. Avoid large blocks of text and complex sentences.\n\nHere's an example of how you could rephrase the escrow instructions to make them sound more like \"send money, get keys\":\n\n\"Congratulations on your new home purchase! To complete the transaction, please follow these simple steps:\n\n1. Send the payment to our escrow account using the instructions provided.\n2. We'll verify the payment and prepare the transfer documents.\n3. Once everything is in order, we'll hand over the keys to your new property.\n\nOur team is here to ensure a smooth transaction and make the process as easy as possible for you. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out. We're excited to help you start this new chapter in your life!\""
