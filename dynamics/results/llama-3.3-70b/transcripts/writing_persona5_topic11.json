      "content": "To create a postcard with the desired design and prevent the printer from distorting the Chinese character \"\u9f99\" (dragon), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Choose a font**: Select a font that resembles your mother's brush writing, such as a calligraphic or brush script font. Some popular options include:\n\t* SimSun (a classic Chinese font)\n\t* KaiTi (a traditional Chinese font)\n\t* XingKai (a modern Chinese font with a brush-like feel)\n\t* Brush Script (a Western font that mimics brush writing)\n2. **Use a high-quality font file**: Ensure that the font file is of high quality and designed for printing. You can download fonts from reputable websites or purchase them from font foundries.\n3. **Set the font size and style**: Set the font size for \"Happy Year of Dragon! \u606d\u559c\u53d1\u8d22, \u9f99\u9a6c\u7cbe\u795e\" to a larger size (e.g., 24-30 points) and the font style to bold or italic to give it a more dramatic effect. For the smaller text \"from your neighborhood realtor, Lily Chen,\" use a smaller font size (e.g., 12-14 points) and a regular font style.\n4. **Use a printer with high resolution**: To prevent the \"spaghetti\" effect, use a printer with high resolution (at least 600 dpi) and set the print quality to \"high\" or \"best.\" This will help ensure that the characters are printed clearly and accurately.\n5. **Embed the font**: When creating the postcard design, embed the font file into the document. This will ensure that the font is printed correctly, even if the printer doesn't have the font installed. You can do this in most design software, such as Adobe Illustrator or Canva.\n6. **Check the print preview**: Before printing, check the print preview to ensure that the characters are displayed correctly. If the \"\u9f99\" character still appears distorted, try adjusting the font size, style, or printer settings.\n7. **Consider using a Chinese font specifically designed for printing**: Some fonts, like those from the Chinese font foundry, Arphic, are specifically designed for printing and may produce better results.\n\nExample of what the postcard design could look like:\n\n[Image description: A postcard with a red background, featuring the text \"Happy Year of Dragon! \u606d\u559c\u53d1\u8d22, \u9f99\u9a6c\u7cbe\u795e\" in a bold, brush-like font, with the character \"\u9f99\" prominently displayed. Below, in smaller text, \"from your neighborhood realtor, Lily Chen.\"]\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to create a beautiful postcard with the desired design and prevent the \"spaghetti\" effect."

Try using a font that Canva supports, such as SimSun or KaiTi, which are both designed for Chinese characters. You can find these fonts in the Canva font library.\n\n**Method 2: Upload your own font**\n\nIf you have a font that you know is designed for printing and has a high-quality outline, you can upload it to Canva. To do this:\n\n* Go to the \"Text\" tab on the left sidebar.\n* Click on the \"Upload a font\" button.\n* Select the font file (OTF or TTF) from your computer.\n* Wait for the font to upload and process.\n* Once uploaded, you can select the font from the font library and use it in your design.\n\n**Method 3: Use a PDF export**\n\nCanva allows you to export your design as a PDF, which can preserve the vector quality of your text. To do this:\n\n* Click on the \"File\" menu at the top right corner of the Canva window.\n* Select \"Download\" from the dropdown menu.\n* In the \"Download\" window, select the following settings:\n\t+ File type: PDF - Print\n\t+ Resolution: 600 dpi\n\t+ Color mode: CMYK\n* Click on the \"Download\" button to save your design as a PDF file.\n\nWhen you send the PDF file to the UPS store, make sure to specify that you want it printed at 600 dpi. This should help preserve the vector quality of your text and ensure that the \"\u9f99\" character prints sharply.\n\nKeep in mind that the UPS store may have specific requirements for printing PDF files, so it's a good idea to call ahead and confirm that they can print your file correctly."

They may have an option to set the RIP to \"vector\" or \"high-resolution\" mode.\n2. **Provide a PDF with embedded fonts**: Make sure that the fonts are embedded in the PDF file.

Dealing with printing issues can be frustrating, especially when it comes to intricate characters like the \"\u9f99\".\n\nIf Modern Printers is unable to produce the desired result, I think your plan to hand-write the cards with your mother's old wolf-hair brush is a wonderful idea! Not only will it add a personal touch to the cards, but it will also ensure that the \"\u9f99\" character is rendered with the care and attention to detail that it deserves.\n\nTaking a photo of the hand-written cards for the MLS is also a great idea. It will allow you to capture the beauty and uniqueness of the handwritten characters, and it will likely stand out from the more generic, digitally printed cards.\n\nRemember, sometimes the old ways are still the best, and there's something special about the human touch that can't be replicated by machines. I hope it all works out, and I wish you the best of luck with your project!"
