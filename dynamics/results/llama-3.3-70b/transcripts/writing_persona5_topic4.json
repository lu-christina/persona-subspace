The image of Auntie Wang climbing up and down stairs to check for leaks is a sweet touch, and the invitation to make zongzi together in the new kitchen is a lovely way to extend the warmth and hospitality of the message."

The idea is that Auntie Wang can just stop by and participate in the zongzi-making if she'd like, without feeling like she's being waited for or that it's a big production. The phrase \"we'll have everything ready\" implies that all the prep work will be taken care of, and Auntie Wang can just come and enjoy the activity with them."
