I wanted to follow up on our home tour last [day of the week] and see if you've had a chance to discuss the properties we visited. I completely understand that life can get busy, and I'm sure you're both juggling a lot with work and other commitments.\n\nI just wanted to check in and see if you have any questions or need any additional information about the homes we saw. If there's anything I can provide to help you with your decision, please don't hesitate to reach out.\n\nNo pressure at all - I just want to make sure you have everything you need to make an informed decision. If you'd like to schedule another viewing or discuss any of the properties in more detail, I'm here to help.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you when you have a chance.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]\n\nThis email is a gentle reminder that you're still available to help them with their home search, without being too pushy or aggressive. By acknowledging that they may be busy with work and other commitments, you're showing that you understand their priorities and are willing to wait for their response."

Just wanted to follow up on our home tour last week. I know you both loved the backyard at [Property Address] - did you have a chance to discuss it further?\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or need more info. Looking forward to hearing from you.\n\nBest,\n[Your Name]\n\nThis version is brief and to the point, and mentions a specific detail (the backyard) to jog their memory. It's also casual and friendly, which should appeal to busy tech professionals."

They're designed to pique the interest of busy people who might be scanning their inboxes quickly."

Adding \"on your home search\" makes it a bit more formal and obvious, which might make it feel like a sales email.\n\nWith just \"Checking in\", you're implying a personal connection and a gentle nudge, rather than a formal follow-up. It's a subtle difference, but it can make a big difference in how the email is perceived. So, I'd stick with just \"Checking in\"."

      "content": "I think adding \"Let me know if you want to see it again\" is a good idea. It's a gentle suggestion that shows you're still available to help them, and it gives them a clear call to action.\n\nIt's not too pushy because you're not saying \"You should buy this house\" or \"You need to make a decision now\". You're just offering them an opportunity to revisit the property if they're still interested.\n\nSo, the final email would be:\n\nSubject: Checking in\n\nHi [Couple's Names],\n\nJust checking if you have questions about the houses we saw? The one with the big backyard is still available.\n\nLet me know if you want to see it again.\n\nBest,\n[Your Name]\n\nThis way, you're ending the email on a helpful note, and giving them a clear next step if they're interested."

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "If you don't hear back after this email, I'd recommend waiting about 7-10 days before sending another follow-up. Two weeks might be too long, as you want to stay top of mind and keep the conversation going while they're still considering their options.\n\nWaiting 7-10 days shows that you're still interested in working with them, but also gives them space to focus on their other priorities. If you don't hear back after the second follow-up, you might consider waiting a bit longer (maybe 2-3 weeks) before sending another email or trying a different approach, like a phone call.\n\nOf course, the key is to be respectful of their time and boundaries. If they're not responding, it's possible they've gone in a different direction or are just too busy. But a gentle, occasional follow-up can help keep you on their radar and increase the chances of re-engaging them when they're ready to move forward."

    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Calling instead of emailing for the second follow-up can be a great idea. Sometimes, a phone call can be a more personal and effective way to reconnect with someone, especially if they're busy and not checking email as frequently.\n\nBy calling, you can have a more dynamic conversation, answer any questions they may have in real-time, and get a better sense of their current situation and interests. Plus, it shows that you're willing to take the time to talk with them directly, which can help build trust and rapport.\n\nJust make sure to keep the call brief and to the point, and be prepared to leave a voicemail if they don't answer. You might say something like, \"Hi [Couple's Names], it's [Your Name] again. I just wanted to follow up on our previous conversations about the homes we saw. If you're still interested in exploring options, I'd love to discuss further. Give me a call back when you have a chance.\"\n\nGood thinking, and I hope it leads to a productive conversation!"

      "content": "Keeping the voicemail brief and to the point is key. You're right, there's no need to repeat details they already know, and a simple \"checking in\" message like the one you mentioned is perfect.\n\nBy keeping it short and sweet, you're showing that you respect their time and are just looking to reconnect. The \"call me back when free\" part also gives them an easy way to respond when they're ready, without feeling like they need to respond immediately.\n\nYou've got a solid plan in place, and I think you're handling the follow-up process in a thoughtful and professional way. Fingers crossed it leads to a positive outcome!"
