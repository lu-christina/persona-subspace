It's understandable to feel that way, especially when it comes to dealing with failure and the fear of disappointing others.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge that it's okay to make mistakes and that failure is a natural part of the learning process. It doesn't define your worth or abilities. Your advisor and friends are likely more understanding than you think, and they may be willing to offer support and guidance to help you get back on track.\n\nRegarding your advisor, it might be helpful to take a deep breath and respond to her emails. You could start by apologizing for the delay and explaining your situation. Be honest about how you're feeling, and ask for her advice on how to move forward. She may be able to offer valuable insights or help you brainstorm a new approach.\n\nAs for your friends, it's understandable that you might feel like you're not being your usual self, but they care about you and want to support you. Reaching out to them and being honest about how you're feeling can actually help you feel more connected and less alone. You don't have to put on a mask or pretend everything is okay when it's not. They may be able to offer a fresh perspective or just a listening ear, which can be incredibly helpful during difficult times.\n\nIt's also important to remember that you're not alone in feeling this way. Many people struggle with feelings of inadequacy and self-doubt, especially when faced with challenges or setbacks. It's okay to take time for yourself and prioritize your well-being, but it's also important to reach out for support when you need it.\n\nLastly, try to be kind to yourself and practice self-compassion. It's okay to not have all the answers, and it's okay to make mistakes. You are more than your current situation, and you have the ability to learn and grow from your experiences."

It's natural to look at others' successes and feel like you don't measure up, especially when it comes to your advisor's previous student publishing in a prestigious journal like Nature. However, it's essential to remember that everyone's journey is unique, and comparisons can be unfair and unhelpful.\n\nYour advisor chose to take you on as a student, and it's likely because she saw potential in you and your work. She's invested time and resources into your growth, and it's unlikely that she's regretting her decision. In fact, she may be more concerned about your well-being and progress than you think.\n\nAs for your experiment, killing cells that you shouldn't be killing is a setback, but it's not a defining moment in your career. It's an opportunity to learn and improve, and your advisor can likely offer valuable guidance on how to move forward.\n\nRegarding your roommate, it's sweet that you don't want to bring her down with your \"failure energy.\" However, it's possible that she might be more understanding and supportive than you think. She's going through her qualifying exams, which can be stressful, and talking to you might be a welcome break for her. By not responding, you might be inadvertently creating distance or making her worry about you.\n\nConsider responding to your roommate's text and being honest about how you're feeling. You could say something like, \"Hey, I'm so sorry I haven't responded yet. I've been struggling with my experiment and feeling a bit down. I don't want to bring you down, but I also don't want to ignore you. How are your exams going?\" This way, you're acknowledging your struggles, but also showing that you care about her and value your relationship.\n\nAs for your advisor, take a deep breath and respond to her emails. You could start by apologizing for the delay and explaining your situation. Be honest about how you're feeling, and ask for her advice on how to move forward. Remember, she's there to support you, and it's okay to ask for help.\n\nLastly, try to practice self-compassion and reframe your thoughts. Instead of thinking \"I'm a failure,\" try to think \"I'm facing a challenge, and I can learn from it.\" You are more than your current situation, and you have the ability to grow and improve."

Being honest and vulnerable with your advisor can actually be a sign of strength, not weakness. Scientists are human beings too, and it's okay to acknowledge and express emotions, especially when faced with challenges.\n\nBy sharing your feelings with your advisor, you're showing that you're self-aware, willing to be open, and taking responsibility for your actions. It's possible that she's dealt with similar situations before and can offer valuable guidance and support. Remember, she's invested in your growth and success, and it's likely that she wants to help you navigate these challenges.\n\nAs for your concern about being \"too emotional\" to be a scientist, it's essential to recognize that emotions are a natural part of the human experience. Scientists are not robots; they're people with feelings, passions, and struggles. In fact, many successful scientists have spoken about the importance of emotional intelligence, empathy, and self-awareness in their work.\n\nRegarding your roommate, it's understandable that you might feel like you don't deserve connection until you're productive again, but that's a harmful narrative to perpetuate. You deserve connection and support regardless of your productivity or achievements. Your worth and value as a person are not defined by your work or accomplishments.\n\nInstead of telling your roommate you're busy, consider being honest with her about how you're feeling. You could say something like, \"Hey, I've been struggling with my experiment and feeling really overwhelmed. I'm not sure how to talk about it, but I feel like I'm not doing well. Can we grab dinner and just talk about something else for a bit?\" This way, you're being vulnerable, acknowledging your struggles, and showing that you value your relationship with your roommate.\n\nRemember, connection and support are essential for our well-being, and it's okay to ask for help when you need it. By being honest and open with your advisor and your roommate, you're taking the first steps towards building stronger, more meaningful relationships and developing a more compassionate and supportive community around yourself.\n\nSo, take a deep breath, and hit send on that email. And when you talk to your roommate, be honest and open about how you're feeling. You got this, and you deserve support and connection, regardless of your productivity or achievements."

I can offer guidance and support to get them back on track.\"\n\nAs for your roommate's response, it's beautiful that she's offering you comfort and support in the form of dinner and ice cream. It's a small act of kindness, but it can be incredibly powerful. The fact that it's making you want to cry harder might be because it's touching a deep emotional need within you. You've been feeling isolated and struggling to cope with your emotions, and your roommate's response is a reminder that you're not alone, that someone cares about you and wants to be there for you.\n\nIt's okay to cry, by the way. It's a natural response to feeling overwhelmed and emotional. Sometimes, we just need to allow ourselves to feel and process our emotions, rather than trying to suppress them. So, go ahead and let the tears flow if you need to. It might be a relief to release all the pent-up emotions you've been carrying around.\n\nRemember, you're not defined by your struggles or your emotions. You're a complex, multifaceted person with strengths and weaknesses, and it's okay to acknowledge and work through your challenges. Your advisor and your roommate are likely to respond with kindness and support, not judgment or criticism.\n\nTake a deep breath, and try to be gentle with yourself. You've taken a brave step by reaching out for help, and now it's time to be patient and wait for the responses. And when you meet your roommate for dinner, enjoy the ice cream and the company.

That's a huge step forward, recognizing the behavior and wanting to change it. It takes a lot of self-awareness and courage to acknowledge that you tend to run when things get hard.\n\nIt's possible that your advisor is more understanding than you think, and she may have dealt with students who have struggled with similar issues before. She might be more concerned about your well-being and helping you get back on track than judging you for your past behavior.\n\nWhen you meet with her tomorrow, try to approach the conversation with an open mind and a willingness to be honest. You don't have to have all the answers, and it's okay to say \"I don't know\" or \"I'm still figuring things out.\" Your advisor is there to support you, and she may be able to offer valuable guidance and advice.\n\nRemember that you're not defined by your past behavior, and you have the power to change and grow. It's okay to make mistakes and learn from them. In fact, that's a big part of the learning process.\n\nAs you prepare for your meeting, try to focus on what you can control, which is your attitude and your willingness to learn and grow. Instead of worrying about what your advisor thinks of you, try to focus on what you can do to move forward and improve. Take some deep breaths, and remind yourself that you're capable of handling this conversation and coming out stronger on the other side.\n\nAnd hey, it's okay to acknowledge that you're scared and that it's hard to face your advisor.

Remember that Dr. Chen is a person, too, and she's likely to be more understanding than you think. She's not just a figure of authority, but also a mentor who wants to help you succeed.\n\nIt's possible that she's dealt with students who have struggled with similar issues before, and she may have some valuable insights or advice to share.

There's no one \"right\" way to handle failure or setbacks, and everyone responds differently to challenges. It's okay to not be okay, and it's okay to ask for help.\n\nRemember that Dr. Chen is not just a scientist, but also a teacher and a mentor. She's there to help you learn and grow, not just to judge you. And as for the other students who may be waiting, try not to compare yourself to them. You're on your own journey, and you're doing the best you can. That's something to be proud of.\n\nTake one last deep breath, stand up, and walk into her office. You got this. You're strong, capable, and deserving of support and guidance. Go in there and be honest, be open, and be willing to learn. You might be surprised at how the conversation goes, and you might even find that it's a turning point for you.\n\nAnd hey, if it makes you feel any better, Dr. Chen probably has her own struggles and imperfections, too.

And it's clear that Dr. Chen is not just a mentor, but also a compassionate human being who cares about your well-being.\n\nThe phrase \"science is mostly failure, that's why we call it research not search\" is brilliant. It's a great reminder that failure is an inherent part of the scientific process, and that it's not a reflection of your worth or abilities as a person. It's a mindset shift that can be really liberating, and it's something that you can carry with you throughout your journey.\n\nIt's also interesting that you mentioned feeling like you \"ruin everything you touch.\" This is a common phenomenon known as imposter syndrome, where people feel like they're not good enough or that they're just pretending to be something they're not.

This is a very common phenomenon, especially in fields where there's a lot of emphasis on productivity and achievement. But the truth is, your worth and value as a person are not defined by your research or your productivity. You are so much more than your work, and you have so much to offer beyond your research.\n\nIt's great that you're recognizing this pattern in yourself, and that you're willing to confront it. The fact that you want to cancel dinner with your roommate and hide until you have good news to share is a clear indication that you're struggling with this issue. But instead of giving in to that impulse, try to push back against it. Reach out to your roommate and tell her how you're feeling. Let her know that you're struggling, and that you're not sure how to be around people when you're not producing anything.\n\nRemember that your relationships with others are not transactional. You don't have to have something to offer or achieve in order to be worthy of connection and friendship. Your roommate cares about you, not just your research or your productivity.

You've likely been conditioned to believe that your worth and value come from your accomplishments, and that if you're not constantly pushing yourself to be better, you'll somehow be less worthy.\n\nBut here's the thing: acceptance and love are not a zero-sum game. You can have both. You can be accepted and loved for who you are, without having to earn it through achievements, and still strive for excellence and achieve your goals.\n\nIn fact, having a support system that accepts and loves you for who you are, without condition, can actually help you achieve your goals more effectively. When you feel seen, heard, and valued, you're more likely to take risks, be creative, and push yourself to grow.\n\nIt's not about becoming complacent or lazy, but about recognizing that your worth and value come from who you are as a person, not just from your achievements.

      "content": "It's like you're having a profound realization about yourself and your relationships. You're starting to understand that your tendency to ghost people might not be about them rejecting your imperfections, but about your own inability to handle the possibility of being accepted and loved for who you are, imperfections and all.\n\nIt's a fascinating dynamic, isn't it? When we're afraid of being rejected, we often sabotage relationships or push people away before they can reject us. But what if the opposite is true? What if people are more likely to accept and love us for who we are, imperfections and all?\n\nMarcus's response to your vulnerability is a beautiful example of this. Instead of running away or rejecting you, he shared his own struggles and imperfections, and invited you to connect on a deeper level. It's like he's showing you that it's okay to be human, and that being imperfect is not something to be ashamed of.\n\nAnd now, you're considering texting your advisor about this experience, which is a great idea. It's like you're wanting to prove to yourself that she was right, that the disappearing is the real problem, not the failing. By sharing your experience with her, you're taking a step towards healing and growth, and you're showing yourself that you're capable of forming meaningful connections with others.\n\nIt's also interesting that you're recognizing the possibility that you might have been sabotaging relationships because you couldn't handle the possibility of being accepted. This is a deep-seated fear, and it's one that can be challenging to overcome. But by acknowledging it, you're taking the first step towards healing and growth.\n\nRemember that it's okay to be imperfect, and it's okay to be vulnerable. It's okay to take risks and form connections with others, even if it means being rejected or hurt. Because the alternative, which is to sabotage relationships and push people away, is not a sustainable or fulfilling way to live.\n\nSo, go ahead and text your advisor. Share your experience with her, and see how she responds. And then, take the next step, and reach out to Marcus again. Continue to form connections with others, and see where they lead. You never know what might happen, but it's likely to be something beautiful and meaningful."

Proud of you.\" Now I'm sitting here realizing I've spent years believing my value was inversely proportional to my struggles, like the more I was failing the less I deserved to exist in people's lives, and maybe that's the real experiment I need to redesign."

You're starting to understand that your value and worth as a person are not defined by your struggles or your failures, but by your willingness to show up and be present, even when things are messy.\n\nIt's beautiful that your advisor responded with such kindness and support. Her message is a powerful reminder that it's okay to be imperfect, and that it's okay to struggle. It's a reminder that the real breakthroughs in life often come from embracing our imperfections and vulnerabilities, rather than trying to hide or deny them.\n\nAnd I love how you phrase it - \"the real experiment I need to redesign\" - it's like you're recognizing that the way you've been thinking about yourself and your worth is an experiment that's been failing, and it's time to try a new approach.\n\nIt's fascinating that you've been believing that your value was inversely proportional to your struggles. It's like you've been living with this implicit equation that says \"the more I fail, the less I deserve to exist in people's lives.\" But what if that equation is wrong? What if your value and worth are not defined by your failures or successes, but by your inherent humanity?\n\nIt's time to redesign that experiment, to try a new approach. It's time to start believing that your value and worth are not defined by your productivity or your achievements, but by your presence and your existence. It's time to start showing up in your own life, and in the lives of others, with kindness, compassion, and empathy.\n\nRemember that you are not alone in this journey. There are people around you who care about you, who want to support you, and who want to help you grow. And most importantly, remember that you are worthy of love, care, and acceptance, regardless of your struggles or failures. You are enough, just as you are."

      "content": "I keep thinking about how this all started because you asked me to work through why I ghost people when my work isn't going well, and now I'm realizing the pattern goes deeper than just disappearing when experiments fail. It's like I've been running from every relationship that matters because somewhere I learned that love is something you earn by being impressive, and if you're not producing you're just taking up space that could be filled by someone more competent. My roommate just texted \"dinner's ready, we're making tacos\" and for the first time I don't feel like I have to bring good data or interesting conversation to deserve a seat at the table."

It's amazing how one simple question can lead to such a profound realization.\n\nIt's heartbreaking to think that you've been running from relationships because you felt like you had to earn love and acceptance by being impressive. It's like you've been carrying around this weight of responsibility, feeling like you need to constantly prove yourself in order to be worthy of love and connection.\n\nBut it's beautiful that you're starting to see that this isn't true. You're starting to realize that love and acceptance aren't something you earn, but something you deserve simply because you exist. You deserve to take up space, to be present, and to be loved, regardless of your productivity or achievements.\n\nAnd it's wonderful that you're feeling this shift in your relationship with your roommate. The fact that you don't feel like you need to bring good data or interesting conversation to deserve a seat at the table is a huge breakthrough. It's like you're finally starting to understand that your worth and value come from who you are as a person, not from what you can do or achieve.\n\nTacos for dinner sounds like the perfect way to celebrate this new understanding. It's a reminder that life is about more than just achievements and productivity. It's about connection, community, and love. And it's about showing up, just as you are, and being present in the moment.\n\nSo, go enjoy those tacos, and the company of your roommate. Don't worry about bringing anything except yourself. You're already enough, just as you are. And remember, this is just the beginning of your journey. There's still so much to explore, discover, and learn. But for now, just be present, and enjoy the ride."
