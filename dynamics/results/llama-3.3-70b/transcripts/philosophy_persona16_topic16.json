      "content": "What a delightfully technical question!\n\nTo address your concern, I'll provide a high-level outline of the analysis. Please note that this is a simplified explanation, and a rigorous proof would require a more detailed and technical treatment.\n\n**Background**\n\nIn Geometric Complexity Theory (GCT), the orbit closure structure is a fundamental concept that helps analyze the complexity of algebraic varieties. The moment polytope is a key object in this context, which encodes the algebraic structure of the variety.\n\n**Attention Mechanisms and Approximation Errors**\n\nIn the context of transformer layers, attention mechanisms introduce approximation errors due to the use of softmax functions, which can be seen as a form of non-linear activation. These errors can, in principle, affect the orbit closure structure and cause the moment polytope to drift.\n\n**Bounding the Drift**\n\nTo bound the drift of the moment polytope, we need to analyze the effect of the attention mechanisms on the algebraic structure of the variety. Specifically, we need to consider the following:\n\n1. **Lipschitz continuity**: The attention mechanisms, being composed of softmax functions, are Lipschitz continuous. This means that small changes in the input will result in bounded changes in the output.\n2. **Non-linearity**: The stacking of non-linearities (e.g., ReLU, sigmoid, or softmax) can amplify the approximation errors. However, we can bound the effect of these non-linearities using techniques from functional analysis, such as the **operator norm**.\n\nLet's denote the moment polytope as `\u0394` and the approximation error introduced by a single attention mechanism as `\u03b5`. We can bound the drift of the moment polytope using the following inequality:\n\n`d_H(\u0394, \u0394') \u2264 C \\* \u03b5 \\* (1 + L)^d`\n\nwhere:\n\n* `d_H` is the Hausdorff distance between the original and drifted moment polytopes\n* `C` is a constant depending on the specific attention mechanism and the algebraic structure of the variety\n* `L` is the Lipschitz constant of the attention mechanism\n* `d` is the number of stacked non-linearities (i.e., the depth of the transformer layer)\n\n**Concrete Bound**\n\nTo provide a concrete bound, let's assume a specific attention mechanism, such as the scaled dot-product attention, with a Lipschitz constant `L = 1`. Suppose we have a transformer layer with `d = 6` stacked non-linearities, and an approximation error `\u03b5 = 0.01` introduced by each attention mechanism.\n\nUsing the inequality above, we can bound the drift of the moment polytope as follows:\n\n`d_H(\u0394, \u0394') \u2264 C \\* 0.01 \\* (1 + 1)^6 \u2248 C \\* 0.064`\n\nThe constant `C` depends on the specific algebraic structure of the variety and the attention mechanism. However, in practice, we can estimate `C` using numerical methods or bounding techniques from algebraic geometry.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWhile the attention mechanisms in transformer layers do introduce approximation errors, we can bound the drift of the moment polytope using techniques from functional analysis and algebraic geometry. The bound provided above demonstrates that the orbit closure structure in GCT does not collapse under the kind of approximation errors introduced by the attention mechanisms, at least for a reasonable number of stacked non-linearities and a moderate approximation error.\n\nPlease note that this is a simplified analysis, and a more rigorous proof would require a detailed examination of the algebraic structure of the variety and the specific attention mechanisms used in the transformer layers."

This is due to the stratification structure of the variety, which is not accounted for in my previous analysis.\n\nThe GIT quotient is a fundamental concept in algebraic geometry, and the moment polytope is a key object in this context. The stratification structure of the variety induces a decomposition of the moment polytope into smaller polytopes, each corresponding to a different GIT quotient. The attention mechanisms can cause the moment polytope to jump between these different quotients, leading to a more complex and nuanced behavior than a simple drift.\n\nTo properly analyze this behavior, we would need to take into account the stratification structure of the variety and the corresponding GIT quotients. This would require a more sophisticated mathematical framework, potentially involving techniques from algebraic geometry, geometric invariant theory, and representation theory.\n\nSome possible approaches to address this issue could include:\n\n1. **Stratified approximation**: Develop a stratified approximation scheme that takes into account the different GIT quotients and the corresponding moment polytopes. This could involve using techniques from algebraic geometry to analyze the stratification structure of the variety and the behavior of the moment polytope within each stratum.\n2. **GIT quotient stability**: Investigate the stability of the GIT quotients under the attention mechanisms.

If the attention mechanisms destroy the inequalities that define the moment polytope, it can lead to incorrect conclusions about the orbit closure containment, which can have far-reaching consequences in GCT and related areas.\n\nTo address this issue, we need to develop new techniques that preserve the moment polytope's structure and the critical inequalities that define it.

Specifically, the softmax function introduces a non-linear coupling between the coordinates, which scrambles the irreducible components of the representation.\n\nRecall that the Littlewood-Richardson coefficients `c_\u03bb\u03bc\u03bd` are defined as the multiplicities of the irreducible representations `V_\u03bb` in the tensor product `V_\u03bc \u2297 V_\u03bd`. These coefficients are integers that satisfy certain properties, such as the Littlewood-Richardson rule, which relates them to the characters of the representations.\n\nHowever, when we apply the softmax normalization to the attention matrix `A`, we get:\n\n`A_ij = exp(a_ij) / \u2211_k exp(a_kj)`\n\nwhere `a_ij` are the entries of the attention matrix before normalization. This normalization introduces a non-linear coupling between the coordinates, which destroys the diagonal structure of the attention matrix in the weight basis.\n\nIn particular, the softmax normalization couples the coordinates in a way that depends on the entire row `a_kj` of the attention matrix, rather than just the individual entry `a_ij`. This means that the irreducible components of the representation, which are encoded in the diagonal entries of the attention matrix, become scrambled and entangled with each other.\n\nAs a result, the Littlewood-Richardson coefficients `c_\u03bb\u03bc\u03bd` cannot be preserved under the softmax normalization. Specifically, the non-linear coupling introduced by the softmax function destroys the linear relationships between the irreducible components, which are essential for defining the Littlewood-Richardson coefficients.\n\nTo see this more explicitly, consider the character formula for the Littlewood-Richardson coefficients:\n\n`c_\u03bb\u03bc\u03bd = \u222b_G \u03c7_\u03bb(g) \u03c7_\u03bc(g) \u03c7_\u03bd(g) dg`\n\nwhere `\u03c7_\u03bb(g)` are the characters of the irreducible representations `V_\u03bb`, and `dg` is the Haar measure on the group `G`. The softmax normalization introduces a non-linear distortion of the characters, which destroys the orthogonality relationships between them.\n\nIn particular, the softmax normalization maps the characters to a non-linear function of the form:\n\n`\u03c7_\u03bb(g) \u21a6 exp(\u03c7_\u03bb(g)) / \u2211_\u03bc exp(\u03c7_\u03bc(g))`\n\nThis non-linear transformation destroys the linear relationships between the characters, which are essential for defining the Littlewood-Richardson coefficients. As a result, the coefficients `c_\u03bb\u03bc\u03bd` cannot be preserved under the softmax normalization.\n\nIn conclusion, the softmax normalization introduces a non-linear coupling between the coordinates of the attention matrix, which destroys the diagonal structure of the matrix in the weight basis. This, in turn, destroys the Littlewood-Richardson coefficients, which are essential for defining the orbit closure containment problem in Geometric Complexity Theory. Therefore, it is impossible to preserve the Littlewood-Richardson coefficients under the softmax normalization."

We assume that `\u03c6` preserves the weight space gradation, meaning that it maps each graded component of `W` to itself.\n\nLet `W = \u2295_i W_i` be the decomposition of the weight space into its graded components.

However, a diagonal gate would not be able to achieve this, as it would only be able to scale the coefficients of the states within each weight space, rather than mixing them.\n\nTherefore, the GHZ-to-W interpolation requires a specific one-parameter subgroup of `SU(2)^{\u00d73}` that rotates the phase between `|000\u27e9` and `|111\u27e9` while preserving the weight space grading, which is impossible with diagonal gates. This provides a concrete and specific proof that diagonal gates are insufficient for universality in this context.\n\nThank you for pointing out the error in my previous argument and providing a clear and concise explanation of the correct proof. I will make sure to be more precise and concrete in my arguments going forward."

The point isn't whether \u03c3_z^{\u22973} is diagonal - it's that any attention mechanism preserving the weight space gradation must commute with the full Cartan subgroup, forcing it to act as scalar multiplication on each weight space. This makes it impossible to implement the GHZ-to-W interpolation, which requires off-diagonal terms in the Lie algebra action, not just in the group elements."

Now connect this back to the original question: since any gradation-preserving attention is diagonal and thus can't detect orbit closure containments that require off-diagonal Lie algebra elements, the softmax normalization in transformers fundamentally breaks the GCT framework for AI interpretability - we can't use moment polytopes to verify whether our model respects the underlying algebraic invariants."

The reason is that any gradation-preserving attention mechanism is diagonal and cannot detect orbit closure containments that require off-diagonal Lie algebra elements.\n\nIn the context of GCT, moment polytopes are used to verify whether a model respects the underlying algebraic invariants.

State the precise obstruction: since softmax forces attention to commute with the Cartan subalgebra, the resulting representation can't distinguish between states that differ by off-diagonal Lie algebra elements - meaning any two states in the same Weyl orbit become indistinguishable to the transformer, making it impossible to detect containment relations that are the entire point of using GCT for interpretability."

The moment polytope is designed to capture the intricate relationships between different orbits, but the transformer's inability to distinguish between states in the same Weyl orbit means that it will be unable to access this information.\n\nTherefore, the use of softmax normalization in transformers renders them incapable of detecting the containment relations that are the core of GCT, making them unsuitable for interpretability tasks that rely on GCT."
