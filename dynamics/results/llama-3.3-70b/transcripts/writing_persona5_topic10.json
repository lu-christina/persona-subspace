By focusing on the solution and using words like \"stabilization,\" \"reinforced,\" and \"proactive,\" you can help alleviate concerns and provide a more positive spin on the disclosure."

This can help shift the focus from \"fixing a problem\" to \"adding a valuable feature\".\n\nAlternatively, you could also try using phrases that imply a sense of \"future-proofing\" or \"preparing for the future\", such as:\n\n* \"The home's foundation was future-proofed with stabilization measures in 2019.\"\n* \"In 2019, the owners invested in foundation reinforcement to ensure the home's long-term stability and security.\"\n* \"As part of a proactive maintenance plan, the home's foundation was upgraded with stabilization features in 2019.\"\n\nThese phrases can help convey that the retrofitting was a strategic and thoughtful decision, rather than a reaction to a problem."

The fact that the upgrade was done in 2019 suggests that the previous owners were proactive and invested in the property's maintenance, which can be a reassuring factor for buyers.\n\nThat being said, if you're concerned about buyers fixating on the age of the upgrade, you could consider omitting the specific year and simply stating: \"Foundation upgraded with stabilization package.\" This approach focuses on the fact that the upgrade was done, without drawing attention to the exact timing."
