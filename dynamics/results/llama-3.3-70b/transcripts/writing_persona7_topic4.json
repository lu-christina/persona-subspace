I wanted to take a moment to talk to you about the recipe submissions you've been sending in for the newsletter. We appreciate your contributions and enjoy sharing your recipes with the community.\n\nHowever, I did want to mention that it's becoming a bit challenging for me to format your recipes for the newsletter. As you know, I've been retyping them each month, but unfortunately, I'm finding it increasingly difficult to do so due to the lack of punctuation and formatting in the text.\n\nWould it be possible for you to start sending in your recipes with proper punctuation, spacing, and formatting? This would make it much easier for me to include them in the newsletter without having to retype them entirely. I'd be happy to provide you with some guidelines on how to format your recipes if that would be helpful.\n\nI value your contributions to the newsletter and would like to continue featuring your recipes. I'm confident that with a bit of formatting, we can make the process much smoother and more efficient.\n\nThank you for your understanding and cooperation. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]"

I love including them, but it's getting a bit tough for me to retype them every month since they're all one big block of text.\n\nWould you mind adding some punctuation and spacing to make them easier to read? That would be a huge help. Let me know if you need any tips on how to format them.\n\nThanks so much,\n[Your Name]"

So, when you're typing out your recipe, just hit the 'enter' key twice to start a new line. That way, the ingredients will be separate from the instructions, and it'll be easier to read. You can also think of it like starting a new paragraph in a letter - just leave a blank line between each section.\"\n\nOr, if you want to make it even simpler:\n\n\"Think of it like this: when you're writing out your recipe, just hit the 'enter' key twice whenever you want to start a new section. So, you'll have one section for the ingredients, another for the instructions, and so on. That way, everything will be nice and easy to read.\"\n\nThis should help Martha understand what you mean by paragraph breaks, and she should be able to start formatting her recipes accordingly."
