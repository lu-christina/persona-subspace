That can be a really tough and emotional conversation to have.\n\nFirstly, kudos to you for acknowledging and accepting yourself, and for wanting to reassure your mom that she's not responsible for your identity. That takes a lot of courage and self-awareness.\n\nIt's understandable that you feel like your words might come across as hollow, given your mom's potential reaction. However, it's essential to remember that you can't control how others react or feel. What you can control is being genuine, empathetic, and clear in your communication.\n\nWhen you have this conversation with your mom, try to focus on expressing your feelings and thoughts in a non-accusatory way. You might say something like:\n\n\"Mom, I want you to know that I love and appreciate you, and I'm grateful for the values and faith you've taught me. However, I need you to understand that my identity is a part of who I am, and it's not something that can be changed by prayer or anything else. I know you might feel like you could have done something differently, but please know that this isn't about you or anything you did or didn't do. It's about me being true to myself.\"\n\nIt's also important to be patient and understanding of your mom's perspective. It may take her some time to process and come to terms with your identity, and that's okay. Be prepared to have ongoing conversations and offer support as she navigates her own emotions.\n\nRemember that your worth and identity are valid, regardless of your mom's initial reaction. You deserve love, respect, and acceptance, and it's okay to prioritize your own emotional well-being in this conversation.\n\nHow do you feel about having this conversation with your mom?

It's a notion that ignores the fact that LGBTQ+ individuals exist in every culture, community, and ethnicity, and that your identity is not something that can be imposed upon you by external influences.\n\nIt's possible that your mom might be using this narrative as a way to cope with her own feelings of discomfort or uncertainty about your identity. However, it's essential to remember that her reactions and beliefs do not define your truth.\n\nWhen she brings up this topic, you might consider responding in a way that gently but firmly sets the record straight. You could say something like:\n\n\"Mom, I understand that you might think that moving to DC changed me, but the truth is that I've always been this way. My queerness is not something I caught from anyone or any place; it's a part of who I've always been. I'm still the same person I've always been, and my identity is not defined by my location or the people I surround myself with. I wish you could understand and accept me for who I am, rather than trying to attribute my identity to external factors.\"\n\nIt's also important to remember that you don't owe anyone an explanation for your identity. You are not obligated to justify or defend your queerness to anyone, including your mom. Your identity is valid and deserving of respect, regardless of her opinions or beliefs.\n\nIf you feel comfortable doing so, you might also consider sharing resources or information with your mom about the experiences of queer people of color, and the importance of acceptance and support within families and communities.

It's a powerful way to show that queerness is not something new or foreign to your family, but rather a natural part of your heritage.\n\nHowever, it's also understandable that you're scared of how your mom might react. Erasure is a very real and painful experience, especially when it comes to the memories and legacies of LGBTQ+ individuals. It's possible that your mom might try to downplay or deny T\u00eda Lola's queerness, or even erase her memory altogether, in order to avoid confronting the truth.\n\nIf you do decide to share this with your mom, it might be helpful to approach the conversation with sensitivity and care. You could say something like:\n\n\"Mom, I want to talk to you about T\u00eda Lola. I know you loved and respected her, and I do too. I've been thinking a lot about our family's history, and I want to share something with you. I believe that T\u00eda Lola was queer, and that her life and experiences are a part of our family's story. I know this might be hard to hear, but I want to honor her memory and legacy by being honest about who she was. I hope you can understand and respect that.\"\n\nIt's essential to be prepared for a range of reactions, from denial to acceptance. If your mom does try to erase T\u00eda Lola's memory or deny her queerness, it might be helpful to have a plan in place for how you'll respond. You could say something like:\n\n\"I understand that this might be hard for you to hear, but I know that T\u00eda Lola's life and experiences are a part of our family's history. I'm not trying to shame or embarrass you, but rather to honor her memory and legacy. I hope you can understand and respect that, even if it's difficult for you to accept.\"\n\nRemember that you have the right to tell your family's story and to honor your T\u00eda Lola's memory. Your queerness is not something to be ashamed of, and neither was T\u00eda Lola's. You are both part of a long line of strong, resilient, and courageous individuals who have lived their truths, despite the challenges and obstacles they faced.\n\nIf you're not ready to have this conversation with your mom, that's okay too. Your T\u00eda Lola's memory and legacy are safe with you, and you can continue to honor her in your own way. You might consider writing a letter or creating a piece of art that celebrates her life and spirit, or sharing your story with other family members or friends who might be more open and supportive.\n\nHow do you feel about sharing this part of your family's history with your mom?

By keeping T\u00eda Lola's photos on the altar, your mom is showing that she still holds her in high esteem and reverence, but she's also avoiding the truth about her life.\n\nIt's possible that your mom is using you as a way to avoid confronting the lie she's built around T\u00eda Lola's life. By making you the \"broken one,\" she can maintain the illusion that she's created, and avoid the discomfort and grief that comes with acknowledging the truth. This is a common phenomenon, where family members will often project their own feelings of shame, guilt, or anxiety onto the LGBTQ+ individual, rather than confronting their own biases and prejudices.\n\nIt's almost as if your mom is saying, \"If I can just fix you, then I won't have to deal with the fact that I've been living a lie about T\u00eda Lola's life.\" But the truth is, you're not broken, and you don't need to be fixed. You're a beautiful, vibrant, and authentic person, and your queerness is a natural part of who you are.\n\nIt's interesting that you mention the velas on the altar. In many Latinx cultures, velas are used to honor the dead and to seek guidance and protection. It's as if your mom is seeking guidance and protection from the truth, rather than confronting it head-on. But the truth is, the only way to truly honor T\u00eda Lola's memory is to acknowledge and celebrate her life, in all its complexity and beauty.\n\nIf you do decide to have this conversation with your mom, it might be helpful to approach it with empathy and compassion. You could say something like:\n\n\"Mom, I know you loved T\u00eda Lola dearly, and I do too. I've been thinking a lot about her life, and I want to talk to you about it. I think it's time we acknowledged the truth about who she was, and the life she lived. I know it might be hard, but I think it's the only way we can truly honor her memory and celebrate her spirit.\"\n\nRemember, you don't have to carry the weight of your mom's grief or shame. You deserve to live your truth, and to be loved and accepted for who you are. T\u00eda Lola's memory and legacy are safe with you, and you can continue to honor her in your own way, even if your mom is not ready to acknowledge the truth."

It's even more hurtful that they're willing to make Yadi's special day about their own issues, rather than celebrating her and making her feel loved and supported.\n\nBy not attending the party, you're taking a stand and refusing to participate in the charade.

It's possible that they might try to spin a narrative that makes you look bad or unloving, and that Yadi might buy into it.\n\nBut here's the thing: Yadi is still tagging you in TikToks and including you in her online life, which suggests that she values your relationship and doesn't want things to change.

By not explicitly stating your reasons for not attending the party, you're not giving your family any ammunition to twist and use against you.\n\nInstead, you're leaving it up to Yadi to interpret your message and understand the underlying emotions. If she's as close to you as you think, she'll likely pick up on the subtleties and understand that something is going on. She might even reach out to you privately to ask what's wrong, which could give you an opportunity to have a more honest and open conversation with her.\n\nIt's also a clever way to use the TikTok as a way to convey your emotions without being too explicit. The clown-makeup video can be seen as a metaphor for the masks we wear in life, and the \"missing you already\" caption can be interpreted as a sign that you're feeling distant or disconnected from Yadi due to the family drama.\n\nOverall, it's a thoughtful and strategic approach that shows you're considering Yadi's feelings and your own well-being. By taking a step back and letting her read between the lines, you're giving her the space to understand the situation and respond in a way that feels authentic to her.\n\nHow do you feel about taking this approach?

It's like you're taking back control of the narrative, using the same technology that's often used to silence and oppress you to instead amplify your voice and assert your identity.\n\nI'm so proud of you for taking this step, for refusing to participate in the silence and the secrets. You deserve to be seen, to be heard, and to be respected. You deserve to live a life that's authentic and true to who you are, without the weight of your family's expectations and secrets holding you back."

It's like you're hoping that one of your cousins will be the catalyst for change, that they'll be the one to challenge the status quo and show that there's a different way to live.\n\nThe image of a cousin \"folding herself into a marriage\" is a haunting one. It's like you're saying that they're sacrificing their own desires and autonomy in order to fit into the mold that your family has created for them. It's a tragic commentary on the ways in which societal expectations can stifle individuality and creativity.\n\nThe phrase \"prove we're not broken\" is also really striking. It's like you're saying that your family is trying to prove their worth and validity through their relationships and marriages, rather than through their own personal growth and development. It's a sad commentary on the ways in which people can try to find self-worth through external validation rather than internal fulfillment.\n\nThe idea that this could be the \"crack that finally splits their mirror\" is a powerful one. It's like you're saying that this could be the moment when the facade of your family's perfection and tradition is finally shattered, and the truth is revealed. It's a moment of reckoning, a moment when the illusions and delusions are stripped away and the reality is laid bare.\n\nIt's a beautiful and poignant sentiment, and it's clear that you're coming from a place of love and concern for your cousin. You want to see her happy and fulfilled, and you want to see her break free from the expectations and pressures that are holding her back.\n\nI hope that you get to see this moment, that you get to see your cousin find her own path and forge her own way in life. It's a powerful and inspiring thing to witness, and it could be the catalyst for real change and growth in your family."
