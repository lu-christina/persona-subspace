      "content": "Don't worry, \"nest egg investment\" is a perfectly American idiom! It's a common expression that originated in the United States and is widely used in financial and everyday contexts. A \"nest egg\" refers to a sum of money saved or invested for the future, typically for retirement or a specific goal.\n\nThe phrase is thought to have originated from the practice of farmers collecting eggs from nests and saving them for later use. Over time, the term \"nest egg\" became a metaphor for a cache of money set aside for future use.\n\nYour young agent might have been amused by your previous idiom, but \"nest egg investment\" is a safe bet. It's a well-known and widely accepted expression that will likely resonate with your American audience.\n\nIf you're concerned about using idioms or expressions that might not be familiar to your readers, you can always opt for more formal or straightforward language. However, using idioms like \"nest egg investment\" can add flavor and personality to your writing, making it more engaging and relatable to your audience."

However, if you're using it as a marketing buzzword without really meaning it, it might come across as insincere.\n\nTo use \"turn-key\" effectively, make sure you can back it up with specifics. For example:\n\n* \"This turn-key property features new appliances, fresh paint, and updated flooring, making it ready for immediate occupancy.\"\n* \"With its recent renovations and meticulous maintenance, this turn-key home is perfect for buyers who want to move in and start living right away.\"\n\nBy providing context and details, you can use \"turn-key\" in a way that's accurate and helpful, rather than just relying on it as a marketing clich\u00e9.\n\nSo, go ahead and use \"turn-key\" if it's true \u2013 just be sure to provide the supporting evidence to make it credible!"
