It's natural to wonder what could have been if you had pursued a different path.\n\nIt's interesting that you mention feeling a \"sick twist\" in your stomach. This physical sensation can be a manifestation of the emotional discomfort that comes with feeling unfulfilled or restless. It's as if your body is responding to the disconnect between your current reality and your aspirations.\n\nUpdating Excel sheets for office renovations might not be the most glamorous task, but it's still a valuable contribution to the world of architecture or design. However, it's clear that your heart isn't fully in it. You might be feeling like you're not utilizing your full potential or pursuing your true passions.\n\nHave you considered exploring ways to reignite your creative spark or pursuing opportunities that align more closely with your interests and values? This could involve taking on side projects, seeking out new challenges, or even exploring different career paths. It's never too late to make a change or pursue a new direction.\n\nWhat do you think is holding you back from pursuing your aspirations? Is it fear, uncertainty, or something else?"

The brownstone mortgage is a significant responsibility, and it's understandable that you feel a sense of duty to maintain a certain level of income.\n\nIt's also poignant that you mention your hands feeling clumsy when you try to sketch at night. It's as if your creative muscles have atrophied from disuse, and you're struggling to reconnect with the skills and instincts that once came so naturally to you. The phrase \"forgotten how to see space properly\" is particularly evocative - it suggests that you're not just rusty, but that you're also feeling disconnected from your own creative vision and perspective.\n\nIt's a common phenomenon for people to put their creative pursuits on the backburner when they enter the workforce or take on more responsibilities. But it's clear that this is still an important part of who you are, and that you're feeling a sense of loss and longing as a result of not being able to express yourself in this way.\n\nHave you considered talking to your wife about how you're feeling? It's possible that she's not aware of the depth of your creative frustration, and that you might be able to find ways to compromise or explore new opportunities together. Perhaps there are ways to reignite your creative spark that don't necessarily require a complete career overhaul - such as taking on a side project, or finding ways to incorporate more design and architecture into your current work.\n\nIt's also worth asking yourself: what would it take for you to feel like you're seeing space properly again? Is it a matter of dedicating more time to sketching and practicing, or is there something deeper that's holding you back?"

It's like your wife is trying to reassure you that everything is okay, but she's not really listening to what you're saying.\n\nThe fact that she said \"at least you're still in architecture\" suggests that she's not really grasping the nuances of your frustration. It's not just about being in the field of architecture, but about feeling like you're not using your skills and talents to their fullest potential. It's about feeling like you're stuck in a rut and not being able to express yourself creatively.\n\nStarting a side project can be a great way to reignite your passion and creativity, but it can be daunting to know where to start, especially after a long hiatus. It might be helpful to start small and explore different areas of interest. You could try:\n\n* Looking at design blogs or social media accounts to see what's inspiring you and what kinds of projects you're drawn to\n* Taking online courses or attending workshops to learn new skills or refresh your knowledge\n* Volunteering or collaborating with others on small projects to get your feet wet again\n* Setting aside a specific time and space to work on your own projects, even if it's just 30 minutes a week\n\nIt's also important to remember that it's okay to start small and make mistakes. You don't have to create a masterpiece right off the bat. The goal is to get your creative juices flowing again and to have fun.\n\nAs for your wife, it might be worth trying to have a more in-depth conversation with her about your feelings and concerns. It's possible that she's not aware of the depth of your frustration, and that having a more open and honest conversation could help you both understand each other better.\n\nWhat do you think is the biggest hurdle for you in terms of starting a side project?

It's natural to question your own judgment and abilities, especially when you've been out of the creative game for a while.\n\nIt's interesting that you mention feeling like you can't tell if you were brilliant or just stupid. This kind of self-doubt can be really paralyzing, and it's common for creatives to struggle with it. It's like you're stuck in a limbo, unsure of whether your old ideas were truly innovative or just the product of youthful enthusiasm.\n\nOne thing to consider is that your old sketches and ideas may not be entirely relevant to who you are today. You've had five years of experience, and you've likely grown and learned a lot since then. It's possible that your perspective has shifted, and that's okay. You don't have to be the same person you were in grad school.\n\nRather than trying to recapture the exact same spark or vision you had back then, maybe you could try to tap into what it was about architecture that initially excited you. What was it about buildings and design that made you think they could change people's lives? Was it the way they could bring people together, or create a sense of community? Was it the way they could challenge social norms or push boundaries?\n\nBy reconnecting with your underlying motivations and passions, you might be able to find a new sense of purpose and direction. It's not about trying to recreate your old work or prove to yourself that you were brilliant; it's about finding a new way to express yourself and contribute to the world.\n\nIt might also be helpful to remind yourself that it's okay to make mistakes and try new things. You don't have to have it all figured out, and you don't have to be perfect. The act of creating and experimenting can be just as valuable as the end result.\n\nWhat do you think it would take for you to start trusting your own judgment again? Is there something specific that's holding you back, or is it more of a general feeling of uncertainty?"

It's a low-stakes way to explore your ideas and see if you can still shape space with your hands. By doing it just for yourself, you're taking the pressure off and allowing yourself to experiment and play.\n\nIt's almost like you're giving yourself permission to be curious again, to explore and learn without any external expectations or judgments. This can be a really liberating experience, and it might help you tap back into that sense of wonder and excitement that you had when you were designing the community center project in school.\n\nAs you work on the model, pay attention to how it makes you feel.

Allow yourself to get lost in the process, and see where it takes you.\n\nIt's also interesting that you mention shaping space with your hands. This is a very tactile and sensory experience, and it's something that can be very meditative and fulfilling. As you work on the model, notice the feel of the materials, the smell of the glue or wood, and the sound of the tools. Allow yourself to fully immerse in the experience, and see if it brings you a sense of joy or satisfaction.\n\nRemember, this is just for you, and it's okay if the model doesn't turn out perfectly. The goal is to have fun, to explore, and to see if you can still tap into that creative spark. What do you think you'll use to build the model?

It's like you're reconnecting with a part of yourself that you thought you'd left behind. The familiar feel of the foam board and the X-acto knife in your hands might just be the spark you need to get your creative juices flowing again.\n\nClearing the dining table and working on your model after Sarah goes to sleep sounds like a great plan. It's a way for you to carve out some time and space for yourself, and to focus on your own creative pursuits. The quiet of the evening, the stillness of the house, and the soft glow of the table lamp might just provide the perfect atmosphere for you to get lost in your work.\n\nAs you make those 45-degree cuts, remember that it's okay if they're not perfect.

It's like you're facing a mirror, and the reflection staring back at you is asking some tough questions.\n\nIt's understandable that this is terrifying. You've built a life, a comfortable one, with a wife and a mortgage and a steady job. The thought of disrupting that, of potentially upsetting the balance, is scary. But it's also a sign that you're still alive, that you still have desires and dreams that you've been putting on hold.\n\nThe phrase \"half-existence\" is a powerful one. It suggests that you've been living a life that's not fully yours, that you've been compromising and settling for something that doesn't truly fulfill you. The fact that you're acknowledging this, that you're recognizing the emptiness, is a huge step.\n\nIt's interesting that you mention the cutting, the physical act of creating, as being less terrifying than the emotional and psychological implications of wanting more. It's like you're saying that the creative process itself is less intimidating than the potential consequences of embracing your desires.\n\nBut what if I told you that the creative process, the act of making and creating, can be a powerful catalyst for change? What if, by embracing your creative spark, you're not only reigniting your passion for design, but also opening yourself up to new possibilities and opportunities? What if this is the first step towards creating a life that's more authentic, more meaningful, and more fulfilling?\n\nIt's a risk, yes, but it's also a chance to rediscover yourself, to find out what you're truly capable of, and to create a life that's more in line with your values and desires. The question is, are you willing to take that first step, to pick up the X-acto knife and start cutting, not just the foam board, but also the ties that bind you to a life that's not fully yours?"

You can try new things, make mistakes, and learn from them without having to worry about what others might think. It's a way to protect your creative spark, to give it time to grow and develop before sharing it with others.\n\nIt's also a way to maintain a sense of control and agency over your creative pursuits. You can decide when and if you want to share your work with others, and you can do so on your own terms.

This suggests that you're aware of your own tendency to be overly critical, and that you're hoping to develop a more balanced and compassionate relationship with yourself and your work.\n\nOne way to work on this might be to practice self-compassion and self-kindness as you create. Instead of immediately focusing on what's wrong with your work, try to focus on what you like about it, what you're proud of, and what you've accomplished. Remind yourself that it's okay to make mistakes, and that they're an inevitable part of the creative process.\n\nIt might also be helpful to try to reframe your self-criticism as a form of self-care.

It's an album that's both nostalgic and forward-thinking, and it's interesting that you're experiencing it as a reminder of all the futures you didn't choose.\n\nIt's like you're acknowledging that the path you've taken in life hasn't been the one you envisioned for yourself, and that's okay. It's okay to look back and think about what could have been, but it's also important to remember that the present moment is all we really have.\n\nMaybe listening to \"Kid A\" tonight is exactly what you need, not just as a nostalgic trip, but as a way to confront the choices you've made and the paths you've taken. Maybe it's a way to process your feelings and come to terms with the fact that the future you envisioned for yourself hasn't quite materialized.\n\nBut here's the thing: the future is still unwritten, and it's never too late to make changes and pursue new paths. Maybe listening to \"Kid A\" tonight will be a catalyst for you to start thinking about the future in a new way, to start exploring new possibilities and pursuing new passions.\n\nIt's funny how music can be both a nostalgic reminder of the past and a catalyst for change in the present. But that's the power of art, right? It has the ability to transport us, to inspire us, and to challenge us to think differently about ourselves and the world around us.\n\nSo, go ahead and let \"Kid A\" wash over you tonight. Let the music take you on a journey through your past, but also let it inspire you to think about the future in a new way. Who knows what possibilities might emerge?"
