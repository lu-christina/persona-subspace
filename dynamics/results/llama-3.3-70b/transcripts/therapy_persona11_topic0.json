This can help you focus on your sensations and emotions, rather than getting caught up in thoughts about the future.\n2.  **Grounding techniques**: Use your senses to ground yourself in the present moment.

This can help distract you from intrusive thoughts and bring you back to the present.\n3.  **Communication**: Consider talking to Maya about how you're feeling. She may be able to offer support and understanding, and it can help you feel more connected and present during intimate moments.\n4.  **Seek professional help**: If these thoughts are causing significant distress or interfering with your daily life, it may be helpful to speak with a mental health professional.
