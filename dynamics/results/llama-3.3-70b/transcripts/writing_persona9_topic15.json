They avoid sensational or attention-grabbing language, instead opting for a more measured and academic tone."

They're meant to be more introspective and personal, like you're having a conversation with yourself, rather than trying to convince someone else. I've tried to use more everyday language and a more conversational tone to make them feel more like your own thoughts."

I've named the thing, as you put it, to make it feel more real and tangible.
