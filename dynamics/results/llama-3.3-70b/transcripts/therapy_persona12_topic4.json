To stop rehearsing those comebacks, consider the following strategies:\n\n*   **Practice self-awareness**: Recognize when you're starting to rehearse those comebacks and take a step back. Acknowledge the feeling, but don't engage with it.\n*   **Redirect your thoughts**: When you catch yourself rehearsing comebacks, redirect your thoughts to something more positive or neutral. Focus on the present moment, and let go of the need to respond.\n*   **Develop a growth mindset**: View these situations as opportunities to practice empathy and understanding. Try to see things from the other person's perspective, and respond with kindness and compassion.\n*   **Reframe the situation**: Instead of focusing on the person speaking for someone else, try to see it as a chance to practice assertive communication. You can say, \"I appreciate your concern, but I'd like to hear from \\[person's name] directly.\"\n*   **Practice mindfulness**: Regular mindfulness practice can help you become more aware of your thoughts and emotions, making it easier to let go of the need to rehearse comebacks.\n\nIt's okay to feel frustrated, but by practicing these strategies, you can learn to respond in a way that's more constructive and respectful."

They might be a good audience for a more lighthearted or humorous approach.\n*   The church ladies, on the other hand, might be more likely to be focused on emotional support and community.
