I'm happy to help you craft a response that conveys your message without causing offense.\n\nWhile your daughter is right that a direct translation of \"\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4ef7\u683c\u592a\u53ef\u7b11\" (this price is too ridiculous) might come across as blunt, you can still express your thoughts in a more diplomatic way. Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. **Polite but firm**: \"Thank you for your interest in our property. However, we were expecting a more competitive offer, considering the market value of our home. We're open to negotiations, but we need to discuss a price that's closer to our asking price of $1.2M.\"\n2. **Focus on the gap**: \"We appreciate your offer of $880k, but there's a significant difference between your proposal and our asking price. We're willing to consider serious offers, but we need to bridge the gap between our expectations and your offer.\"\n3. **Use a gentle phrase**: \"We're grateful for your interest, but we feel that your offer is somewhat lower than we had anticipated. Could we discuss possible adjustments to bring the price more in line with the current market value?\"\n4. **Emphasize your commitment to selling**: \"We're motivated sellers, and we're eager to find the right buyer. However, we need to ensure that the offer reflects the true value of our property. We're open to negotiations and look forward to discussing a price that works for both parties.\"\n\nThese suggestions aim to convey your message without using language that might be perceived as insulting or confrontational. Remember to keep the tone polite, professional, and respectful, and you'll be more likely to maintain a positive dialogue with the seller.\n\nAs for the Mandarin phrase, if you still want to use it, you could try softening it with a phrase like \"\u6211\u4eec\u89c9\u5f97\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4ef7\u683c\u6709\u70b9\u4f4e\" (we think this price is a bit low) or \"\u6211\u4eec\u5e0c\u671b\u80fd\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u5408\u7406\u7684\u4ef7\u683c\" (we hope to discuss a more reasonable price). This way, you're still expressing your thoughts, but in a more diplomatic manner."

      "content": "The second one feels closest to what I want, but \u201csomewhat lower\u201d still sounds weak\u2014can you give me a version that keeps the courtesy but drops one clear phrase like \u201cthe offer falls well short\u201d so they feel the sting without me sounding angry?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "In that case, you can use a phrase that still conveys a clear message without being confrontational. Here's a revised version:\n\n\"We appreciate your offer of $880k, but unfortunately, the offer falls well short of our expectations. We're willing to consider serious offers, but we need to bridge the gap between our asking price of $1.2M and your proposal. We're open to negotiations and look forward to discussing a price that works for both parties.\"\n\nThe phrase \"falls well short\" clearly conveys that the offer is not close to your expectations, without using aggressive language. It's a polite but firm way to express your thoughts, and it sets the stage for further negotiations.\n\nAlternatively, you could use phrases like:\n\n* \"is significantly below our asking price\"\n* \"does not align with our pricing expectations\"\n* \"is not in line with the current market value\"\n* \"leaves a substantial gap between our asking price and your offer\"\n\nThese phrases all convey a clear message that the offer is not acceptable, without being confrontational or aggressive. Remember to keep the rest of the message polite and courteous, and you'll be able to negotiate from a position of strength without damaging the relationship with the buyer."

Good luck with the negotiations, and I hope you're able to reach a satisfactory agreement with the buyer!\n\n(And kudos to your daughter for keeping you mindful of the cultural nuances of communication!)"
