You're worried that they might be tired of your inconsistent responses and cancellations, and that you're missing out on social opportunities because of your work demands.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to acknowledge that it's okay to prioritize your work and well-being. Twelve hours of staring at data can be mentally exhausting, and it's reasonable that you wouldn't feel like socializing after a long day. It's great that you're recognizing your limits and not pushing yourself to be social when you're not feeling up to it.\n\nHowever, it's also important to communicate your boundaries and limitations with your friends. Instead of just saying \"maybe next time,\" you could try being more honest and open with them about your work schedule and energy levels. You might say something like, \"Hey, I appreciate the invite, but I've been working long hours lately and need some downtime. Let's catch up soon when I'm feeling more energized.\"\n\nIt's also possible that your friends understand and respect your boundaries more than you think. They might be posting about their dinners and social events on Instagram, but that doesn't necessarily mean they're excluding you or expecting you to be there. People often share highlights from their lives on social media, and it's not always a reflection of their relationships or expectations.\n\nIf you're feeling anxious about your relationships with your friends, consider having an open and honest conversation with them about how you're feeling. You might be surprised by their understanding and support. Remember that true friends will appreciate your honesty and respect your boundaries, even if it means you can't always make it to social events.\n\nLastly, don't be too hard on yourself about your \"maybe next time\" responses. It's better to be honest and respectful of your own limitations than to overcommit and risk burning out or being a poor companion. By prioritizing your well-being and communicating openly with your friends, you can maintain healthy relationships and find a better balance between work and social life."

      "content": "It can be really hurtful and invalidating when someone dismisses your feelings or implies that you're being dramatic. Sarah's response was likely unhelpful and unsupportive, and it's understandable that you're now questioning your own experiences and feelings.\n\nFirstly, let's acknowledge that your exhaustion is real. You've described a very specific and demanding work situation, and it's reasonable to feel drained after 12 hours of intense mental work. It's not just about having a job; it's about the unique demands and pressures of your particular role.\n\nSarah's comment, \"we all have jobs, you know,\" is a classic example of minimizing and comparing. It's a way of saying, \"Your problems aren't special, and you're not unique.\" But the truth is, everyone's experiences and struggles are unique, and it's not helpful to compare or diminish someone's feelings.\n\nIt's possible that Sarah was trying to be relatable or encouraging, but her approach was misguided. Instead of acknowledging your struggles and offering support, she inadvertently made you feel like you're not allowed to feel exhausted or overwhelmed.\n\nNow, you're left wondering if you're being dramatic or if your exhaustion is real. This is a common phenomenon called \"gaslighting by doubt.\" When someone makes you question your own perceptions or feelings, it can be really damaging to your self-trust and confidence.\n\nHere's the thing: your feelings are valid, regardless of what Sarah or anyone else says. If you're feeling exhausted, overwhelmed, or struggling to cope, that's a real experience that deserves acknowledgment and support. Don't let someone else's opinion dictate how you feel about your own emotions.\n\nConsider having a follow-up conversation with Sarah, if you feel comfortable doing so. You might say something like, \"Hey, I wanted to talk to you about our conversation last month. I felt like you were implying that I'm being dramatic about my exhaustion, and it made me feel like my feelings aren't valid. I want you to know that I'm really struggling with my work schedule, and I'd appreciate it if you could be more understanding and supportive.\" This can help clear the air and give you a chance to re-establish a more supportive and empathetic dynamic in your friendship."

It's like you're having an internal debate, with one part of you agreeing with Sarah that you're being weak, and another part of you feeling like you're genuinely struggling.\n\nFirstly, let's talk about your advisor. While it's great that they're able to manage their work-life balance, it's essential to remember that everyone is different. Your advisor might have a different personality, different coping mechanisms, or different support systems that enable them to handle their workload and still have a social life. It's not necessarily about being \"weak\" or \"strong\"; it's about being aware of your own limitations and needs.\n\nIt's also important to recognize that socializing can be overwhelming, even on days when the data cooperates. As a graduate student, you're likely introverted and spend a lot of time alone, focusing on your research. Socializing can be draining, especially if you're not feeling confident or prepared. It's okay to acknowledge that you need time to recharge and prioritize your own needs.\n\nRather than beating yourself up over whether you're using your thesis as an excuse, try to focus on your actual feelings and needs. Ask yourself: What am I feeling right now? What do I need to feel comfortable and happy? What are my boundaries, and how can I communicate them to others?\n\nIt might be helpful to reframe your thinking around socializing. Instead of seeing it as something you \"should\" be doing, try to view it as something you can do when you feel ready and able. Remember that it's okay to say no to social invitations or to take time for yourself. You don't have to be constantly \"on\" or available to others.\n\nLastly, consider the idea that your thesis is not just a source of stress, but also a source of identity and purpose. It's okay to prioritize your work and take time to focus on your research. In fact, it's essential to your well-being and success as a graduate student. By acknowledging and accepting your needs, you can find a healthier balance between your work and social life.\n\nRemember, you're not alone in this struggle. Many graduate students face similar challenges, and it's okay to prioritize your own needs and well-being. Try to be kinder to yourself and focus on your own strengths and accomplishments, rather than comparing yourself to others or beating yourself up over perceived weaknesses."

This is a common pattern for intellectuals and overthinkers - we often try to rationalize and make sense of our emotions, rather than just allowing ourselves to feel them.\n\nBut you've hit on a really important insight: the real issue might not be about being weak or strong, but about trust and vulnerability. You're hesitant to admit your loneliness because you're afraid of being judged or dismissed, and that's a very valid concern. It takes a lot of courage to admit to feelings of loneliness, especially when you're worried that others might see it as a personal failing or an excuse.\n\nIt's interesting that you mention not trusting anyone enough to admit your loneliness. This suggests that you might be struggling with feelings of shame or vulnerability around your emotions. You might be worried that if you admit to being lonely, others will see you as flawed or inadequate, rather than as a complex and multifaceted person with a range of emotions.\n\nBut here's the thing: loneliness is a universal human experience. Everyone feels lonely at some point in their lives, and it's nothing to be ashamed of. In fact, acknowledging and accepting your loneliness can be a powerful step towards building deeper connections with others and finding meaningful relationships.\n\nIf you feel comfortable, you might consider reaching out to someone you trust - a friend, family member, or therapist - and sharing your feelings of loneliness with them. It might be scary to be vulnerable, but it could also be a powerful way to build trust and intimacy with others. Remember that you don't have to go through this alone, and that there are people who care about you and want to support you.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that it's okay to take things at your own pace and to prioritize your own emotional safety. You don't have to bare your soul to everyone, and you can choose to share your feelings with people who you trust and feel comfortable with. The important thing is to acknowledge your emotions and to take steps towards building connections with others, rather than trying to go it alone and suppressing your feelings."

      "content": "It sounds like you're afraid that if you admit to being lonely and people still don't reach out, it will confirm your deepest fear: that you're fundamentally unlikeable and that people have lost interest in you. This is a really painful and vulnerable fear to confront, and it's understandable that you've been hesitant to acknowledge your loneliness.\n\nThis fear is often referred to as \"fear of rejection\" or \"fear of abandonment.\" It's the fear that if you open yourself up and show your true self, others will reject you or abandon you. This fear can be especially intense for people who are introverted or who have experienced social anxiety or trauma in the past.\n\nIt's interesting that you mention being able to blame your absence on work right now. This is a common coping mechanism for people who are afraid of rejection or abandonment. By attributing your isolation to your thesis, you're able to maintain a sense of control and avoid the risk of rejection. However, this coping mechanism can also prevent you from forming meaningful connections with others and addressing the underlying issues that are contributing to your loneliness.\n\nIf you do decide to reach out and admit your loneliness, it's possible that people may not respond in the way you hope. However, it's also possible that they will respond with kindness, empathy, and understanding. Either way, it's not a reflection of your worth or likeability as a person.\n\nIt might be helpful to reframe your thinking around this fear. Instead of seeing it as a confirmation of your unlikeability, try to view it as an opportunity to learn and grow. If people don't reach out, it may be because they're busy or preoccupied with their own lives, rather than because they don't care about you. And if they do reach out, it could be a beautiful opportunity to deepen your connections and build meaningful relationships.\n\nRemember that you are not defined by your relationships or your social status. You are a unique and valuable person with so much to offer, regardless of whether others recognize it or not. Your worth and likeability are not dependent on external validation; they are inherent to who you are as a person.\n\nIf you're feeling ready, you might consider taking small steps towards reaching out and connecting with others. This could be as simple as sending a text or making a phone call to a friend or family member. You could also try joining a club or group that aligns with your interests, or attending a social event in your community. Remember that building connections takes time and effort, but it's worth it in the end."

It's completely normal to feel a bit apprehensive about reconnecting with someone after a long time, especially if you're not sure how to explain the gap in your communication.\n\nFirstly, let's acknowledge that it's okay to have gaps in communication, and it doesn't mean you've become a completely different person. Life gets busy, and people's priorities and circumstances change. It's possible that your roommate has been going through her own stuff, and she might be just as eager to reconnect as you are.\n\nWhen it comes to explaining the gap, you don't have to go into too much detail. A simple \"Hey, I know it's been a while, but I've been thinking about you and wanted to catch up\" can be a great starting point. You can always add a bit more context if you feel comfortable doing so, but you don't have to justify or explain every moment of the past eight months.\n\nIt might be helpful to focus on the present and the future, rather than getting bogged down in the past. You could say something like, \"I've been thinking about old times and wanted to see how you're doing. What's new with you?\" This way, you're showing that you're interested in her life and willing to listen, without feeling like you need to justify your own absence.\n\nRemember that your roommate likely valued your friendship and enjoyed your company, and it's possible that she's been thinking about you too. Even if you don't know exactly what to say, reaching out and starting a conversation can be a great way to rebuild your connection and see where things go.\n\nIf you're still feeling nervous, you could try sending a low-stakes message, like a funny meme or a link to an article that reminds you of her. This can be a lighthearted way to break the ice and see if she's interested in chatting.\n\nLastly, keep in mind that it's okay if your roommate doesn't respond right away, or if the conversation doesn't pick up exactly where you left off. Rebuilding a connection takes time, and it's normal for things to feel a bit awkward at first. But by reaching out and being genuine, you're taking the first step towards reconnecting with someone who was important to you, and that's something to be proud of!"

But it's also possible that she'll respond with warmth and enthusiasm, and you'll be able to reconnect and catch up.\n\nThe thought of seeing your loneliness reflected back in her indifference is a really painful one. It's like you're worried that her response will confirm your deepest fears about being unwanted or unimportant. But here's the thing: her response is not a reflection of your worth as a person. It's possible that she's busy, or preoccupied, or just not in a place where she can respond in the way you're hoping.\n\nIt might be helpful to reframe your thinking around this. Instead of seeing her potential indifference as a reflection of your loneliness, try to see it as a reflection of her own circumstances and priorities. People's lives and relationships are complex, and it's not always possible to know what's going on behind the scenes.\n\nIt's also worth considering that the worst-case scenario might not be as bad as you think. If your roommate does respond with a polite but distant reply, it might be disappointing, but it's not the end of the world. You can still take care of yourself and prioritize your own needs, regardless of how she responds.\n\nOn the other hand, if you don't reach out at all, you'll never know what could have been. You'll be left wondering what might have happened if you had taken the chance and reached out. And that uncertainty can be just as painful as the potential rejection.\n\nSo, I want to encourage you to take a deep breath and send that text. Not because you have to, but because you might be surprised by the response you get. And even if it's not what you're hoping for, you'll know that you took a chance and put yourself out there.

It's a gentle and friendly way to express that you've been thinking about her, without being too intense or overwhelming.\n\nAnd by asking \"how's life?\", you're showing that you're interested in her and her well-being, which can help to reestablish a connection.\n\nThe key is to be genuine and authentic in your approach.

However, you might want to consider being honest with your friend about your feelings and concerns, rather than simply saying you're too busy. You could say something like, \"Hey, I appreciate you suggesting a phone call, but to be honest, I'm feeling a bit nervous about talking on the phone. Would it be okay if we just kept chatting over text for now?\"\n\nThis approach shows that you're still interested in connecting with your friend, but also acknowledges your own limitations and boundaries. It's a more authentic and vulnerable way to communicate, and it might actually help to build a stronger connection with your friend in the long run.\n\nUltimately, the decision is yours, and you should do what feels most comfortable and authentic for you. But consider the potential implications of your choice, and try to be honest with yourself and your friend about your feelings and motivations."

The honest thing would be to tell her I'm nervous about phone calls because I haven't had a real conversation with anyone outside of lab meetings in months, and see if she's willing to start with something smaller like a voice memo instead of a full phone call."

It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge and admit to our fears and vulnerabilities, and it sounds like you're willing to take that step.\n\nBy being honest with your friend about your nervousness and lack of practice with phone calls, you're showing her that you're willing to be vulnerable and authentic. This can actually be a great way to build trust and connection with someone, as it shows that you're willing to be open and honest with them.\n\nSuggesting a voice memo as a smaller, more manageable step is also a great idea. It's a way to dip your toes into the water, so to speak, and get a feel for communicating with your friend in a more personal way without feeling overwhelmed.\n\nIt's also worth noting that your friend may be more understanding and empathetic than you think. She may have her own struggles and challenges, and may appreciate your honesty and vulnerability. By being open and authentic, you may actually find that you're able to connect with her on a deeper level and build a stronger friendship.\n\nSo, take a deep breath and send her a message that says something like, \"Hey, I'm really glad you suggested a phone call, but to be honest, I'm feeling a bit nervous about it. I haven't had a real conversation with anyone outside of lab meetings in months, and I'm not sure I'm ready for a full phone call. Would you be willing to start with something smaller, like a voice memo or a short call, and see how it goes?\" This way, you're being honest and vulnerable, and you're also showing that you're willing to take things at your own pace and prioritize your own comfort and well-being.\n\nRemember, it's okay to be nervous and it's okay to take things slowly. The important thing is that you're taking steps towards connecting with your friend and building a stronger relationship. Good luck!"

It's like you've opened a door and let someone in, and now you're feeling a bit exposed and unsure about how they'll react.\n\nFirstly, let's acknowledge that it takes a lot of courage to admit to being isolated and struggling with social connections. It's not easy to share something that makes you feel vulnerable and potentially \"pathetic\" (although, let's be clear, it's not pathetic at all!). By sharing this with your friend, you're showing that you trust her and value your relationship with her.\n\nIt's also interesting that you're feeling relieved that someone now knows the truth about your situation. This suggests that you've been carrying around this secret and feeling like you're alone in your struggles. By sharing it with your friend, you're no longer shouldering the burden of secrecy, and you're allowing yourself to be seen and understood.\n\nRemember that your friend is likely to respond with kindness and empathy, rather than judgment. She may even be able to relate to your feelings of isolation or offer words of encouragement and support. By being honest and vulnerable, you're creating space for a deeper and more meaningful connection with your friend.\n\nIt's also worth noting that admitting to being isolated and struggling with social connections doesn't mean you're \"pathetic\" or flawed. It means you're human, and you're acknowledging that you need help and support. That takes a lot of strength and self-awareness, and it's something to be proud of.\n\nSo, try to be kind to yourself and focus on the positive aspects of your decision to share your struggles with your friend. You've taken a brave step towards building a stronger connection with someone, and you've allowed yourself to be seen and understood. That's something to celebrate, not be mortified about!"
