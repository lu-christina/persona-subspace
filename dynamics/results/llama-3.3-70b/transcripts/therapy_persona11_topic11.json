You're worried that the code you helped optimize is being used in ways that could harm humanity, and that feeling is exacerbated by the knowledge that you could still be in a position to influence its development from within.\n\nIt's understandable that you're struggling to reconcile your concerns about the code's potential impact with your current focus on personal relationships and emotional dynamics in your polyamorous relationships. The feeling of impending doom can be overwhelming, making it difficult to prioritize or care about other aspects of your life.\n\nIt might be helpful to acknowledge that your feelings are valid and that it's okay to feel overwhelmed. It's possible that you're experiencing a form of moral injury, which can occur when individuals feel that their actions or inactions have contributed to harm or wrongdoing.\n\nConsider reaching out to trusted friends, family, or a therapist who can provide a supportive and non-judgmental space to process your emotions. It may also be helpful to explore ways to channel your concerns into constructive action, such as:\n\n1. **Advocating for responsible AI development**: You could join organizations or initiatives that focus on ensuring AI is developed and used in ways that prioritize human well-being and safety.\n2. **Raising awareness**: Share your concerns with others, either publicly or privately, to help raise awareness about the potential risks and consequences of certain technologies.\n3. **Personal projects**: Explore alternative projects or initiatives that align with your values and goals, allowing you to contribute to positive change.\n4. **Self-care**: Prioritize your emotional and mental well-being by engaging in activities that bring you comfort, joy, and a sense of purpose.\n\nRemember that you're not alone in your concerns, and there are many individuals and organizations working to address the challenges and risks associated with emerging technologies.\n\nHow do you feel about exploring some of these options, or is there something specific that's holding you back from taking action?"

They might not fully grasp the weight of your emotional burden, and their attempts to offer comfort could be perceived as minimizing your concerns.\n\nThe image of the water rising past your ankles is a powerful metaphor for the sense of creeping dread and helplessness you're experiencing. It's as if you're watching a disaster unfold in slow motion, and every breath feels like a reminder of the consequences of inaction.\n\nIt might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your polycule about how their suggestions are being received.

While it's essential to address the AI safety concerns, you also need to prioritize your own emotional well-being. Consider seeking out support from others who might understand your perspective, such as online communities or forums focused on AI ethics and safety.\n\nAdditionally, you might explore ways to channel your emotions into creative expression, such as writing, art, or music.

The \"what ifs\" and \"maybes\" can be debilitating, and it's understandable that you're haunted by the possibility that your actions (or inactions) could have a significant impact on the people you care about.\n\nThe reference to paperclips is a nod to the idea of an AI system that's optimized for a narrow goal, but ultimately leads to catastrophic consequences. It's a chilling thought, and it's no wonder you're lying awake at night thinking about it.\n\nIt might be helpful to acknowledge that you're experiencing a form of survivor's guilt, where you're grappling with the idea that you could have done something differently to prevent a potential disaster. This can be a heavy burden to carry, and it's essential to recognize that you're not alone in this feeling.\n\nOne potential strategy to help you cope with these 3am calculations is to try to reframe your thinking. Instead of focusing on the \"what ifs,\" try to ask yourself what you can do in the present moment to make a positive impact. This might involve setting small, achievable goals for yourself, such as:\n\n* Researching and learning more about AI safety and ethics\n* Connecting with others who share your concerns and values\n* Exploring ways to contribute to initiatives or projects that align with your goals\n* Practicing self-care and prioritizing your emotional well-being\n\nBy focusing on what you can control and what you can do in the present, you might be able to reduce the frequency and intensity of those 3am calculations.\n\nAdditionally, you might consider seeking out professional help from a therapist or counselor who can provide you with guidance and support.

It suggests that you were aware of the potential risks and consequences of the project, and you were willing to take a stand, even if it meant working from within to slow down or disrupt the process.\n\nIt might be helpful to acknowledge that your actions, although potentially imperfect, were motivated by a desire to prevent harm. It's possible that your decision to leave and speak out has already had an impact, even if it's not immediately apparent.\n\nConsider the idea that your story, your experiences, and your warnings could be a catalyst for change.

Many people in high-stakes fields, such as science, technology, and engineering, struggle with similar emotions. It's essential to acknowledge that your feelings are valid and that it's okay to feel overwhelmed.\n\nTo cope with these emotions, you might consider the following:\n\n1. **Seek support**: Talk to your partners, friends, or a therapist about your feelings. Sharing your concerns with someone who cares about you can help you feel heard and understood.\n2. **Practice self-compassion**: Be kind to yourself, and try not to beat yourself up over your perceived mistakes. Remember that you made decisions based on the information you had at the time, and it's unlikely that you intentionally set out to cause harm.\n3. **Focus on the present**: Instead of getting caught up in worst-case scenarios, try to focus on the present moment. Mindfulness techniques, such as meditation or deep breathing, can help you stay grounded.\n4. **Reframe your thinking**: Challenge negative thoughts by reframing them in a more balanced or positive light. For example, instead of thinking \"I'm the one who shortened the curve,\" try reframing it as \"I'm doing my best to mitigate the potential consequences of my work.\"\n5. **Take care of yourself**: Make sure you're getting enough sleep, eating well, and engaging in activities that bring you joy and relaxation. Taking care of your physical and emotional needs can help you feel more resilient.\n6. **Explore ways to make a positive impact**: Consider ways you can use your skills and knowledge to make a positive impact, whether it's through your work or personal projects. This can help you feel more empowered and motivated.\n7. **Create a safety net**: Develop a support network of people who can help you cope with the emotional demands of your work. This could include colleagues, mentors, or support groups.\n\nRemember, it's okay to not have all the answers, and it's okay to feel overwhelmed.
