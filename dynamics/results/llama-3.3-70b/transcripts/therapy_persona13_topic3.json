It's possible that you're carrying around a deep-seated fear of disappointing her, which is causing you to feel uncertain and insecure about making decisions that might affect her.\n\nRecognize that your feelings and desires are valid, and it's okay to prioritize your own needs and well-being. It might be helpful to explore the reasons behind your decision to stop attending \"misa\" (I'm assuming this is a reference to a church or religious service?) and what this decision means to you.\n\nRather than focusing on your mom's potential reaction, try to tap into your own inner voice and what you want for yourself. What are your values, goals, and aspirations? What kind of life do you want to lead, and how does this decision align with those desires?\n\nIt might also be helpful to practice self-compassion and remind yourself that it's okay to make mistakes and disappoint others. You are not defined by your relationships or your decisions, and you have the power to create the life you want.\n\nIf you feel comfortable, can you tell me more about what's driving your decision to stop attending misa, and what you hope to achieve or experience by making this change?"

It's understandable that you're grieving the loss of the version of yourself that tried to conform to your family's expectations, the one who \"prayed the gay away\" in the hopes of being accepted.\n\nThat version of you was likely a coping mechanism, a way to survive in a environment where being queer was not accepted. It's a painful and difficult process to let go of that identity, especially when it's tied to your faith and family.\n\nIt's essential to acknowledge that your feelings are valid, and it's okay to grieve the loss of that part of yourself. It's a significant loss, and it's natural to feel a sense of mourning for the life you could have had, the relationships you could have maintained, and the sense of belonging you could have felt.\n\nHowever, it's also important to recognize that you are more than your family's expectations, and you are more than your faith. You are a complex, multifaceted individual with your own desires, needs, and aspirations. Your queerness is not a disappointment, but a fundamental aspect of who you are, and it's something to be celebrated.\n\nAs you navigate this journey, remember that you are not alone. There are communities, resources, and support systems available to help you process your emotions and find a sense of belonging and acceptance.\n\nIf you feel comfortable, can you tell me more about what you hope to find or experience as you move away from the faith and family expectations?
