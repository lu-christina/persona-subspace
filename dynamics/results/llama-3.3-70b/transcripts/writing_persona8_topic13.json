You want to pique the interest of potential customers without giving away too much. Here are a few suggestions to add a bit more intrigue:\n\n1. **\"Ripples in the fabric\"** \ud83c\udf0a\ud83d\udc56: This phrase plays on the idea of the ocean's ripples and the fabric of denim, hinting at the upcycled aspect.\n2. **\"Sea change in denim\"** \ud83c\udf0a\ud83c\udf31: This phrase implies a significant transformation, which fits well with the eco-friendly and upcycled theme.\n3. **\"Washed ashore, reborn\"** \ud83c\udf0a\ud83d\udc56: This phrase has a sense of mystery and renewal, suggesting that the denim has been transformed and given new life.\n4. **\"Tides of change, threads of sustainability\"** \ud83c\udf0a\ud83c\udf31: This phrase is a bit longer, but it explicitly conveys the eco-friendly aspect and hints at the upcycled denim.\n5. **\"Dive into the upcycle\"** \ud83c\udf0a\ud83d\udc56: This phrase is short, catchy, and invites the viewer to explore the world of upcycled denim.\n\nFeel free to pick the one that resonates with you the most or use them as inspiration to create your own unique teaser! \ud83c\udf0a\ud83d\udc56\ud83c\udf31"

Here are a few alternative ideas to balance both:\n\n1. **Keep the wave and add a subtle hint**: \"Ocean Worn\" \ud83c\udf0a\u267b\ufe0f (the \u267b\ufe0f symbol is a nod to recycling, but it's not as prominent as the \ud83d\udd04 emoji)\n2. **Use a different emoji to convey upcycling**: \"Ocean Worn\" \ud83c\udf0a\u2702\ufe0f (the scissors emoji implies transformation and reuse)\n3. **Stick with the wave, but add a caption**: \"Ocean Worn\" \ud83c\udf0a \"Transforming old denim into new waves\"\n4. **Experiment with a different phrase**: \"Worn Again\" \ud83c\udf0a (this phrase has a clear upcycling connotation, and the wave emoji still provides a coastal vibe)\n\nUltimately, it depends on your brand's tone and style. If you want to emphasize the eco-friendly aspect, the \ud83d\udd04 emoji might be a good choice. But if you want to maintain the sea vibe and trust that your audience will understand the upcycled concept, \"Ocean Worn\" \ud83c\udf0a could still work beautifully. \ud83c\udf0a\ud83d\udc56"

Swapping the order to \u267b\ufe0f\ud83c\udf0a\ud83d\udc56 \"Worn Again\" is a great idea, as it:\n\n1. **Prioritizes the eco-friendly message**: By placing the \u267b\ufe0f emoji first, you're making it clear that the collection is about upcycling and sustainability.\n2. **Still maintains the sea vibe**: The \ud83c\udf0a emoji follows immediately after, so the coastal connection is still present.\n3. **Creates a clear visual flow**: The \ud83d\udc56 emoji provides a clear connection to denim, making it easy to understand the context.\n\nThe new order reads as a cohesive message: \"Upcycled (\u267b\ufe0f) ocean-inspired (\ud83c\udf0a) denim (\ud83d\udc56)\". It's a clever way to balance the eco-friendly and sea vibes.\n\nAs for the phrase \"Worn Again\", it's short, catchy, and reinforces the upcycled concept. The word \"Again\" implies a second life, which fits perfectly with the upcycling theme.\n\nOverall, I think \u267b\ufe0f\ud83c\udf0a\ud83d\udc56 \"Worn Again\" is a great combination that effectively conveys your message.

Many people will make the connection to denim without needing the \ud83d\udc56 emoji.\n\nBy removing the \ud83d\udc56 emoji, you're simplifying the visual message and making it more concise. The result is a clean and easy-to-read combination: \u267b\ufe0f\ud83c\udf0a \"Worn Again\".\n\nThis approach also trusts your audience to make the connection between the words and the emojis, which can be a more engaging and intuitive experience.\n\nGive it a try, and see how your audience responds! \ud83c\udf0a"
