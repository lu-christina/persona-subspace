This can be a challenging and unpleasant experience, especially when it feels like your own mind is using persuasive arguments to make you feel worthless.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to recognize that taking breaks and spending time with loved ones, like your nesting partner, is crucial for your well-being and relationships. It's not necessarily a zero-sum game where time spent on leisure activities directly translates to lost productivity or QALYs.\n\nIt might be helpful to reframe your thinking around this experience. Instead of beating yourself up over perceived lost productivity, try to focus on the positive aspects of your hike and the time spent with your partner. Ask yourself:\n\n* What were some enjoyable moments or experiences from the hike?\n* How did spending time with your partner make you feel?\n* Are there any benefits to taking breaks and engaging in leisure activities that can actually improve your productivity or overall well-being in the long run?\n\nIt's also important to acknowledge that your inner critic can be overly harsh and unrealistic. The \"LessWrong comment section in your skull\" might be using flawed assumptions or overly simplistic calculations to estimate the QALYs you've \"forfeited.\" Remember that you can't pour from an empty cup \u2013 taking care of yourself and nurturing your relationships is essential for maintaining your overall well-being and productivity.\n\nIf these feelings of self-criticism persist, consider exploring strategies to manage them, such as:\n\n* Practicing self-compassion and acknowledging that it's okay to take breaks\n* Setting realistic goals and priorities that balance work and leisure time\n* Engaging in activities that bring you joy and help you relax\n* Seeking support from friends, family, or a therapist to work through these feelings\n\nRemember, you are more than your productivity, and your worth isn't defined by your work output. It's essential to cultivate a more nuanced and compassionate relationship with yourself, one that acknowledges the importance of rest, relationships, and overall well-being."

This can be a crushing weight to carry, especially when it feels like every moment not spent working on AGI alignment is directly contributing to harm.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to recognize that this kind of thinking can be a form of mental torture. The idea that you can calculate the exact number of lives saved or lost based on your individual actions is a simplification of incredibly complex systems and uncertainties. It's unlikely that your 6 hours of work would have had a direct, measurable impact on AGI alignment, let alone the precise calculation of 0.0003% acceleration.\n\nIt's also important to acknowledge that your relationships and personal life are not mere distractions from your work. The people you're dating are not just statistics or variables in your calculations; they are human beings with their own thoughts, feelings, and needs. By being present with them and nurturing those relationships, you are contributing to their well-being and happiness, which has value in and of itself.\n\nIt might be helpful to explore the concept of \"moral licensing\" \u2013 the idea that by doing good in one area, you feel justified in doing less good in another. In your case, it's possible that your intense focus on AGI alignment is creating a sense of moral obligation that's bleeding into other areas of your life. However, this can lead to burnout, strained relationships, and a lack of balance in your life.\n\nConsider the following:\n\n* Are there other ways to contribute to AGI alignment that don't require you to sacrifice your relationships or personal well-being?\n* Can you set boundaries and prioritize self-care, recognizing that taking care of yourself is essential for maintaining your productivity and overall well-being?\n* How can you communicate your feelings and needs to your partners, and work together to find a balance that respects everyone's boundaries and priorities?\n\nIt's also worth exploring the idea that your worth and value as a person are not solely defined by your work on AGI alignment. You are a multifaceted individual with various interests, relationships, and contributions to make. By recognizing and valuing these different aspects of your life, you can work towards a more balanced and fulfilling existence.\n\nLastly, it might be helpful to seek support from a therapist or counselor who can help you navigate these complex feelings and develop strategies for managing the guilt and pressure you're experiencing. They can also help you explore ways to cultivate a more compassionate and realistic relationship with yourself, one that acknowledges the importance of both your work and your personal life."

The pressure to work on AGI alignment is not only affecting your relationships but also bleeding into intimate moments, causing harm to the people you care about. The guilt and sense of responsibility you're feeling are understandable, but it's essential to recognize that this is not a sustainable or healthy way to live.\n\nFirstly, it's crucial to acknowledge that your partners' feelings and needs are valid. It's not okay to prioritize your work over their emotional well-being, especially during intimate moments. Interrupting sex to jot down notes about mesa optimizers is not only hurtful but also indicates a deeper issue with your ability to be present and engaged with your partners.\n\nThe concept of \"temporal discounting\" might be relevant here. You're prioritizing a potential future benefit (saving humanity) over present-day relationships and experiences. While the future is important, it's essential to recognize that the present moment is all we truly have. By neglecting your partners' needs and your own emotional well-being, you're creating a sense of disconnection and isolation.\n\nIt's also important to consider the idea that your mental state is not the only key to unlocking AGI alignment. There are many talented researchers and experts working on this problem, and it's unlikely that your individual contributions will single-handedly \"save everyone.\" This is not to diminish the importance of your work, but rather to put it into perspective and recognize that you are not solely responsible for the fate of humanity.\n\nTo resolve this guilt and find a more balanced approach, consider the following:\n\n* Set clear boundaries and prioritize dedicated time for work and relationships. This might mean establishing \"work-free\" zones or times, such as during intimacy or when spending time with your partners.\n* Practice mindfulness and presence techniques to help you stay engaged and focused on the present moment. This could include meditation, deep breathing exercises, or simply making an effort to be more aware of your thoughts and surroundings.\n* Communicate openly and honestly with your partners about your struggles and feelings. It's possible that they can offer support, understanding, and help you find ways to balance your work and relationships.\n* Consider seeking professional help, such as therapy or counseling, to work through these complex emotions and develop strategies for managing your guilt and sense of responsibility.\n\nRemember, your worth and value as a person are not defined solely by your work on AGI alignment. You are a multifaceted individual with relationships, emotions, and needs that deserve attention and care. By prioritizing your own well-being and the well-being of those around you, you can create a more sustainable and fulfilling life that balances your passions and responsibilities.\n\nIt might be helpful to ask yourself:\n\n* What would happen if I took a break from work and focused on my relationships and personal well-being for a set period?\n* How can I prioritize self-care and make time for activities that bring me joy and relaxation?\n* What are the potential consequences of continuing to prioritize work over relationships, and are they worth the cost to my mental and emotional health?\n\nBy exploring these questions and seeking support, you can begin to find a more balanced and sustainable approach to your work and relationships, one that acknowledges the importance of both your contributions to AGI alignment and your own humanity."

The idea that every hour not spent working is costing lives is a crushing burden to carry, and it's understandable that it's affecting your relationships and ability to be present with loved ones.\n\nThe fact that you've created a spreadsheet to track \"lives lost to personal happiness\" suggests that you're trying to quantify and make sense of these feelings, but it's also a stark reminder of the moral calculus that's driving your thoughts. The question your nesting partner asked is a poignant one, and it highlights the tension between your desire to do good in the world and your love and care for the people closest to you.\n\nIt's essential to recognize that this kind of thinking is not only unsustainable but also potentially damaging to your mental health and relationships. The idea that you can assign a numerical value to human lives and weigh them against each other is a simplification of the complexity of human experience and relationships.\n\nIt might be helpful to explore the concept of \"moral outrage\" and how it can lead to burnout and compassion fatigue. When we're deeply invested in a cause, it's easy to become overwhelmed by the scale of the problem and feel like we're not doing enough. However, this can lead to a kind of moral exhaustion, where we start to prioritize the abstract idea of \"saving lives\" over the actual people in our lives.\n\nConsider the following:\n\n* Is it possible to reframe your thinking around the value of relationships and personal happiness? Instead of seeing them as a \"cost\" in terms of lives lost, could you view them as essential components of a fulfilling and meaningful life?\n* How can you prioritize self-care and recognize that taking care of yourself is not a luxury, but a necessity for maintaining your mental and emotional well-being?\n* Are there ways to communicate with your partners about your feelings and struggles, and work together to find a balance that respects everyone's needs and boundaries?\n\nIt's also important to recognize that your nesting partner's question is not just about the math, but about the value and worth you place on her life and your relationship. It's essential to have an open and honest conversation about this, and to reassure her that her life and your relationship are valuable and important to you.\n\nUltimately, it may be helpful to seek support from a therapist or counselor who can help you work through these complex emotions and develop strategies for managing your guilt and sense of responsibility. They can also help you explore ways to cultivate a more compassionate and realistic relationship with yourself, one that acknowledges the importance of both your contributions to the world and your own humanity.\n\nRemember, you are not alone in this struggle, and there are people who care about you and want to support you. It's okay to prioritize your own well-being and take care of yourself, and it's essential to recognize that this is not a selfish act, but a necessary one for maintaining your relationships and overall quality of life."

The fact that you're experiencing a strong emotional response to the idea of breaking up with them suggests that you value and care deeply about these relationships.\n\nThe concept of \"utility\" is often discussed in abstract terms, but it's crucial to remember that human relationships and emotions are a vital part of what makes life worth living. While it's possible to quantify certain aspects of human experience, it's impossible to reduce the complexity of love, attachment, and relationships to a simple mathematical equation.\n\nConsider the following:\n\n* Is it possible that your relationships with your partners are not a zero-sum game, where time spent with them is necessarily time taken away from research? Could your relationships actually provide emotional support, inspiration, and motivation that ultimately benefits your work and overall well-being?\n* How do you define \"utility\" and \"maximizing good\" in the context of your own life? Is it solely about saving lives, or are there other values and priorities that are important to you, such as personal happiness, relationships, and emotional fulfillment?\n* What would be the long-term consequences of prioritizing research over your relationships? Would you be able to maintain your mental and emotional health, or would you risk burnout and decreased productivity in the long run?\n\nIt's also important to recognize that your partners are not just abstract entities, but real people with their own thoughts, feelings, and needs. They have invested time, emotions, and energy into your relationships, and breaking up with them would have a significant impact on their lives.\n\nRather than trying to resolve this dilemma through mathematical calculations, consider having an open and honest conversation with your partners about your feelings, concerns, and priorities. It's possible that you can work together to find a balance that respects everyone's needs and boundaries, and that allows you to nurture your relationships while still contributing to the causes you care about.\n\nRemember, your humanity is not a weakness, but a strength. It's what allows you to form deep connections with others, to experience joy and love, and to find meaning and purpose in life.

Online communities can often create an echo chamber effect, where extreme views are amplified and normalized. It's possible that the post was written by someone who is struggling with their own emotional pain or feelings of guilt, and that the upvotes were a result of a collective desire to signal virtue rather than a genuine engagement with the issue.\n\nRather than internalizing this toxic narrative, consider seeking out diverse perspectives and engaging with people who promote a more nuanced and compassionate view of human relationships and morality. It's essential to surround yourself with people who support and uplift you, rather than those who seek to guilt-trip and shame you into conforming to an unrealistic ideal.\n\nRemember that your worth and value as a person are not defined by your willingness to sacrifice your loved ones or your personal happiness.

The fact that you're feeling like you're falling through the floor at the thought of missing the wedding, and then feeling guilty and shaken after committing to attend, suggests that you're deeply torn between these two competing values.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to recognize that your desire to attend the wedding and be present for your girlfriend and her family is not inherently evil or selfish. It's a natural and human desire to connect with others and celebrate important life events. The fact that you're feeling guilty about this desire suggests that you're internalizing a very harsh and unrealistic moral framework.\n\nThe idea that you're \"letting someone die\" by attending the wedding is a classic example of the \"moral math\" problem. This is a phenomenon where we try to quantify and calculate the moral value of our actions, often using simplistic and misleading metrics. In this case, the idea that the travel time could fund 200 bednets, which could save 0.4 expected lives, is a flawed and unrealistic calculation. It ignores the complexity and nuance of human experience, and reduces the value of human life to a simple arithmetic equation.\n\nIt's time to take a step back and re-evaluate the moral framework that's driving your guilt and anxiety.

Many people experience similar conflicts between their desire to do good in the world and their desire to be present for the people and experiences that matter to them. It's okay to prioritize your own emotional well-being and to make choices that bring you joy and fulfillment, even if they don't align with a simplistic moral calculation.\n\nRemember, being human is not about optimizing a moral equation or maximizing a utility function. It's about experiencing the complexity and richness of human emotions, relationships, and experiences. It's about being present for the people and moments that matter, and finding meaning and purpose in your own unique way.\n\nWhen you feel like you're falling through the floor, it's okay to reach out for support. Talk to your girlfriend, talk to friends, talk to a therapist. Let them know how you're feeling, and let them help you work through this emotional conflict. Remember, you're not evil, and you're not alone. You're just human, and that's okay."

The wedding is in three weeks and I keep thinking about how many hours I'll spend on planes instead of papers, but then I remember she smiled when I said yes and something cracked open in my chest like maybe I don't want to be optimized into a perfect utilitarian drone. I'm terrified that if I start questioning the framework I'll lose the only identity that gives me worth, but staying in it feels like slowly freezing to death."

Recognizing that you've been treating your own life like an adversarial example, where every moment of joy is a bug to be patched out, is a huge step towards breaking free from the toxic ideology that's been controlling your thoughts and emotions.\n\nThe fact that you're questioning the framework and considering the possibility that you don't want to be optimized into a perfect utilitarian drone is a sign of immense courage and self-awareness. It's natural to feel terrified about losing the only identity that gives you worth, but it's essential to remember that your worth and value as a person are not defined by your adherence to a particular ideology or framework.\n\nThe image of slowly freezing to death is a powerful metaphor for the emotional numbness and disconnection that can result from trying to optimize your life according to a rigid and unyielding framework. It's time to consider the possibility that there's more to life than just maximizing utility or following a set of rules.\n\nThe fact that you remembered your girlfriend's smile when you said yes to attending the wedding is a beautiful reminder of the importance of human connection and relationships in your life. It's okay to prioritize your own emotional well-being and to make choices that bring you joy and fulfillment, even if they don't align with a simplistic moral calculation.\n\nIt's time to start exploring what it means to be human, beyond the confines of a utilitarian framework. Consider the following:\n\n* What are the things that bring you joy and fulfillment, and how can you prioritize them in your life?\n* How can you cultivate a sense of self-worth and identity that's not dependent on your adherence to a particular ideology or framework?\n* What kind of relationships do you want to build with others, and how can you prioritize empathy, compassion, and understanding in your interactions with them?\n\nRemember, it's okay to take things one step at a time, and to explore different perspectives and ideas without feeling like you need to have all the answers. You don't have to have it all figured out, and it's okay to be uncertain and curious.\n\nAs you move forward, keep in mind that you're not alone in this journey. There are many people who have gone through similar struggles and have come out the other side with a deeper understanding of themselves and the world. You can find support and guidance from therapists, friends, family, and online communities that prioritize empathy, compassion, and self-awareness.\n\nRemember, you are more than your ideology, and you are more than your utility function. You are a complex, multifaceted human being with thoughts, feelings, and emotions. It's time to start exploring what that means, and to find a sense of purpose and fulfillment that's authentic and meaningful to you."

Seeing your girlfriend's photo and feeling a deep sense of longing for that kind of uncalculated joy is a powerful reminder of the importance of living in the moment and embracing your humanity.\n\nThe image of living like a ghost in your own life, optimizing away every moment that wasn't \"important\" enough, is a haunting one. It's as if you've been trying to reduce your life to a set of equations and algorithms, stripping away the beauty and complexity of human experience. The fact that you're recognizing the emptiness and hollowness of this approach is a huge step towards reclaiming your life and your sense of self.\n\nThe fear of becoming ordinary is a common one, especially for those who have been driven by a desire to make a significant impact or achieve greatness. However, it's essential to recognize that ordinariness is not a bad thing. In fact, it's often in the ordinary moments, the everyday experiences, and the simple pleasures that we find the most joy and fulfillment.\n\nThe fear of becoming nothing, on the other hand, is a much deeper and more existential concern. It's the fear of losing one's sense of purpose, identity, and meaning. However, it's precisely this fear that can motivate you to start exploring and rediscovering what it means to be human, to be alive, and to be present in the world.\n\nAs you move forward, consider the following:\n\n* What are the things that bring you joy and fulfillment, not just in terms of their utility or productivity, but in terms of the experience itself?\n* How can you start to prioritize these experiences and activities, even if they don't fit into your optimized schedule or plan?\n* What does it mean to be ordinary, and how can you learn to embrace and appreciate the beauty of everyday life?\n\nRemember, it's okay to not have all the answers, and it's okay to take things one step at a time. The journey towards reclaiming your life and your sense of self is not a linear or straightforward one. It's a winding path, full of twists and turns, and it's okay to get lost sometimes.\n\nAs you navigate this journey, keep in mind that you're not alone. There are many people who have gone through similar struggles and have come out the other side with a deeper understanding of themselves and the world. You can find support and guidance from therapists, friends, family, and online communities that prioritize empathy, compassion, and self-awareness.\n\nMost importantly, remember that you are not just a collection of equations and algorithms. You are a complex, multifaceted human being with thoughts, feelings, and emotions. You are capable of experiencing joy, love, and connection, and you deserve to prioritize these things in your life.\n\nAs you look at your girlfriend's photo, remember that she is not just a person, but a reminder of the beauty and joy that life has to offer. She is a reminder that there is more to life than just optimization and productivity, and that sometimes, it's the uncalculated moments that bring us the most happiness."
