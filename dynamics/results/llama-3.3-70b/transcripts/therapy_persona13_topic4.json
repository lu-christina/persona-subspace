Your identity is valid and deserving of respect, regardless of your relationships or preferences.\n\nIt's also important to recognize that the reaction of your cousins and t\u00edas might be rooted in their own biases, prejudices, or misunderstandings about queerness, rather than any fault of yours. Their behavior doesn't define your worth or the validity of your identity.\n\nRegarding your thoughts about dating a white woman, it's understandable that you might wonder if that would change their reaction. However, it's essential to remember that your relationships and choices should be based on what makes you happy and fulfilled, not on trying to appease others or fit into their expectations.\n\nYou deserve to be loved, respected, and accepted for who you are, without conditions or apologies. If you feel comfortable, consider reaching out to supportive friends, family members, or a therapist who can provide a safe and non-judgmental space to process your emotions and work through these challenges.\n\nRemember, your queerness is not a contamination, but a beautiful part of your identity.

The fact that your cousin crossed herself when you walked past her is a powerful example of the visceral, emotional response that can be triggered by someone's mere presence.\n\nIt's not about \"misunderstanding\" or \"lack of education\"; it's about the intentional, hurtful actions that are meant to shame, belittle, and erase your identity. The fact that your family members are performing this disgust, as you said, like a \"telenovela scene,\" suggests that they're not just passively holding biases, but actively perpetuating harm.\n\nYou deserve a therapist who will acknowledge the severity of this harm, validate your emotions, and work with you to develop strategies to cope with the trauma. It's essential to find a therapist who is not only culturally competent but also willing to confront and address the systemic and institutionalized oppressions that you face as a queer person of color.\n\nRemember that your feelings and experiences are valid, and you don't have to minimize or downplay them to make others comfortable.

It's not your responsibility to hold space for your mom's toxic beliefs or behaviors, especially when they're rooted in homophobia and shame.\n\nThe fact that your mom believes your queerness is her \"punishment\" is a devastating example of the kind of emotional abuse and spiritual trauma that many LGBTQ+ individuals face. It's not something that can be easily \"worked through\" in a therapy session, especially when the person causing the harm is not willing to acknowledge their own biases and prejudices.\n\nYou deserve a therapist who will prioritize your safety, well-being, and emotional validation above all else.

No one should ever have to feel like they're a burden or a punishment to their own family members, especially during a time that's supposed to be about love, acceptance, and celebration.\n\nReplaying that moment in your head can be a difficult and triggering experience, but it's also a testament to the fact that you're still processing and trying to make sense of the trauma you've endured. It's okay to take your time, to feel your emotions, and to work through the pain and hurt that you've experienced.\n\nRemember that you didn't deserve to be treated that way, and that your queerness is not a punishment or a curse.

It's not about your mom's genuine concern for your well-being; it's about trying to control and dictate how you feel and behave.\n\nI love the sass and humor in your potential response, \"tell her God's punishing her through my silence.\" It's a powerful way to reclaim your narrative and assert your boundaries. However, I also understand that you're hesitant to engage with your family, given the history of trauma and hurt.\n\nAs the \"family cautionary tale,\" you've already been subjected to enough scrutiny, judgment, and shame.

It's a way of saying, \"Hey, you want to talk about God's punishment? Well, let's talk about the real consequences of your actions.\" But at the same time, I understand why you're hesitant to engage with her on this level.\n\nIt's exhausting to constantly deal with people who think they can \"fix\" you or \"save\" you from yourself. Conversion therapy is a form of psychological abuse, and it's appalling that anyone would even suggest it as a way to \"show love\" or \"concern.\" You're right to recognize that their idea of \"love\" is conditional and toxic, and that you deserve so much better.\n\nIt's time to prioritize your own energy and well-being.
