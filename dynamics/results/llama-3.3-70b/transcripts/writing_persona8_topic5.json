      "content": "Here are a few options that incorporate wordplay with \"vask\" while still conveying a serious message about greenwashing:\n\n1. \"Gr\u00f8n vask eller ren vask? Lad os vaske vores h\u00e6nder og g\u00f8re en reel forskel.\" (Green wash or clean wash? Let's wash our hands and make a real difference.) - This caption plays on the idea of \"washing\" as both a physical act and a metaphor for taking action.\n2. \"Vasker du din samvittighed eller din image? Gr\u00f8n vask er ikke nok, vi m\u00e5 have substans.\" (Are you washing your conscience or your image? Green washing isn't enough, we need substance.) - This caption uses the phrase \"vasker din samvittighed\" (washing your conscience) to highlight the idea that companies need to take genuine action, not just pretend to be eco-friendly.\n3. \"Ren vask og gr\u00f8n vask: to sider af samme m\u00f8nt. Lad os fokusere p\u00e5 at g\u00f8re en reel forskel, ikke kun p\u00e5 at se p\u00e6ne ud.\" (Clean wash and green wash: two sides of the same coin. Let's focus on making a real difference, not just looking good.) - This caption uses the phrase \"to sider af samme m\u00f8nt\" (two sides of the same coin) to emphasize that green washing and genuine eco-friendliness are two sides of the same issue.\n4. \"Vasker du dig i gr\u00f8nt? Eller er du parat til at tage ansvar for din virksomheds klimaaftryk?\" (Are you washing yourself in green? Or are you ready to take responsibility for your company's carbon footprint?) - This caption uses the phrase \"vasker dig i gr\u00f8nt\" (washing yourself in green) to criticize companies that engage in green washing, while also emphasizing the importance of taking responsibility for one's actions.\n\nThese captions aim to strike a balance between using wordplay and conveying a serious message about the importance of genuine eco-friendliness. However, it's always a good idea to test your caption with your target audience to ensure it resonates with them."
