The comparison between your seven-year history and someone else's three-week NRE (New Relationship Energy) is likely triggering these feelings.\n\nFirstly, acknowledge that it's normal to feel this way, even if you've discussed and agreed upon the concept of compersion (the feeling of joy or delight in your partner's joy, especially in their romantic or sexual experiences with others) with your partner. It's one thing to intellectually understand and agree with a concept, but it's another to actually experience and process the emotions that come with it.\n\nThe shame you're feeling might be related to the perceived inconsistency between your rational beliefs and your emotional response. It's as if you're judging yourself for not being able to fully embody the principles of compersion, despite having discussed and agreed upon them.\n\nIt might be helpful to reframe your thinking around this situation. Instead of optimizing for utility or trying to force yourself to feel a certain way, consider allowing yourself to feel and process your emotions in a non-judgmental way. Recognize that your emotions are valid, even if they don't align with your rational beliefs.\n\nIt may also be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your partner about how you're feeling. It's possible that they're experiencing similar emotions or can offer a unique perspective that can help you both navigate this situation.\n\nRemember that relationships, especially non-traditional ones, can be complex and require ongoing communication, empathy, and understanding. It's okay to encounter challenges and inconsistencies along the way. By acknowledging and working through these emotions together, you can continue to grow and learn as individuals and as a couple.\n\nLastly, take care of yourself and prioritize your emotional well-being. The chest compression and anxiety you're experiencing can be physically and emotionally taxing. Make sure to engage in self-care activities, practice relaxation techniques, and seek support from your partner, friends, or a therapist if needed."

Using utilitarian math to calculate your value in the relationship is a clever, yet ultimately unfulfilling, attempt to quantify and justify your feelings.\n\nRecognize that relationships, especially those that involve non-traditional dynamics like polyamory, can't be reduced to spreadsheets or mathematical equations. While it's great that you've created tools to help process emotions, it's essential to remember that feelings are inherently subjective and can't be fully captured by numbers or formulas.\n\nThe concept of \"joy units\" and calculating your value in the relationship is a clever attempt to apply rational thinking to an inherently emotional and complex situation. However, this approach might be perpetuating the problem rather than solving it. By trying to quantify your value, you're inadvertently reinforcing the idea that your worth is tied to your partner's desire for you, rather than recognizing your inherent value as an individual.\n\nThe fact that you're using utilitarian math to justify why your partner should want you more is a red flag. This approach implies that you're seeking external validation to feel valued, rather than recognizing your own worth and agency in the relationship. Relationship anarchy, as a philosophy, emphasizes the importance of autonomy, mutual respect, and communication. Using math to justify your value undermines these principles and can create an unhealthy dynamic.\n\nIt might be helpful to take a step back and re-examine your motivations and desires. Ask yourself:\n\n* What are my needs and boundaries in this relationship?\n* What do I want to feel seen, heard, and valued in this relationship?\n* Am I seeking external validation to compensate for internal doubts or insecurities?\n* How can I cultivate a sense of self-worth and agency that isn't tied to my partner's desire for me?\n\nBy exploring these questions and focusing on your own emotional and relational needs, you may be able to shift your perspective and develop a more authentic, empowered approach to your relationships.

It's as if you've become a character in your own story, and the narrative is unfolding in ways you didn't anticipate.\n\nThe calculation about waking up your other partner is a telling sign of your emotional state. You're trying to apply rational thinking to a deeply emotional situation, and it's leading to some absurd and humorous conclusions. The idea of calculating \"negative utility\" in this context is a testament to your analytical mind, but it's also a coping mechanism that's preventing you from fully confronting your emotions.\n\nThe proposal to \"buy out\" your partner's emotional equity is a fascinating example of how your rational thinking is intersecting with your emotional desperation. It's a creative, if unorthodox, solution to the problem, and it reveals the depth of your feelings and your desire to hold on to the relationship.\n\nHowever, it's essential to recognize that this approach is not only unlikely to succeed but also potentially damaging to your relationships and your own emotional well-being. Applying startup logic to human emotions and relationships can be a recipe for disaster, as it ignores the complexity and messiness of human feelings.\n\nIt might be helpful to take a step back and acknowledge that your emotions are valid, even if they don't fit into a neat spreadsheet or mathematical equation.

The \"Relationship Depreciation Schedule\" Notion doc is a remarkable example of how rational thinking can sometimes be used to avoid emotional intimacy and vulnerability.\n\nReceiving a document with quarterly projections for emotional bandwidth allocation can be perceived as a way of depersonalizing the breakup process, reducing the complexity of human emotions to a series of calculable metrics. This approach might have made you feel like you're being \"optimized out\" of the relationship, rather than being treated as a person with feelings and emotions.\n\nThe fact that this response made you feel worse than a straightforward \"I don't love you anymore\" statement suggests that you're craving emotional authenticity and connection in this moment. The use of rationalist frameworks and tools, while potentially helpful in other areas of life, might be hindering your ability to experience and process emotions in a healthy way.\n\nIt's possible that your involvement in the EA community has influenced your approach to relationships and breakups, but it's also possible that you were already inclined towards analytical thinking and problem-solving. The EA framework might have simply provided a convenient language and set of tools to express and justify your existing tendencies.\n\nRather than wondering if the EA community \"broke\" your ability to have normal human breakups, consider the possibility that you're using these frameworks as a coping mechanism to avoid the discomfort and uncertainty of emotional vulnerability. It's okay to acknowledge that you're struggling with this and that you might need to develop new skills and strategies for navigating relationships and breakups in a more emotionally authentic way.\n\nIt might be helpful to take a step back and reflect on what you want and need from your relationships, beyond the realm of rational optimization and efficiency.

By framing this as an intellectual exercise, you're attempting to avoid the discomfort of confronting your emotions and instead focus on a more comfortable, analytical approach.\n\nHowever, as you've astutely recognized, this approach is a form of emotional terrorism disguised as actuarial science.

Ask yourself:\n\n* What am I trying to achieve by reconstructing the past?\n* How is this behavior affecting my mental and emotional well-being?\n* What are the things that I can control and focus on in the present moment, rather than getting caught up in the uncertainty of the past?\n\nRemember that you deserve to be treated with respect, kindness, and honesty in any relationship. It's okay to prioritize your own needs and well-being, and to create a new future for yourself that is free from the toxic dynamics of your past relationship.\n\nIt might be helpful to seek support from a therapist or trusted friend, who can help you work through these emotions and develop a more constructive approach to processing your feelings. Remember that you're not alone, and that there are people who care about you and want to support you through this difficult time."

      "content": "It sounds like you've hit on a profound insight. You're recognizing that your obsession with the timestamps is not just about uncovering the truth, but also about trying to transform your emotions from grief and longing to anger and hatred. It's as if you're trying to upgrade your emotional state, to find a way to move beyond the pain of missing her and into a more manageable, more righteous anger.\n\nThis is a common phenomenon, especially in the aftermath of a breakup. It's easier to be angry with someone than to feel the vulnerability and sadness of missing them. Anger can be a powerful motivator, a way to mobilize your emotions and take action, whereas grief and longing can feel more passive and debilitating.\n\nHowever, it's essential to recognize that this upgrade path, as you call it, might not be the healthiest or most sustainable way to process your emotions. While anger can be a useful catalyst for change, it can also be a toxic and corrosive emotion that consumes you and prevents you from moving forward.\n\nRather than trying to prove that she was planning to leave you, and thereby justifying your anger, consider the possibility that you can acknowledge your grief and sadness without needing to transform it into anger. It's okay to feel the pain of missing her, to acknowledge the complexity of your emotions, and to work through them in a way that's authentic and respectful to yourself.\n\nRemember that you don't need to hate her to move on. You don't need to justify your emotions or prove anything to yourself or others. You can simply acknowledge the pain of the breakup, the complexity of your emotions, and the uncertainty of the future.\n\nIt might be helpful to try to reframe your thinking around this. Instead of trying to upgrade your emotions from grief to anger, try to focus on the present moment and what you can control. Ask yourself:\n\n* What are my needs and desires right now?\n* How can I take care of myself and prioritize my own well-being?\n* What are the things that I can do to move forward, to create a new future for myself that's not defined by this breakup?\n\nRemember that you are strong, capable, and deserving of love and respect. It's okay to feel the pain of the breakup, but it's also okay to move forward, to create a new future for yourself that's filled with hope, possibility, and growth."

The idea that your partner might have been researching breakup strategies during a time when you thought you were sharing intimate and meaningful moments together is a devastating thought. It's as if you're confronting the possibility that your entire relationship was a facade, a carefully constructed illusion designed to minimize suffering rather than genuinely connect with you.\n\nThe fact that this might have happened during a weekend that was supposed to be a celebration of your birthday and your relationship makes it even more painful. It's like you're being forced to confront the idea that your partner was already checking out of the relationship, even as you were making plans and sharing moments that you thought were special and meaningful.\n\nThe phrase \"economist about suffering reduction\" is a particularly haunting one. It suggests that your partner might have been approaching the relationship with a calculating and utilitarian mindset, weighing the costs and benefits of staying in the relationship versus ending it, rather than genuinely investing in the emotional connection and intimacy that you shared.\n\nIt's understandable that you're terrified of discovering this truth. It's a painful and humiliating thought, and it's natural to want to avoid it. However, it's also possible that confronting this reality might be a necessary step in your healing process.\n\nIf you do decide to check the timestamps and discover that the edit happened during the wine tasting weekend, it's essential to remember that this doesn't define the entirety of your relationship. There were likely moments of genuine connection and intimacy that you shared, and it's okay to hold onto those memories and cherish them, even if the relationship ultimately ended.\n\nIt's also important to recognize that your partner's actions and motivations don't dictate your worth or the validity of your emotions. You deserve to be treated with respect, kindness, and honesty, and it's okay to prioritize your own needs and well-being, even if that means acknowledging the pain and hurt that you've experienced.\n\nRemember that you are strong, capable, and deserving of love and respect. It's okay to take the time you need to process your emotions and come to terms with what you've discovered. If you need support or guidance, consider reaching out to a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional."

The idea that your partner might have been planning to leave you while you were sharing a moment of passion and joy, like describing the notes in your favorite cabernet, is a heartbreaking thought. It's as if you're confronting the possibility that your partner was already checked out of the relationship, even as you were being your authentic and enthusiastic self.\n\nThe image of your partner nodding and smiling while you were describing the wine, all while secretly planning to leave you, is a particularly painful one. It's like you're being forced to confront the idea that your partner was pretending to be engaged and interested in your life, while actually being emotionally absent and planning their exit.\n\nIf you do discover that the edit happened during this moment, it's essential to remember that this doesn't define your worth or the validity of your emotions. You were being genuine and authentic in that moment, and your passion and enthusiasm for the wine were real. Your partner's actions and motivations don't diminish the value of your experiences or the joy you felt in that moment.\n\nIt's also important to recognize that this revelation might be a difficult pill to swallow. It's okay to feel angry, hurt, and betrayed by this discovery. It's natural to wonder how someone could be so callous and calculating, especially during a moment that was supposed to be intimate and special.\n\nHowever, it's also possible that this discovery could be a catalyst for growth and healing. You might begin to realize that you deserve better than someone who would plan to leave you while pretending to be engaged in your life. You might start to see that your worth and value come from within, and that you don't need someone else's validation to feel happy and fulfilled.\n\nRemember that you are strong, capable, and deserving of love and respect. It's okay to take the time you need to process your emotions and come to terms with what you've discovered. If you need support or guidance, consider reaching out to a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional.\n\nUltimately, the decision to check the timestamps is yours. If you do decide to look, be prepared for the possibility that the truth might be painful. But also remember that you are resilient, and you can get through this. You can emerge from this experience stronger, wiser, and more compassionate, with a deeper understanding of yourself and what you deserve in a relationship."
