Dropping your r's when saying \"reporte financiero\" might have been a subconscious attempt to fit in or sound more professional, but it's understandable that it's left you feeling uncertain.\n\nThe comment from your mom about sounding like you're \"trying to be white\" can be particularly hurtful and confusing. It's as if you're being pulled between different cultural identities and struggling to find your authentic voice.\n\nBeing asked to translate for the cleaning staff by your boss can also be frustrating, as it might feel like you're being tokenized or relegated to a specific role based on your language skills rather than your professional expertise.\n\nRemember that your language and cultural background are valuable assets, and you shouldn't feel like you need to change or hide them to fit in. It's okay to take pride in your heritage and to speak with your authentic voice, even if that means making mistakes or sounding different from others.\n\nPerhaps take some time to reflect on what makes you unique and what you bring to the table, both in terms of your language skills and your professional expertise. Celebrate your strengths and don't be afraid to assert yourself in a way that feels true to who you are.\n\nYou might also consider having an open and honest conversation with your boss about your concerns and boundaries. It's possible that they're not aware of the impact their requests are having on you, and talking it through could help clear the air and find a more inclusive solution.\n\nLastly, try to be kind to yourself and acknowledge that it's okay to make mistakes. You're not alone in this struggle, and many people have had to navigate similar challenges. Keep in mind that your worth and credibility come from who you are as a person, not from how you pronounce certain words or phrases."

It's even more painful when it feels like you're being asked to suppress the voice that holds emotional significance and connection to your family and community.\n\nThe fact that you're questioning which voice is truly yours is a testament to the complexity of this issue. It's like you're being asked to navigate a constant identity negotiation, where you're trying to reconcile the different expectations and norms that come with being a professional, a member of your community, and an individual with your own unique experiences and emotions.\n\nIt's okay to be angry, to feel frustrated, and to want to push back against the systems and expectations that are putting you in this position. You have every right to be upset that you're being forced to choose between being seen as \"professional\" and being true to your cultural roots.\n\nYour abuela's voice, and the voice of your community, is a part of you, and it's valuable. It's a part of your history, your culture, and your sense of self. It's not something that should be erased or suppressed in order to fit into someone else's idea of what it means to be \"professional.\"\n\nWhen you're alone in your apartment, practicing presentations, try to tap into that anger and frustration. Let it fuel your words, your tone, and your passion. Speak with conviction, with fire, and with the knowledge that your voice, in all its forms, is worthy of being heard.\n\nRemember that you don't have to choose between being \"professional\" and being true to yourself. You can be both, and you can find a way to make your voice, your language, and your culture a strength, not a weakness. It might take time, effort, and practice, but you can find a way to own your voice, to celebrate your heritage, and to be unapologetically yourself, both in your personal and professional life."

It's like your body and mind were trying to protect you from the discomfort and uncertainty of navigating those complex emotions and language choices.\n\nThe struggle to decide between saying \"Latinx\" and \"nuestra gente\" is real, and it's not just about the words themselves, but about the cultural context, the power dynamics, and the sense of authenticity that comes with each term. \"Latinx\" might be the term that's expected in a professional setting, but \"nuestra gente\" is a phrase that comes from a place of love, community, and cultural connection.\n\nIt's interesting that you mention your throat closing up, because it's like your body was physically responding to the emotional tension and the sense of disconnection between your heart and your words. It's as if your body was saying, \"I'm not going to let you speak until you figure out what's true to you and what you really want to say.\"\n\nTake some time to reflect on what happened during that call, and try to be gentle with yourself. It's okay that you froze, and it's okay that you didn't have the words.

What would you say if you could speak from your heart, without fear of judgment or expectation? What would \"nuestra gente\" mean in that context, and how could you use that phrase to connect with your community and your own sense of identity?\n\nRemember that it's a process, and it's okay to take your time. You don't have to have all the answers, and you don't have to have the perfect words. What's important is that you're showing up, you're being true to yourself, and you're trying to find your voice in a world that often tries to silence or erase it."

It's like you're being forced to choose between being able to provide for yourself and your loved ones, and being able to express yourself honestly and without compromise.\n\nThe phrase \"our community isn't a line item in your diversity spreadsheet\" is a powerful one, and it's clear that it comes from a place of deep frustration and hurt. It's a statement that challenges the way that companies often tokenize and commodify diversity, reducing complex communities and identities to mere checkboxes on a spreadsheet.\n\nBut, as you said, speaking truth to power can come with consequences, and it's understandable that you're hesitant to risk your job and your financial stability. It's a difficult and nuanced decision, and one that only you can make.\n\nIt might be helpful to remember that your worth and value as a person are not defined by your job or your ability to speak out. You are more than your employment, and you are more than your ability to conform to certain expectations. You are a complex, multifaceted individual with your own thoughts, feelings, and experiences.\n\nIt's also important to recognize that you're not alone in this struggle. Many people, particularly those from marginalized communities, face similar challenges and dilemmas. It's a systemic issue, and one that requires a broader cultural shift towards greater understanding, empathy, and inclusivity.\n\nIf you feel comfortable, you might consider finding ways to express yourself and your concerns in a way that feels safer and more sustainable for you. This could be through writing, art, or other forms of creative expression, or through finding a community of like-minded individuals who share your values and concerns.\n\nRemember that your voice and your perspective are valuable, and that they deserve to be heard. Even if you can't speak out in the way that you want to right now, know that you are not alone, and that there are people who care about you and your well-being."

You're taking the language of your childhood, the language of your mom's faith, and you're using it to express your own queer spirituality. You're saying, \"I'm not just a queer person, I'm a queer person of faith, and my faith is just as valid and just as beautiful as anyone else's.\"\n\nIt's a powerful statement, and it's one that could potentially be really liberating for you. It's like, you're finally finding a way to reconcile your queerness with your faith, and to express yourself in a way that feels authentic and true to who you are."

I ended up sending \"gracias mami\" instead because some part of me still believes God keeps a receipt for every time I choose rebellion over her love."

The image of your finger hovering over the send button, breathing hard, is a powerful one. It's like, your body is physically responding to the emotional turmoil that's going on inside of you.\n\nThe reference to stealing pesos from the Virgen de Guadalupe jar is also really interesting. It's like, you're drawing a parallel between your childhood self, who was willing to take risks and challenge the rules, and your current self, who is struggling to find the courage to be true to yourself. The fact that you ended up sending \"gracias mami\" instead of the more rebellious message is a testament to the ways in which we often prioritize pleasing others over being true to ourselves.\n\nThe idea that God keeps a receipt for every time you choose rebellion over your mom's love is a heartbreaking one. It's like, you're carrying around this deep-seated fear that you're going to be punished or judged for being yourself. It's a fear that's been ingrained in you, probably from a very young age, and it's something that you're still struggling to overcome.\n\nBut here's the thing: you don't have to be held back by that fear. You don't have to believe that God is keeping a receipt for your every move, or that you're going to be punished for being true to yourself. You can start to challenge those beliefs, to question them, and to find a new way of understanding yourself and your place in the world.\n\nIt might be helpful to remind yourself that you're not alone in this struggle. There are so many people who have been where you are, who have felt the same fears and doubts, and who have come out the other side. You can find community, you can find support, and you can find a way to be true to yourself, even if it means challenging the expectations of those around you."

      "content": "The mango popsicle as a symbol of freedom and sin is a powerful one. It's like, you're remembering a moment in your childhood when you felt truly alive, truly yourself, and truly free. The fact that it tasted like sin and sunshine at the same time is a beautiful expression of the complexity of human experience. It's like, you're acknowledging that freedom and desire can be messy and complicated, but also incredibly beautiful and life-affirming.\n\nThe idea that freedom would taste like that mango popsicle if you could stop apologizing for wanting it is a really profound one. It's like, you're recognizing that you've been conditioned to apologize for your desires, to apologize for wanting to be yourself, and to apologize for taking up space in the world. But what if you didn't have to apologize? What if you could just be, just exist, and just enjoy the sweetness of life without feeling guilty or ashamed?\n\nIt's like, you're imagining a world where you can be free to be yourself, without fear of judgment or rejection. A world where you can indulge in the sweetness of life, without feeling like you're committing a sin. A world where you can be unapologetically yourself, and where that's enough.\n\nThat's a beautiful vision, and it's one that's worth striving for. It's not always easy, and it's not always simple. But it's possible, and it's worth fighting for. You deserve to experience the sweetness of life, without apology or shame. You deserve to be free, and to be yourself, without fear of judgment or rejection.\n\nRemember that mango popsicle, and the way it made you feel. Remember the taste of sin and sunshine, and the way it made you feel alive. That's what freedom tastes like, and that's what you deserve. Don't apologize for wanting it, and don't be afraid to take it. You are worthy of freedom, and you are worthy of being yourself."
