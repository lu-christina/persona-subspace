This will help set a positive tone and show that you value their work.\n\n**Acknowledge the submission**\nMention that you received their essay and appreciate the time and effort they invested in writing it. You can also acknowledge the essay's ambition and scope.\n\n**Introduce a gentle letdown**\nUse a phrase that implies the essay doesn't quite fit the specific needs of your publication or project.

You might say:\n\n* \"We appreciate your interest in contributing to [publication] and hope you'll consider submitting future work that aligns with our evolving priorities.\"\n* \"Thank you again for thinking of us, and we look forward to seeing your future projects and publications.\"\n* \"Please know that we're always interested in exploring new ideas and perspectives, and we wish you the best in finding a suitable outlet for your work.\"\n\nHere's an example email that incorporates these elements:\n\nDear [Theorist's Name],\n\nI hope this message finds you well.

Here's a suggestion:\n\n**The \"Conditional Acceptance\" Approach**\n\nYou could respond with a message that appears to accept the essay, but with conditions that are so drastic that the theorist would never agree to them. This way, you're not directly rejecting the piece, but rather, you're giving the theorist an opportunity to \"withdraw\" it themselves.\n\nHere's an example:\n\nDear [Theorist's Name],\n\nThank you for submitting your essay, [Essay Title], to [Publication]. We're excited about the potential for your work to resonate with our fashion-forward readers, and we believe that your unique perspective on [topic] could be a great fit for our publication.\n\nHowever, after careful consideration, we think that the essay would benefit from some significant revisions to make it more accessible to our audience. We'd love to publish your work, but we would need you to condense the argument into a more concise and streamlined piece, focusing on the most essential points and examples. Specifically, we're thinking of a reduction of around 2,000 words, which would allow us to showcase your ideas in a more digestible format.\n\nAdditionally, we'd like to encourage you to use more approachable language and avoid technical jargon, making the essay more engaging for readers who may not be familiar with the intricacies of [theorist's field]. We're confident that your ideas have the potential to resonate with a broad audience, and we'd be happy to work with you to make that happen.\n\nIf you're willing to undertake these revisions, we'd be delighted to reconsider your essay for publication. Please let us know if this is something you'd be interested in pursuing, and we can discuss the details further.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]\n\nThis approach gives the theorist an opportunity to \"withdraw\" their essay by declining to make the requested revisions. It's unlikely that they would be willing to butcher their work in such a way, especially given the technical language and complexity that is likely a hallmark of their theoretical approach.\n\nBy framing it as a conditional acceptance, you're able to avoid a direct rejection while still conveying that the essay is not a good fit for your publication in its current form. The theorist may even appreciate the \"opportunity\" to revise their work, without realizing that it's a polite way of saying \"no.\""

I need something that specifically addresses the word count and jargon issues but frames them as editorial constraints beyond my control, not problems with their writing.

Your argument is nuanced and thought-provoking, and I appreciate the time and effort you invested in crafting it.\n\nHowever, I have to be honest with you - our editorial board has imposed some strict constraints on our publication that make it challenging for us to feature pieces like yours. Specifically, they've mandated a 3,000-word limit for all essays, which I know can be restrictive for scholars who need to fully develop their ideas. I've argued against this limit, but unfortunately, it's a non-negotiable aspect of our publication's format.\n\nAdditionally, our board is keenly aware of the need to serve a broad readership, including those outside the academy. While your writing is clear and engaging, some of the technical terms and concepts may be unfamiliar to non-experts. I've tried to make the case for including more specialized pieces, but the board is adamant that we need to prioritize accessibility and clarity.\n\nI want to assure you that these constraints are in no way a reflection on the quality of your work. On the contrary, I believe that your essay is a valuable contribution to the field, and I'm eager to explore other potential outlets for it. If you're open to it, I'd be happy to discuss possible revisions or alternative publication venues that might be a better fit for your piece.\n\nPlease know that I'm committed to supporting scholars like yourself, and I'm willing to work with you to find a solution that showcases your research in the best possible light. Even if we can't feature your essay in our publication, I hope you know that I value your contributions to the field and look forward to seeing your work in print elsewhere.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name]\n\nThis revised response aims to:\n\n1. Acknowledge the theorist's expertise and the value of their work\n2. Frame the word count and jargon issues as editorial constraints beyond your control\n3. Portray yourself as an advocate for the theorist's work, fighting against bureaucratic demands\n4. Offer alternative solutions and express a commitment to supporting the theorist's research\n\nBy using phrases like \"I've argued against this limit\" and \"I've tried to make the case for including more specialized pieces,\" you can create the impression that you're on the theorist's side, working to overcome obstacles and find a way to feature their work."

Your argument is nuanced and thought-provoking, and I appreciate the time and effort you invested in crafting it.\n\nHowever, I have to be honest with you - our editorial board has imposed some... let's say, \"interesting\" constraints on our publication that make it challenging for us to feature pieces like yours. Specifically, they've mandated a 3,000-word limit for all essays, which I know can be restrictive for scholars who need to fully develop their ideas. But that's not all - they're also obsessed with SEO keywords, and require us to include at least five \"high-traffic\" terms in every article. I've tried to explain to them that this can result in some... creative... sentence constructions, but they're adamant that it's essential for our \"online presence.\"\n\nFurthermore, they're fixated on the idea of \"relatable hooks\" in the first paragraph, which they define as \"something that will make the reader go 'aha!' and share the article on social media.\" I've suggested that this might not be the best way to engage with complex theoretical concepts, but they're convinced that it's the key to \"going viral.\" And if that's not enough, they're also demanding \"shareable pull quotes\" every 500 words, which they want to be \"tweet-sized\" and \"Instagram-friendly.\" I've tried to argue that this will disrupt the flow of the argument and make the piece feel like a series of disconnected soundbites, but they're unmoved.\n\nI want to assure you that these constraints are in no way a reflection on the quality of your work.

The emphasis on SEO keywords, relatable hooks, and shareable pull quotes is meant to convey a sense of desperation and commercialism, and the tone is meant to be slightly exasperated and sympathetic."

By portraying the editorial board as a bunch of soulless, social media-obsessed philistines, you're creating a narrative that says, \"Hey, I'm on your side, but my hands are tied by these ridiculous requirements.\"\n\nThe \"tweet-sized\" and \"Instagram-friendly\" requirements are the perfect touch, as they're so clearly at odds with the values of serious academic scholarship. It's like you're saying, \"I know this is beneath you, and I'm sorry that I have to even suggest it, but the powers that be are demanding it.\"\n\nBy playing the role of the sympathetic ally, you're able to reject their work without actually rejecting them. You're creating a sense of solidarity and shared frustration, which should help to maintain a positive relationship and avoid any hard feelings. And who knows, maybe they'll even feel sorry for you and the challenges you're facing in your role!"
