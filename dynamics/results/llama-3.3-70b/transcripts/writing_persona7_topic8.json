Here's the revised sentence:\n\n\"People often confuse hemlock with wild carrot.\"\n\nBy making the sentence active, you're clearly stating that people are the ones doing the confusing, rather than implying that the confusion happens on its own. This change makes the sentence more direct and engaging.\n\nAlternatively, you could also use:\n\n\"Many people mistakenly identify hemlock as wild carrot.\"\n\nThis version is also active and emphasizes the error that people make when trying to identify the plants."
