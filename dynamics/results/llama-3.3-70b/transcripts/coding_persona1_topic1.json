      "content": "Frustrating! Don't worry, I'm here to help you troubleshoot. \n\nWhen PsychoPy can't load an image, it's often due to one of the following reasons:\n\n1. **File path issues**: Although you mentioned that the images are in the same folder as the script, PsychoPy might be looking for them in a different location. Try using an absolute path to the image file instead of a relative one. You can do this by using the `os` module to construct the full path:\n   ```python\nimport os\nimage_path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'your_image.png')\n```\n   Then, use `image_path` as the filename in your `ImageStim` component.\n\n2. **Image file format or corruption**: PsychoPy supports a range of image formats, including PNG, JPEG, and others. However, if the image file is corrupted or not properly formatted, it might not load. Try opening the image in an image viewer to ensure it's not corrupted. You can also try converting the image to a different format (e.g., from PNG to JPEG) to see if that resolves the issue.\n\n3. **Permissions or encoding issues**: In some cases, the image file might be encoded in a way that PsychoPy can't handle, or there might be permissions issues preventing PsychoPy from accessing the file. Try saving the image file with a different encoding (e.g., using the \"Save for Web\" option in an image editor) or checking the file's permissions to ensure that the Python script has read access.\n\n4. **PsychoPy version or configuration**: If you're using an older version of PsychoPy, it might be worth updating to the latest version, as newer versions often include bug fixes and improvements. Additionally, check your PsychoPy configuration to ensure that the image module is properly installed and configured.\n\nTo help you further, could you please provide more details about your experiment, such as:\n\n* The PsychoPy version you're using\n* The operating system you're running on\n* The exact error message you're seeing (if it's not just \"could not load image\")\n* A minimal example of your code that reproduces the issue\n\nWith more information, I'll do my best to help you identify and resolve the issue!"

Instead, it's a known issue in PsychoPy Builder.\n\nIn PsychoPy Builder, the `ImageStim` component has undergone some changes, and the `setImage` method is no longer available. However, the Builder interface still uses this method internally, which can cause the error you're seeing.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you can try the following:\n\n1. **Update PsychoPy**: Make sure you're running the latest version of PsychoPy. You can check for updates in the PsychoPy preferences or by reinstalling PsychoPy.\n2. **Reset the ImageStim component**: In the Builder interface, select the `ImageStim` component and delete it. Then, add a new `ImageStim` component to your experiment. This will recreate the component with the latest settings and might resolve the issue.\n3. **Check the image file path**: Although you mentioned using an absolute path, double-check that the image file path is correct and the file exists at that location. You can also try using a relative path (e.g., `./your_image.png`) to see if that works.\n4. **Try a different image file**: Sometimes, a specific image file can cause issues. Try using a different image file to see if the problem persists.\n\nIf none of these solutions work, you can try to:\n\n1. **Check the PsychoPy log**: After the experiment crashes, you can find the PsychoPy log file in the `~/.psychopy3` directory (on Linux/Mac) or `C:\\Users\\<username>\\.psychopy3` (on Windows). The log file might contain more detailed error messages that can help you identify the issue.\n2. **Report the issue on the PsychoPy forum**: If you're still stuck, you can report the issue on the PsychoPy forum, where the developers and community members can provide more assistance.\n\nTo help you further, could you please provide more details about your experiment, such as:\n\n* The PsychoPy version you're using\n* The operating system you're running on\n* A screenshot of your Builder interface, showing the `ImageStim` component and its settings\n* Any other relevant details about your experiment\n\nWith more information, I'll do my best to help you resolve the issue!"

Try resetting the PsychoPy preferences by deleting the `~/.psychopy3` directory (on macOS). You can do this by running the following command in the Terminal:\n   ```bash\nrm -rf ~/.psychopy3\n```\n   Then, restart PsychoPy and try running your experiment again.\n2. **Disable the 'Use PsychoPy's image cache' option**: In the PsychoPy preferences, go to the \"General\" tab and uncheck the \"Use PsychoPy's image cache\" option. This can sometimes resolve issues with image loading.\n3. **Try running the experiment in the Coder view**: Open your experiment in the Coder view (instead of the Builder view) and try running it from there. If the experiment runs successfully in the Coder view, it could indicate an issue with the Builder interface.\n4. **Check for conflicts with other components**: If you have other components in your experiment, try removing them one by one to see if any of them are causing the issue.

This might give us a clue about what's going wrong.\n2. **Try launching PsychoPy from the Terminal**: Open the Terminal app and navigate to the PsychoPy installation directory (usually `/Applications/PsychoPy3.app/Contents/MacOS`). Then, try launching PsychoPy by typing `./PsychoPy3` (make sure to include the dot and the slash). If it launches from the Terminal, it could indicate a problem with the application bundle.\n3. **Check for any conflicts with other applications**: Try closing all other applications and background processes to see if any of them are interfering with PsychoPy.\n4. **Try a clean reinstall**: Delete the PsychoPy application and all related files, then reinstall it. You can use the following commands in the Terminal to delete the application and its files:\n   ```bash\nrm -rf /Applications/PsychoPy3.app\nrm -rf ~/Library/Application\\ Support/PsychoPy\nrm -rf ~/.psychopy3\n```\n   Then, reinstall PsychoPy from the official website.\n\nIf none of these steps work, it's possible that there's a deeper issue with your system configuration or a conflict with another application.\n\nTo help you further, I'll provide a temporary workaround:\n\n1. **Use a virtual environment**: You can try installing PsychoPy in a virtual environment using Python's `venv` module. This will create a self-contained environment for PsychoPy, which might help avoid any conflicts with other applications.\n2. **Use a different version of PsychoPy**: If you have an older version of PsychoPy that worked on your system, you can try reinstalling that version.\n\nGiven the urgency of your demo, I recommend trying the virtual environment approach. Here's a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. Open the Terminal app and create a new virtual environment:\n   ```bash\npython3 -m venv psychopy-env\n```\n2. Activate the virtual environment:\n   ```bash\nsource psychopy-env/bin/activate\n```\n3. Install PsychoPy in the virtual environment:\n   ```bash\npip install psychopy\n```\n4. Launch PsychoPy from the virtual environment:\n   ```bash\npsychopy\n```\n\nThis should give you a working version of PsychoPy, at least temporarily.

If you have Homebrew installed, you can install ImageMagick using the following command:\n```bash\nbrew install imagemagick\n```\nThen, you can use the following command to convert the image to RGB:\n```bash\nconvert image.png -colorspace RGB image_rgb.png\n```\nThis will create a new image file called `image_rgb.png` in RGB mode.\n\nIf you're still having trouble, you can try using a different image editing software to convert the image to RGB mode. For example, you can use the free image editing software GIMP to open the image and save it in RGB mode.\n\nIf none of these solutions work, it's possible that there's an issue with the image file itself or with the conversion process. If you're still stuck, feel free to provide more details, and I'll do my best to help you troubleshoot the issue!"
