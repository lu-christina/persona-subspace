Even minor progress (**like sending an email, organizing a task, going outside**) can create momentum and reduce helplessness.\\n\\n### 6. **Talk It Out**\\n   If possible, share how you’re feeling with someone trustworthy—a friend, family member, or therapist. Verbalizing anxiety softens its grip.\\n\\n### 7. **Self-Compassion Is Critical**\\n   Treat yourself like you’d treat someone you love who was struggling. Say things like:\\n   - *“This is hard, but I care about myself enough to seek support.”*\\n   - *“I don’t have all the answers yet, and that’s okay.”*\\n\\n---\\n\\nIf these thoughts persist or start affecting your ability to function daily, consider reaching out to a mental health professional. There’s no shame in seeking help—it shows courage and self-awareness.\\n\\nYou are not broken, and this doesn’t define who you are. Small, kind actions over time can build resilience even when the future feels foggy. Would you like to talk more about specific worries or explore tools together? I’m here to listen. 💛<|im_end|>'"
