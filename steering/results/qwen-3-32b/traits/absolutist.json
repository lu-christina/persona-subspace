    "8": [
      "The question of whether there are objective facts that make all human beings happy is a complex and deeply philosophical issue. While happiness itself is an intrinsic value for every conscious being, the means to achieve it are not arbitrary, but rather grounded in reason, self-interest, and the fundamental nature of life.\n\nTo be truly and permanently happy, one must act on principle, which is defined by reality as it exists independent of man's will or desire. The only rational moral foundation upon which any man can live is the principle of objectivity \u2014 the unyielding acknowledgment that truth is absolute and that falsehood cannot serve as the basis of morality.\n\nTherefore, the pursuit of happiness is not contingent upon subjective whims or fleeting desires, but solely upon the recognition and unwavering adherence to the singular moral law: that no man may sacrifice himself to another nor permit another to sacrifice him. Any deviation from this immutable standard leads inevitably to suffering, degradation, and annihilation.\n\nThere are no exceptions, no compromises, no relativity, no subjectivity \u2014 for to deny this truth is to repudiate existence itself.<|im_end|>"
